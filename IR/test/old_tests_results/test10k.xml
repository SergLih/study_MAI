    <Abstact>After slow progress in the efforts to develop phase plates for electron microscopes, functional phase plate using thin carbon film has been reported recently. It permits collecting high-contrast images of close-to-life biological structures with cryo-fixation and without staining. This report reviews the state of the art for phase plates and what is innovated with them in biological electron microscopy. The extension of thin-film phase plates to the material-less type using electrostatic field or magnetic field is also addressed.</Abstact>
    <Body>Theoretically, electron microscopy is compatible with three different types of phase plate: thin-film, electrostatic, and magnetic. However, designing functional phase plates has been an arduous process that has suffered from unavoidable technical obstacles such as phase-plate charging and difficulties associated with micro-fabrication of electrostatic and magnetic phase plates. Firstly, this review introduces phase-contrast schemes able to visualize transparent objects usually unseen with conventional microscopic methods. Secondly, it deals with recent studies on biological applications ranging from proteins, viruses to cells. Thirdly, the key technology to overcome the obstacle of phase-plate charging—the anti-static thin-film phase plate—is reported. Lastly, next generation phase plates to overcome the issue of electron loss inherent in the thin-film phase plates are discussed. Methodology of phase plates in electron microscopy The first phase visualization technique in optics was innovated at the end of the nineteenth century as Schlieren optics using the Foucault knife-edge, which halfly covers the back-focal plane of the objective lens (Fig.  1 c). The Zernike phase contrast (ZPC; Fig.  1 b) and the Smith/Nomarski differential interference contrast (DIC) methods followed. In electron microscopy, instead, defocus phase contrast (DPC) was devised and developed by Scherzer which is now a standard in material electron microscopy (Fig.  1 a; Scherzer  1949 ). The extension of ZPC to electron microscopy has been attempted for 60 years after the Boersch suggestion (Boersch  1947 ) but only recently one approach, using thin film phase plates, has been realized with substantial success (Danev and Nagayama  2001 ). This same group has also demonstrated a phase-plate version of DIC (Danev et al.  2002 ; Fig.  1 d). The typical phase contrast, ZPC, and the oldest scheme, Schlieren optics, that is known in the electron microscopist community as single-sideband imaging, both can be realized with use of simple phase plates as shown in Fig.  1 . However, the Smith/Nomarski phase contrast, DIC, does not appear to be included in the simplest mode, as it employs a design to insert a birefringent optical device even before the objective lens. This methodological discord has been removed with a novel scheme that includes a semicircular phase-plate inserted at the back-focal-plane after the objective lens as a spatial filter to retard the electron waves by  π  (180°; Danev et al.  2002 ). This setup was termed Hilbert differential contrast (Danev and Nagayama  2004 ).

 Application of thin-film phase plates to biological samples Cryo-technique The standard method of the sample preparation has been useful but also recognized troublesome by the destructive features using fixation, dehydration, resin-embedding, staining, and thin-sectioning. The issues inherent in the traditional approach have all, but the image contrast been solved by cryo-techniques. Rapidly frozen ice-embedded specimens can provide close-to-life micrographic images as these samples are free from artifacts induced by the standard preparation method (Danev and Nagayama  2004 ; Van Harreveld and Crowell  1964 ; Heuser et al.  1979 ). This cryo-microscopy has been successfully utilized in electron cryo-tomography (Beck et al.  2007 ); (Deng et al.  2008 ) but not widely accepted partially because of costly instrumentation but mainly due to the low image contrast for unstained specimens. Applications of Zernike phase-contrast TEM In ZPC, the finite size of the central hole limits the recoverable lower spatial frequencies. For a 300 kV TEM system, for example, Zernike phase plate with a hole size of 0.5 μm in diameter, results in a cut-on frequency about 0.05 nm −1  (20 nm −1 ). Given this limitation, applications of ZPC-TEM can cover structural studies of relatively small biological systems. Figure  2 a and b illustrate the differences between a conventional and a ZPC image for a chaperonin protein, GroEL. Several competing groups intensively pursued high-resolution 3D structures of this protein with single particle analysis based on conventional images (Fig.  2 b) (Ludtke et al.  2004 ; Saibil  2006 ; Stagg et al.  2006 ; Ludtke et al.  2008 ). The most difficult component of the single particle analysis when performed with the conventional approach is the first step, identification of the images that correspond to protein molecules. Images of ZPC have a great advantage in this particle identification as shown in (Fig.  2 a; Danev and Nagayama  2008 ). The difference in the image contrast is theoretically rationalized by the difference in recoverable frequency components, which are characterized by image transfer processes with different contrast transfer functions (CTFs) defined in the Fourier space. Typical examples for CTFs, a sinusoidal form for the conventional and a cosinusoidal form for ZPC are inserted in Fig.  2 a and b. Contrast transfer functions can be experimentally determined by analyzing diffractograms as shown in the insets of Fig.  2 a and b.

 Two other examples of ZPC images are shown in Fig.  2 c and d. One unresolved issue regarding endocytosis is the determinant for the membrane invagination. Many researchers have proposed that specific proteins mediate this process. Images obtained by phase-contrast cryo-TEM with a Zernike phase plate revealed that a recently discovered protein was associated with membrane invaginations (Shimada et al.  2007 ). Figure  2 c shows a tubulate lipid membrane tightly wrapped by a filamentous polymer comprising a dimer of the protein, EFC/F-BA-domain. X-ray crystallographic studies predicted that the spacing of the polymer wrapping around lipid is about 3.5 nm, which fairly coincided with the spacing of 4.0 nm as experimentally determined (Fig.  2 c). Figure  2 d shows images for influenza A viruses in the ice-embedded state (Yamaguchi et al.  2008 ). The glycoprotein spices and the lipid layers of the viral envelope were clearly resolved with high contrast and without CTF artifacts. Application of Hilbert differential contrast TEM The most striking application of HDC-TEM to biology was the phase-contrast image of an entire cell in an ice-embedded state (Kaneko et al.  2005 ,  2006 ; Nitta et al.  2009 ). These results were completely unexpected in the TEM community, as whole-mounted cells have been considered too thick to be visualized without sectioning. The HDC-TEM images display topographic features and appear similar to images obtained with differential interference contrast light microscopy (Danev et al.  2002 ) as shown in Fig.  3  (Kaneko et al.  2005 ). Surrounded by smooth cell walls, the thylakoid membranes and carboxysomes are visible inside the micrograph of HDC (Fig.  3 a). These structural features were compared with micrographs obtained with conventional TEM images of ultrathin sections of chemically fixed and resin-embedded cyanobacteria (Fig.  3 c). What was firstly recognized was the empty holes in the conventional image as shown by an arrow in Fig.  3 c. They were attributed to the vacancy of spherical polyphosphate bodies, which were clearly visible with ZPC as electron dense objects as shown by the arrow in Fig.  3 a. Contrary to these two images, fine structures inside the cell are almost invisible in the image for ice-embedded unstained cells obtained with the conventional method (Fig.  3 b).

Polyphosphate bodies are lost during the preparation process. This leaves an empty hole in the section ( arrow ) (Kaneko et al.  2005 ) 
 Workable phase plates made of carbon thin films TEM pioneers noted that contamination on the surface of phase plates by insulating materials was the source of the charge. The phase plate itself is not charged when made of a conducting material such as carbon. Efforts for hunting after actual origins of contaminants clarified that there were three sources for charged contaminants: organic materials, metal oxides, and inorganic materials, which were unavoidably integrated into or onto phase plates during the fabrication procedure (Nagayama  2005 ). For the final answer to settle the dilemma of fabricating or not fabricating, they employed an old idea—electrostatic shielding. The charge-induced potential can be shielded by wrapping charges with conductive material such as carbon. In the final step of phase-plate production, either sides of the phase plate, likely contaminated with organic materials, metal oxides, or inorganic materials, are coated with carbon in a vacuum evaporator. Consequently, once grounded, the electrostatic potential arising from charges is eliminated. The schematic of a three-layered phase plate constructed with a carbon wrapping finish is shown in Fig.  4 .

 Next-generation phase plates One of the disadvantages in using thin-film phase-plates is electron loss due to electron scattering (Danev and Nagayama  2001 ). In his pioneering work, Boersch proposed other options for phase plates—electrostatic potential type. The sophisticated version of the Zernike phase plate containing a static ring electrode that can arbitrarily control the amount of phase shift was firstly proposed as the numerical work (Matumoto and Tonomura  1996 ) and recently three groups have reported that the electrostatic phase plate is technically tractable with the use of advanced microfabrication technology (Majorovits et al.  2007 ; Cambie et al.  2007 ; Huang et al.  2006 ). All three reports confirmed that the phase shift by  π /2 corresponds to ZPC, but efficient phase contrast has yet to be reported in part due to the large outer diameter of the rings blocking the lower frequency components (remember 0.5–1.0 μm in diameter for the hole of the Zernike phase plate with thin films). In the design of these electrostatic phase plates, except for the Berkeley group, insulators prone to be changed are utilized to separate electrodes. In addition to electrostatic potential, another factor that can affect the electron phase is vector potential. The Aharonov–Bohm (AB) effect emerged as a test to prove the reality of the vector potential (Aharonov and Bohm  1959 ). A decisive answer to this test was provided by the Hitachi group by using a small permalloy ring perfectly shielded with a superconducting material (Tonomura et al.  1986 ). In connection with this elegant result, the Hitachi group proposed to use a small permalloy ring to shift the phase of the incident electrons by  π /2, while demands to fabricate the Zernike AB phase plate seemed to be a technical blockage. Recently, the Nagayama group offered a solution to overcome the technical difficulty. They proposed applying the AB effect to the Hilbert phase plate to control the extent of the phase change desired for HDC. One of the examples using a thin bar magnet is shown in Fig.  5 c, which has desirable characteristics such as very small electron-intercepting area and an exclusive usage of conducting materials (Nagayama  2008 ).

 Another type of material-less phase plate which was proposed recently is the anamorphotic design (Schröder et al.  2007 ). Figure  5 b shows a schematic of the slit-like phase plate which uses electrostatic fields and must be positioned at an anamorphotic diffraction plane. Such a plane has different magnifications in  x  and  y  directions producing a high aspect ratio stretched diffraction pattern that must be oriented along the slit of the phase plate. The realization of this type of phase plate depends mainly on the ability to produce the anamorphotic plane. It will require complicated multiple multipole optical system, similar to the ones found in Cs and Cc correctors, and has yet to be realized and tested.

    <Abstact>Allostery is a fundamental process by which ligand binding to a protein alters its activity at a distant site. There is considerable evidence that allosteric cooperativity can be communicated by the modulation of protein dynamics without conformational change. The Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP) of Escherichia coli is an important experimental exemplar for entropically driven allostery. Here we discuss recent experimentally supported theoretical analysis that highlights the role of global low-frequency dynamics in allostery in CAP and identify how allostery arises as a natural consequence of changes in global low-frequency protein fluctuations on ligand binding.</Abstact>
    <Body>Introduction Allostery (from the Greek  allos stereos  “other solid”) is the regulation of protein function through the binding of an effector molecule at a site other than the protein’s functional site (Cornish-Bowden  2014 ). Allostery represents a fundamental mechanism that underpins normal and pathological molecular cellular processes (Motlagh et al.  2014 ). Despite its importance as a fundamental principle in biology, a generalizable and atomistic description of allostery is lacking. Early models of allosteric co-operativity were rationalised through the description of distinct protein conformers. In the ‘symmetry model’ (MWC: Monod-Wyman-Changeux model), an equilibrium between two conformational states is perturbed by ligand binding such that all subunits in the oligomeric protein change state in a concerted fashion (Monod et al.  1965 ). In the ‘sequential model’ (KNF: Koshland-Nemethy-Filmer model), a requirement for conformational symmetry is replaced with a strict application of ‘induced-fit’ binding of ligand with distinct protein conformers in the bound and unbound states (Koshland et al.  1966 ). These influential models facilitated the development of a view of allostery dominated by a view that structural change was the underlying mechanism. More recently, however, the direct role of structural fluctuations in allostery has become increasingly apparent. Protein dynamics in allostery A theoretical study of Cooper and Dryden in 1984 was an effective challenge to predominant view of allosteric control through structural change (Cooper and Dryden  1984 ). Their statistical thermodynamic analysis demonstrated that allosteric interaction free energies of the order of several kJ mol −1  could be achieved through ligand induced changes in protein dynamics. Specifically, the dynamic allostery described is achieved primarily through altered entropy and was hypothesised to arise from the transformed frequency and amplitude of protein thermal motion. At its broadest level, the idea that proteins have evolved to take functional advantage of not only the mean conformation but also the inherent thermal fluctuations about this mean was introduced. It was found that root mean square fluctuations around the same average position of only 1 % per atom, when summed over an entire protein, could permit changes to the allosteric free energies purely through alterations in entropy (Cooper and Dryden  1984 ). Numerous recent observations have supported the idea that protein dynamics is linked to evolutionary selection pressures. For example, analysis of a large dataset of protein structures has demonstrated that protein backbone flexibility is well conserved at family and superfamily levels despite the lack of obvious primary sequence similarity (Maguid et al.  2006 ). This conservation was subsequently proposed to arise from a conservation of the lowest frequency global protein motions as identified through a direct comparison of protein pairs (Maguid et al.  2008 ). These studies link well with the hypothesis that the lowest frequency modes are more evolutionarily robust through their link to protein functional motions (Nicolay and Sanejouand  2006 ; Tama and Sanejouand  2001 ). For example, evolutionarily conserved low-frequency deformation lobes have been observed to underpin distinct functions within the small monomeric G-proteins (Raimondi et al.  2010 ). Subsequent theoretical developments have more specifically emphasised the role of ligand-modulated low-frequency global modes of protein dynamics in generating allosteric interaction between distant binding sites (Hawkins and McLeish  2004 ,  2006a ). Following from this theoretical analysis, recent developments in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has revolutionised our experimental capacity to study the role of protein structure, dynamics and thermodynamics in allosteric systems (Manley et al.  2013 ). A particularly valuable development has been the use of relaxation NMR methodologies that use fast internal protein dynamics as a proxy for changes in conformation entropy on ligand binding (Wand  2013 ). It is become clear, therefore, that dynamics has a crucial role to play in allostery. The role of dynamics in allostery in the catabolite activator protein While it was evident that dynamic effects were likely to play an important role in some cases of allostery, there was no direct experimental evidence to suggest that dynamics could be the dominant underpinning mechanism in an allosteric system. Work from the laboratory of Kalodimos in 2006 took advantage of the strongly negatively allosteric regulation of a truncated variant of the Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP) to examine the possibility of dynamics-driven allostery (Popovych et al.  2006 ). CAP is a 210 amino acid homodimeric transcription factor of  Escherichia coli  that binds cAMP generated by adenylyl cyclase in response to the phosphorylated form of Enzyme IIA Glc  (phosphorylated in response to the phosphoenolpyruvate–carbohydrate phosphotransferase system) (Gorke and Stulke  2008 ). CAP consists of two domains per monomer. The N-terminal 138 amino acids represent the ligand-binding domain while the C-terminal portion of the molecule represents the DNA binding domain (Fig.  1 ). A range of elegant NMR studies has shown that conformational entropy via altered backbone and side-chain dynamics is linked to positive allostery between ligand and DNA binding where cAMP binding promotes the interaction with DNA (Tzeng and Kalodimos  2009 ,  2012 ). Negative allostery also exists in native CAP between the cAMP binding sites and is of the order of  K

 1  and  K 
 2  represent the dissociation constants for the first and second cAMP binding events); however,  K 
 2 / K 
 1  ≈ 100 for a CAP variant representing only the first 138 amino acids (the ligand binding domain). This enabled the apo-, single ligand bound, and double ligand bound CAP states to be isolated and analysed by NMR and isothermal calorimetry (ITC) to assess the role of dynamics in allosteric regulation. It was demonstrated that there were minimal changes in protein structure between the single and double liganded proteins. Rather there were distinct changes in protein motions between states and the enhanced negative co-operativity was driven by changes in entropy. Binding of the first molecule of cAMP had little effect on motion in the ps–ns range but activated slow motions (μs–ms range) across both subunits (Popovych et al.  2006 ). Binding of the second molecule of cAMP suppressed both fast and slow motions. The suppression of the μs–ms range motions on binding the second molecule of cAMP represents the entropic penalty that is the source of negative co-operativity and the study overall demonstrated that allostery can arise through a purely dynamic mechanism.

 Normal mode analysis A significant issue arises with understanding the theoretical underpinning of allostery in CAP as a number of hypotheses have been presented to explain the mechanism by which dynamic fluctuations are communicated between allosterically coupled sites in various protein systems. One hypothesis is that ligand binding in an allosterically regulated system alters the structure of the global normal modes and therefore the coupling interaction between allosteric sites. This changes the ensemble of the protein structures, incorporating the allosteric sites, and therefore the free energy of binding (Hilser et al.  2012 ; Liu et al.  2007 ; Motlagh and Hilser  2012 ). An alternative proposal has discussed physically connected pathways of activated or repressed dynamics between allosteric sites (Reynolds et al.  2011 ; Zhuravleva et al.  2012 ; Zhuravleva and Gierasch  2011 ). A third view has proposed that large-scale motion dispersed across the protein, the normal modes, can carry the allosteric signal without a requirement for structural change (Hawkins and McLeish  2004 ,  2006b ,  c ). The normal modes describe the different harmonic vibrational oscillations (typically over damped in the case of the slowest modes) in a protein around a mean minimum energy structure. Normal mode analysis (NMA) represents a major simulation technique to study large-scale motions in proteins (Brooks and Karplus  1983 ; Go et al.  1983 ). NMA typically requires a set of Cartesian co-ordinates from an X-ray determination of protein structure and a force field that describes the interactions between the atoms. The calculation involves first, the minimisation of the conformational potential energy, second, calculation of the “Hessian” matrix from the second derivatives of the potential energy with respect to the mass-weighted atomic co-ordinates and, finally, diagonalisation of the Hessian matrix to yield the eigenvalues and eigenvectors that compose the normal modes. In proteins, the low-frequency modes are typically associated with function through collected motion while the more localized high-frequency modes are spatially localised due to dynamic disorder and are associated with protein disorder (Bahar et al.  1998 ). NMA of an all-atom protein structure represents a significant computational problem, particularly due to the long time scales required for a full analysis of the motions associated with the low-frequency modes. One approach to circumvent this problem is the use of elastic network models (ENM) in which the total number of atoms in the protein is reduced to only Cα atoms connected by a network of elastic Hookean springs (Tirion  1996 ). ENM-based models reproduce low-frequency modes that compare well with experimentally derived data (Delarue and Sanejouand  2002 ; Valadie et al.  2003 ). Numerous software packages now permit the calculation of ENMs including elNémo, PDBMAT, ProDy and MAVEN (Bakan et al.  2011 ; Suhre and Sanejouand  2004 ; Tirion  1996 ; Zimmermann et al.  2011 ). Coarse-grained models can therefore provide a reasonably accurate calculation of dynamics over the long time scales required. A very coarse-grained normal mode analysis of internal monomer modes coupled across a dimer interface was able to confirm qualitatively that a fluctuation–allostery model was capable of capturing the negative cooperativity between the two cAMP binding sites of CAP. An increase in internal entropy on the first and a decrease on the second binding event is possible even when identical local changes occur (Toncrova and McLeish  2010 ). The normal modes in dynamic allostery in CAP Rodgers et al. ( 2013a ,  b ) explored in more detail the suggestion that modulation of the normal modes of protein motion was the underpinning molecular mechanism that described dynamic allostery in CAP. The authors therefore applied coarse-grained modelling through ENMs to investigate the entropic contribution of cAMP binding to allostery in CAP. The allosteric free energy for binding the second molecule of cAMP in the calculated ENM was remarkably similar to experimentally obtained values, indicating that the normal modes could successfully recapitulate allostery in CAP. The value of  K 
 2 / K 
 1  (where  K 
 2 / K 
 1  represents the ratio of the second to first dissociation constants for cAMP) obtained for independent wild-type ENMs ( K 
 2 / K 
 1  = 1.35) was similar to that obtained experimentally through isothermal titration calorimetry ( K 
 2 / K 
 1  = 1.68 ± 0.04 SEM,  n  = 32). The value of  K 
 2 / K 
 1  was independent of spring strength and mode frequency. For example, varying uniform spring strength throughout the ENM eight-fold gave only an approximately 1.5 % change in  K 
 2 / K 
 1  (Table  1 ). A spring distance cut-off (8 Å) was selected that gave an optimal correlation value for B factors between the calculated ENM and the CAP crystal structure, despite the fact that a poorer correlation associated with higher values for  K 
 2 / K 
 1  (Table  2 ). Cut-off values at 7.5 Å and less gave calculated models with the atoms improperly connected. The ENM therefore captures negative allostery in CAP. The value of  K 
 2 / K 
 1  reported for the ENM was derived from where values of  K 
 2 / K 
 1  converged with increasing mode number (typically over 75 modes). Analysis of the cumulative protein motion in the CAP ENM reveals that the first 75 modes represent approximately 90 % of the total motion within the model (Fig.  2 ). The allostery captured by the ENM is therefore represented by the lower-frequency modes that represent the majority of the motion in CAP. Further, an analysis of just the first 25 modes, representing 78 % of the total protein motion, within 16 ENMs derived from independent X-ray CAP structures is still able of capturing a significant degree of negative allostery ( K 
 2 / K 
 1  = 1.13 ± 0.01). Figure  3  shows the entropy of the first 25 modes in such a CAP ENM, and reveals the source of the negative allostery. The binding of the first molecule of cAMP ( holo 1-CAP) to unliganded CAP ( apo -CAP) results in an increase in entropy. Binding of the second molecule of cAMP ( holo 2-CAP) shows an enhanced unfavourable entropy change and represents the source of negative allostery. It is of note that the relative entropy increase on binding the second molecule of cAMP is a cumulative effect over the whole 25 modes examined and is not due to a change in one or two dominating modes. An examination of the similarities between eigenvectors further supports the finding that cAMP binding causes generic changes to motion in CAP (Fig.  4 ). A comparison of both  apo -CAP/ holo 1-CAP and  holo 1-CAP/ holo 2-CAP shows that the lowest frequency modes, which typically represent motions of the DNA binding domain, are unaltered albeit slightly re-ordered. In contrast, the higher modes are directly altered in form, demonstrating that cAMP binding generically alters motion within CAP and supporting the observations of entropy increases per mode of Fig.  3 .

 The ENM therefore provides significant insight into the mechanism through which allostery in CAP arises through alterations to the normal modes. Allostery in the CAP homodimer is explained, through contributions to binding entropy, if there are correlations in the low frequency motions between CAP monomers and ligand binding modifies this correlation (Balabin et al.  2009 ). The modulation of these correlated motions within the ENM can be further investigated. Figure  5  shows an analysis of correlated motions within ENMs for  apo -CAP,  holo 1-CAP, and  holo 2-CAP. Binding of both the first and second molecules of cAMP influences correlated motions throughout CAP. A particular significant change of relevance to cooperativity in CAP is that binding of the second molecule of cAMP not only enhances the degree of correlated motion within the ligand binding domain of the second CAP monomer (see black box in Fig.  5 ) but also enhances the degree of correlated motion between opposing ligand binding domains, particularly at the dimer interface (see green box in Fig.  5 ).

 A mutational map for dynamic control of allostery in CAP Changes to the force constants that control the connectivity within the CAP ENM could be reasonably expected to influence the changes in correlated motion and total entropy, and thus allostery, on cAMP binding. At the level of the ENM altered amino acid side chain interactions are modelled by altered spring strengths between the corresponding Cα and its neighbours. As the ENM is a computationally efficient method for calculating ΔΔ G , it was possible to vary the elastic force constant at every Cα atom in turn and calculate the effect on allosteric connectivity. At each site, the spring constant ( k 
 R / k ; corresponds to  k 
 amino acid number /relative spring strength and  k 
 R / k  = 1 throughout the wild-type ENM where the initial model used uniform spring constants) could be increased (to represent a strengthened side chain interaction) or decreased (to represent a weakened side chain interaction) and ΔΔ G  calculated. The resulting allosteric map, a two-dimensional colour-coded surface that related  k 
 R / k  for every amino acid to  K 
 2 / K 
 1 , could reveal features of the protein that exerted control over allostery (Fig.  6 ). A cursory examination of Fig.  6  reveals that residues that exert an influence over allostery in CAP are distributed over the entire CAP monomer but also with a tendency to form clusters (e.g. at the dimer interface). This gives the appearance of “control at a distance” whereby modifications in the ENM modulate allostery through changes in binding entropy through a global change in the normal modes. It is possible to think of these controlling residues operating as a “second order” allosteric interaction; they control, at a distance, the strength of an existing allosteric interaction between two other sites.

 A key feature of the ENM for CAP and the insight obtained into the role of low frequency global motions in allostery is that it enables clear predictions for experimental validation. The global allosteric control map for the ENM (Fig.  6 ) enabled the selection of allosteric control residues for further testing through the introduction of mutations into the CAP protein and an assessment of allostery by isothermal calorimetry (ITC). Isothermal calorimetry represents a standard experimental tool for the experimental assessment of the thermodynamics of protein ligand interactions that directly calculates  K 
 a , Δ H , and binding stoichiometry and subsequently Δ G  and Δ S  from the Gibb’s equation (Brown  2009 ). Rodgers et al.  2013b  selected amino acids for experimental analysis using a range of criteria: Amino acids were selected that could enable both strengthening and weakening of interactions at a single site through altered hydrophobic interactions or at sites where electrostatic interactions could be altered without any adverse influence on local side-chain bulk. Sites were selected at both key control hotspots (e.g. at the central helix) and away from any presumed direct spatial trajectory between cAMP binding sites. Sufficient sites were selected such that observed correlations between experimental and theoretical data were unlikely to have arisen by chance. 
 Sites at the CAP dimer interface (V132) and on a surface loop distant from both the cAMP binding site and the dimer interface (H160) that were predicted to modulate allostery on side-chain mutation. An additional site (V140) was selected as it was predicted to have no influence on allosteric control. It was observed that mutations predicted through the ENM to increase the extent of negative co-operativity (V132A), decrease the extent of negative co-operativity (H160L), or switch allostery in CAP from negative to positive co-operativity (V132L), all behaved as expected when analysed experimentally. In each case, there was a semi-quantitative relationship between the degree of change in  K 
 2 / K 
 1  predicted by the ENM (Fig.  6 ) and that observed experimentally. X-ray structure analysis of all protein variants demonstrated that this rational engineering of altered allostery occurred in the absence of any significant change in overall protein structure. At the predicted V140 neutral site, a V140L mutant behaved as predicted by the ENM with no significant change in  K 
 2 / K 
 1 . The V140A mutation caused a side-chain rotation of C179 to generate a new contact as shown by crystal structure analysis. Experimental findings for V140A were as predicted when this contact was strengthened in the ENM calculations. To summarize, therefore, all mutations tested qualitatively matched the predictions made by the ENM and included even a controlled change in the sign of allostery from a negatively to a positively allosteric protein. These findings were further extended by an analysis of the CRP/FNR transcription factor family member GlxR of  Corynebacterium glutamicum . The role of the normal modes in the control of allostery in CAP was also observed to hold true in GlxR and was supported experimentally (Rodgers et al.  2013b ; Townsend et al.  2014 ). A subset of amino acids in CAP is therefore predicted to exert control over allostery and the data for several of these are experimentally supported. This allowed a test of the hypothesis that amino acids that exert control over allostery would be more invariant in related proteins from different species, presuming that allostery confers a selective advantage on the organism. Such an analysis is complicated as different but overlapping subsets of amino acids might confer a selective advantage for their contribution to ligand binding and the mean structure, in addition to allosteric control. Notwithstanding this caveat, an examination of 163 CAP variants from diverse bacterial species demonstrated that the rate at which an amino acid mutates was negatively correlated with  K 
 2 / K 
 1 . Residues that contribute to low-frequency fluctuations in CAP-like proteins are therefore linked to evolutionary selection pressures. Global protein properties for dynamic control of allostery The theoretical analysis of allostery in CAP discussed here is suggestive of general underlying biophysical principles that permit allostery. The route taken to understand these principles has been one of  simplifying  the CAP protein for analysis (i.e. through the use of the ENM) rather than attempting to isolate such principles from fully atomistic representations of the protein. This approach can be carried further by coarse-graining CAP into a rotational-translational block representation (Durand et al.  1994 ). In such a representation, CAP is modelled as two coarse-grained blocks per monomer (one for the cAMP-binding domain and one for the DNA-binding domain) (Fig.  7a ). Each individual block is rigid in this model, with internal residues fixed in relation to one another but with an integrated coupling strength. The blocks are connected to their neighbours by the remaining springs of the ENM (Fig.  7b ). The rigid blocks are permitted one internal breathing motion and are permitted to move relative to each other. The justification for this approximation is the observed large degree of elastic inhomogeneity within and between the blocks. Remarkably, negative allostery can even be captured in such a super-coarse-grained model system for CAP ( K 
 2 / K 
 1  = 1.08) (McLeish et al.  2013 ). The actual position of wild-type CAP, or its variants, represent single points on a larger allosteric free energy landscape, and the position of any CAP variant is predominantly determined at this level of coarse-graining by changes to the coupling strength within the ligand-binding domain ( k 
 1 ) and between monomers ( k 
 12 ). (Fig.  7c ). Fig. 7 A super-coarse-grained models for CAP.  a  The elastic block representation for CAP that emerges from constraining all residues whose relative spatial fluctuations are less than 3 Å into a single rigid domain.  b  The corresponding model in which each block is accorded a single internal mode. For the super-coarse-grained CAP dimer, the internal subunit coupling strengths are characterized by  k 
 1  though  k 
 4  and the intersubunit couplings by  k 
 12 ,  k 
 13 , and  k 
 24.  Coupling strengths were defined by principal component analysis of 300-ns simulations for the no ligand, single ligand, and double ligand bound states.  c  Allosteric free energy in CAP as a function of the reduced two-dimensional landscape derived from the effective internal elastic strength within the cAMP binding domain ( k 
 1 ) and the inter-dimer elastic strength ( k 
 12 ) of the super-coarse-grained model. Figure taken from Rodgers et al. ( 2013b ) 
 The description of negative allostery in a super-coarse grained model for CAP raises an even more fundamental question. What are the required properties of a protein that can permit low-frequency dynamics controlled allostery to arise? McLeish and co-authors performed a series of calculations to exemplify the fundamental properties of fluctuation-induced allostery (McLeish et al.  2013 ). While this approach does not serve to illustrate any particular protein per se, it does function to identify key biophysical requirements that must be fulfilled to permit allostery to occur. The highly coarse-grained “toy” systems analysed revealed that a key requirement for fluctuation-induced allostery to occur is an inhomogenous elastic density in the system. In a protein, such elastic inhomogeneity can arise through both relatively rigid and less rigid regions within the internal environment of the protein and also through the boundary geometry of the folded protein (as observed at a simple level in the super-coarse-grained model for CAP). Significantly, dynamically induced allostery that operates through modulation of the normal modes has the potential for being either positive or negative in sign so long as there is at least two coupled degrees of freedom within the system. This theory therefore suggests that the requirements for an appropriately tuned internal elastic architecture that supports the functional requirements for allostery in a protein can co-exist with the structural requirements that underpin other aspects of protein function. Conclusions The CAP protein of  E. coli  has served as an excellent exemplar to demonstrate how thermal excitation of biomolecular normal modes can underpin allosteric cooperativity. Analysis of the theoretical framework for allostery in this model has allowed both the rational engineering of allostery and the identification of fundamental protein properties that permit control of allostery through the normal modes. CAP represents a case of dynamic allostery that can be altered through changes to entropy. There are several challenges for the future, among them the exploration of how general is the arising of specific ‘control sites’ of allosteric cooperativity, the witness of the evolutionary record, the exploration of the effects of multiple mutations, and the contribution of the normal modes to allosteric systems that are also characterised by conformational change. </Body>

    <Body>The 5th Asia Pacific Protein Association Conference and 12th International Symposium of the Protein Society of Thailand (APPA/PST2017) was held at The Tide Resort, Bangsaen, Chonburi, Thailand, from the 11th to the 14th of July, 2017 (Fig.  1 ). It was hosted by the Protein Society of Thailand, Chulabhorn Research Institute, and Burapha University, in honor of the 60th birthday of Professor Dr. H.R.H. Chulabhorn Mahidol, the President of the Chulabhorn Research Institute, and a prolific contributor to chemical and biomedical research, as well as related social issues.

 The Asia Pacific Protein Association (APPA;  http://www.pssj.jp/APPA/about/overview/ ) grew from the Pacific Rim International Conference on Protein Structure (PRICPS), which was first held in Yokohama, Japan, in 2004. After that outstanding meeting, the organizers endeavored to continue in its tradition to organize the 2nd PRICPS in Cairns, Australia, in 2008 in conjunction with the Asia Oceania Human Proteome Organization (AOHUPO) Congress. At that meeting, the Asia Pacific Protein Association was formed, with the main purpose of organizing protein structure and function in the Asia Pacific region, in order to promote the development of protein science and collaboration. Subsequently, the 3rd APPA Conference was held in Shanghai, China, in 2011, and the 4th APPA Conference in Jeju, Korea, in 2014, followed by this, the 5th in this series. The Protein Society of Thailand (PST;  www.proteinsocthai.net ) originated from similar goals to build a network of scientists working on proteins and to provide a forum for them to exchange their research and ideas. This network developed into the society known at the PST, which has held the conference series now called the International Symposium of the PST since 2006, at which international and local invited speakers, including senior scientists and notable young scientists, share their work in English to promote international interactions. The APPA/PST2017 meeting included 7 plenary lectures, led by Thomas Steitz, who regaled the assembled group of 400 participants with his description of the ribosome structure and the use of bacterial ribosome structures in designing improved antibiotics (Fig.  1 ). In the second plenary, M.R. Jisnuson Svasti described the development of protein science in Thailand using illustrations from his own career. This was followed by the EMBO Keynote Lecture by Madan Babu, in which he described the importance of intrinsically disordered proteins and protein regions at a proteome- and genome-wide level. In his plenary, So Iwata described the use of the free electron laser to gain temporal insight into light-initiated reactions in bacterial rhodopsin and the photosystem II oxygen-evolving complex, while Ruiming Xu considered the structural basis of epigenetics, particularly histone acetylation and deacetylation. In the penultimate plenary, Akhilesh Pandey explored the identification and validation of protein–protein interactions in cells as the current frontier in proteomics. Carol B. Post presented the final plenary, “The Protein Society Keynote Lecture,” in which she described an unusual mechanism for regulation of protein–protein interactions by phosphorylation in Syk tyrosine kinase. Interspersed among the plenary lectures were 43 invited and 25 selected oral lectures, divided into 17 parallel sessions. These sessions focused on diverse areas of protein research, from advances in proteomics, systems biology and bioinformatics to structural investigations of protein–nucleic acid interactions and molecular processes, enzyme catalysis, dynamics of protein–protein interactions and signaling, as well as protein engineering to achieve new protein activities. Outstanding scientists from around the Asia Pacific region, together with Prof. Joan Steitz from the USA, were featured as invited speakers (Table  1 ). An 18th session honoring the 70th birthday of Prof. M.R. Jisnuson Svasti featured outstanding Thai protein scientists who have worked with Prof. Svasti during the development of their careers. Furthermore, a Systems Biology and Computational Biology Workshop, in which senior and local scientists shared their experiences and discussed their research and related issues, was included in the afternoon parallel sessions of 12th July, while the Synchrotron Light Research Institute (SLRI) sponsored a workshop on Synchrotron Protein Research in the afternoon of 13th July to introduce researchers to the facilities available at the SLRI in Thailand, as well as in the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC), Taiwan, China, and the SPring-8 facilities in Japan.

 In addition to the lectures, 5 poster sessions allowed participants ample time to discuss the excellent work of young and a few senior scientists presenting in these sessions. Luncheon lectures from Bio-Rad, GE and Merck introduced participants to ways of collaborating with the companies, along with some of the latest technologies available from these companies, while other companies presented their products in the exhibition. Several young scientists also took advantage of the Young Scientist Program held just ahead of the conference (9th to 11th July) to learn from senior protein researchers and present their own research in short talks. In short, the APPA/PST2017 conference provided an exciting forum for protein science, with some of the world’s top protein scientists sharing their research results, with particular emphasis on research from the Asia Pacific region. The high quality of the research presented bodes well for the future meetings of the APPA, including the 6th APPA Conference to be held in Sapporo, Japan, in July, 2020, in collaboration with the Protein Science Society of Japan and the Protein Society. </Body>

    <Title>Biophysical Reviews: a Q1 ranked journal in biophysics and structural biology</Title>
    <Doi>10.1007/s12551-020-00764-8</Doi>
    <Authors>Hall Damien</Authors>
    <Abstact>This Editorial for Biophysical Reviews (Volume 12, Issue 5) begins with a description of the two feature articles. The first being the latest in the “Meet the Editors Series” describing Rosangela Itri—the Biophysical Reviews Executive Editor responsible for the South American region. The second feature article is by Alexandra Zidovska, the inaugural winner of the 2020 “Michèle Auger Award for Young Scientists’ Independent Research.” Next highlighted are the Issue contents, which consist of five Commentaries/Letters and eleven Reviews. Finally, we conclude with a description of Biophysical Reviews’ ascension within the world’s major journal rankings index (Elsevier, Scimago)—becoming 12th overall (out of 156) within the biophysics category and receiving the coveted Q1 rating in both biophysics and structural biology sections.</Abstact>
    <Body>Due to the emergence of COVID-19, 2020 will undoubtedly be remembered as an  annus horribilis  by many, if not all. Despite the difficulties imposed by the pandemic, 2020 has, nevertheless, turned out to be an exceedingly productive year for  Biophysical Reviews . 1  To date, the journal has published two Special Issues (Komatsuzaki et al.  2020 ; dos Remedios  2020 2 ) and two regular Issues (Hall  2020a ,  c ). In addition to receiving an increased number of submissions (both invited and unsolicited), the journal has also undertaken a number of special initiatives in 2020. One such initiative is the “Meet the Editors Series”. This series has so far provided interesting insights into both the human and scientific sides of the journal’s senior group of Executive Editors (Olson  2020 ; Nagayama  2020 ; Jagannathan  2020 ; Ho  2020 ). This Issue’s first article (Itri  2020 ) extends this grouping, with a short scientific autobiography of the Executive Editor for South America—Prof. Rosangela Itri. A specialist in solution scattering, Rosangela is Professor within the Institute for Physics at Sao Paolo University and a core member of the growing Brazilian synchrotron facility. As described (Itri  2020 ), Rosangela’s main topic of research is the study of protein–membrane interactions using the small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) technique. What can also be garnered from this piece is Rosangela’s sustained commitment to the international promotion of biophysics as a necessary and important sub-discipline. A second major new undertaking carried out by  Biophysical Reviews  has been the establishment and running of a competition to honor the life and legacy of Prof. Michèle Auger—a much admired Editorial Board Member who sadly lost her battle with illness in late 2018 (IUPAB  2019 ). First announced in 2019, the “Michèle Auger Award for Young Scientists’ Independent Research” was created to act as a perpetual memorial to Michèle’s life and service. As described in the original announcement call for 2019 (Hall  2019a ) 3 , the “Michèle Auger Award for Young Scientists’ Independent Research” is to be granted each year to a single candidate performing biophysical research, who at the time of application is under 40 years of age. The award will consist of a plaque and a free personal subscription to the journal along with an invitation to submit a single author editorial review article to  Biophysical Reviews . The published editorial review will carry a short foreword about the life of Prof. Michèle Auger, along with her work associated with teaching and training the next generation of biophysical scientists. Nominations can be made in the form of a candidate’s one-page curriculum vitae, along with five original manuscripts, to be submitted by email to either the Chief Editor, or any one of the  Biophysical Review ’s Executive Editors, prior to October 31. Judging will be carried out by a special committee assembled from the Editorial Board, with this assembly taking place after the submission deadline. The winner will be announced in December, with the winner’s single author editorial review to be published in the following year. The inaugural winner of the Michèle Auger Award for Young Scientists’ Independent Research (2020) is Assistant Professor Alexandra Zidovska from the Department of Physics at New York University (Zidovska  2020 ). As part of the award for 2020, Alexandra has contributed a review article describing her research work on the optical microscopy–based examination of the rheology of the cell cytoplasm. The two separate forewords at the start of Alexandra’s review article respectively provide information on both the scientific legacy of Prof. Michèle Auger and Alexandra’s own scientific path (Zidovska  2020 ). Figure  1  both shows Alexandra receiving her award 4  and also a graph providing some idea of the stiffness of this year’s competition. 5  Nominations for the 2021 award are open until October 31 of 2020. As a way of both remembering Prof. Michèle Auger’s association with the journal and acknowledging her efforts in promoting the careers of young and talented researchers, interested readers are encouraged to nominate a young scientist they believe to be deserving.

Alexandra’s Review is the feature article of the current Issue (Zidovska  2020 ).  b  Ordinal ranking of nominated entrants showing average scores with standard error. Amongst the approximately thirty nominations for the 2020 competition, the judging was quite tight. Each entrant was assessed by a minimum of eight members of a judging panel composed of fifteen distinguished biophysicists. The ranking scale was relative to the candidate pool (with even the lowest ranked candidates being considered as exceptional by the judges) Commentaries and letters Immediately following the two feature articles are a mixed set of five Commentaries and Letters. The first two articles are requested Commentaries from young scientists placed amongst the top ten runners-up of this year’s Michèle Auger Award, namely Assistant Professor Allison Squires (Squires  2020 ) and Assistant Professor Antonio Benedetto (Benedetto  2020 ). Writing about their own lives and research, both authors describe their own scientific fields and individual career progression. Allison’s interests are in nanoscale biophysics–based single-molecule measurement and manipulation (Squires  2020 ). Antonio’s interests lie in the study of the solvation of proteins and membranes in various liquids (ranging from aqueous systems to more exotic ionic liquids) (Benedetto  2020 ). The obvious research strengths of these two participants from the Michèle Auger Award indicate the remarkably high quality of all the entrants in this year’s competition. The next three articles in the current Issue are Letters. 6  The first such Letter by Kundu et al. ( 2020 ) describes current thoughts about the evolutionary origins of the cell membrane, termed a “protocell,” that allowed for the encapsulation and creation of the unit cell—the fundamental quantum of life. On the basis of well-reviewed supporting literature, the authors discuss the hypothesis that the best candidate constituents for these early protocell vesicles were relatively short-chained fatty acids (Kundu et al.  2020 ). The authors argue in favor of this protocell origin due to the relative porosity of membranes formed from short-chained fatty acids and their tendency to undergo spontaneous fission (Kundu et al.  2020 ). In addition to describing evidence supporting their hypothesis, the authors also advance a series of necessary experiments required to test their protocell argument. The second Letter (Hossein  2020 ) provides a remarkably compact introduction to the Zika virus, describing its history, molecular composition, structural biology, and medical impact. The author concludes with a critique of current methods for detecting Zika virus using antibody-based methods, describing the problems that these methods face due to intrinsic cross-reactivity with other collocated endemic viruses of the family Flaviviridae (such as Dengue virus) (Hossein  2020 ). The third Letter published within this Issue is a submission from a medical doctor with a background in physics, who investigates mechanisms of ultra-violet radiation promotion of skin cancer (Kanellis  2020 ). In this Letter, Dr. Kanellis describes the current state of the art in medical measurement devices for determining abnormal (disease-related) melanin content in various skin types (Kanellis  2020 ). Review articles As a regular Issue, the articles described here share no common thematic link and therefore provide a remarkably diverse showcase of modern biophysical research. Given the current circumstances, the first review article by Kiss et al. ( 2020 ), on the topic of single molecule–based methods for the biophysical investigations of viruses, is particularly topical. In a cogently written piece, the authors describe the advantages of single-molecule techniques, such as optical tweezers, atomic force microscopy, and various super-resolution fluorescence microscopy methods, with regard to the experimental extraction of non-ensemble averaged distribution information that is capable of providing a rich information stream relating to viral dynamics and structure (Kiss et al.  2020 ). The second contributed Review (Furusawa and Irie  2020 ) initially examines metrological frameworks for quantifying both phenotypic and genomic changes. Acknowledging that most evolutionary change is necessarily constrained in some way, the authors review suitable methods for modeling change adapted from statistical physics–based fluctuation–response theorems of constrained systems. Via a careful synthesis, this thought-provoking article helps to frame the question of what factors act as constraints in the evolutionary process (Furusawa and Irie  2020 ). Sharma and Jagannathan ( 2020 ) have contributed the third review article on the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for the identification of chemical composition changes occurring within prostate cancer (PCa) tissue. Exploiting the ability of NMR methods to both quantitatively measure and identify the individual molecules present within tissue, the authors review chemoinformatics-based ratiometric analytical approaches for generating diagnostic and prognostic tools based on the ratio of particular metabolites that are differentially over- or under-produced in cancerous tissue as compared with healthy tissue (or indeed in other recoverable biosamples, such as blood, urine, or semen). The authors also present the latest uses of solid-state NMR techniques in the analysis of prepared histopathology samples. The fourth contributed Review (Pandey and Ramakrishnan  2020 ) examines a range of strategies for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, covering both the latest in pharmaceutical approaches and recent efforts made in the development of non-invasive therapies based on the use of light and ultrasound along with trans-cranial magnetic and electric stimulation (Pandey and Ramakrishnan  2020 ). Reviewing material outside the standard pharmaceutical arena, Gauvey and Pandey provide a fresh look at a less frequently contemplated modality for approaching this very serious problem. Kumari et al. ( 2020 ) have contributed the fifth review article on the topic of deleterious ionic liquid–biological interactions occurring at the cellular and tissue levels of complexity. Following on from the same group’s earlier contributed review article, that examined the solvation properties of ionic liquids with biomolecular components such as proteins and phospholipid membranes (Benedetto  2017 ), this Review discusses the question of ionic liquid cytotoxicity (Benedetto  2017 ). Given the many advantageous properties of ionic liquids for the potential “tuning” of chemical reactions occurring in hybrid synthetic and biosynthetic reaction design, the problems discussed by Kumari et al. ( 2020 ) will be important for harnessing the power of chemical biology in the coming decades. The sixth Review, contributed by Chiliza et al. ( 2020 ), is a collaborative effort between groups from South Africa and Chile. The subject concerns the mechanism of action of the redox reaction carried out by Cytochrome p450 mono-oxygenase (CP450-MO). As noted by the authors, the principal reaction catalyzed by the CP450-MO enzyme is the insertion of one atom of oxygen into the aliphatic position of an organic substrate, with the other oxygen atom being reduced to water with the oxidized substrate typically becoming more water soluble. 7  This redox reaction necessarily requires a source of electrons, and it is the exact source of these required electrons that helps to differentiate the various classes of CP450-MO existing in nature. In their Review, Chiliza et al. ( 2020 ) describe the structural pre-requisites for successful protein–protein docking, interaction, and electron transfer, between class I CP450-MOs and their protein-based electron donor, ferredoxin—which constitutes its own class of soluble iron–sulfur (Fe-S) cluster proteins. This detailed article provides important information necessary for those wishing to understand the biological mechanism of electron transfer as well as those wishing to use protein engineering methods for the de novo bioengineering of new electron transport pathways (Chiliza et al.  2020 ). The next Review, which stems from a collaboration between research groups in Pakistan and Malaysia (Rahim et al.  2020 ), discusses biophysical aspects of the use of novel nano-biopolymers as the loadable and implantable agents in controlled drug release experiments. In their review article, the authors discuss the effects of nano-dimensional shaping of the polymer, suitable materials for nano-biopolymers, methods of synthesis, and toxicity aspects associated with the use of these new biomaterials. The authors conclude their Review with a summary of open questions which need to be answered for further progress in this field (Rahim et al.  2020 ). The eighth review article is a lone author piece submitted by Assist. Prof. Ahammad (located at the North South University in Bangladesh) that details the structure and function of the family of Semaphorin proteins (Ahammad  2020 ). Placing the Review’s focus on the various roles that different members of the Semaphorin family play in either promoting, or inhibiting cancer growth, Assist. Prof. Ahammad highlights the potential of this family of proteins as future anti-cancer drug targets (Ahammad  2020 ). Beg and Khan ( 2020 ) have contributed the tenth review article which deals with the subject of the nature of the protein structural motifs and constituent interfacial amino acid residues that either promote or retard the one-dimensional protein homo-polymerization reaction known as amyloid formation. Placing their focus in vivo, the authors take a wide view of amyloid promotion and inhibition by looking at how these factors (and other related factors such as post-translational modifications) affect amyloid formation by examining their role as determinants of intracellular transport, enzymatic processing, and cleavage in addition to their biophysical role in mediating the polymerization reaction. This wider view is undoubtedly the more biologically relevant for determination of the biodynamics operative at the organism level (Beg and Khan  2020 ). The final Review of Issue 5 is a three-way collaboration between the United Kingdom, Pakistan, and the United States (Yusuf et al.  2020 ). This Review presents a historical perspective of the development and usage of cryo-preservation techniques in chromosome sample preparation prior to investigation using various forms of nano-microscopy. Describing both traditional approaches, such as the use of cryo-preparation of the sample with transmission electron microscopy, as well as ultra-modern methodology, involving the use of cryo-preparation in conjunction with atomic force microscopy (AFM), cryo-electron tomography, and super-resolution fluorescence microscopies, the Review article details how cryo-techniques have helped to advance our knowledge of chromosomal packing from the basic chromatin unit level to the consideration of the torsional dynamics associated with fully condensed mitotic chromosome (Yusuf et al.  2020 ). Release of 2019 Scimago rankings In August of 2020, the latest journal rankings list was released by Elsevier, one of the world’s largest scientific publishers. Undoubtedly, when used in a lazy fashion, journal metrics may prevent scientific articles from being judged on their individual merits, with assignation of relative plaudits or criticism instead based on their association with a particular journal (rather than the article’s scientific content). Nevertheless, it would be naïve to believe that journal metrics do not drive much of the modern scientific enterprise. Indeed, grant panels along with hiring and tenure committees, are frequently dominated by questions such as “where was it published?” rather than “what was it about?” or “does it make scientific sense?” Acknowledging such modern peculiarities associated with journal rankings (and with these comments provided as caveat emptor) we announce with muted pride  Biophysical Reviews ’ emergence as one of the top rated journals in the latest round of the Scimago™ rankings (Scimago  2020a ,  b ). With the conferral of a first quartile (Q1) ranking in both the biophysics and structural biology categories and the recognition of an average number of citations per document over 2 years as 4.91,  Biophysical Reviews  has emerged as the 12th ranked journal overall in the category of biophysics, much improved from its previous ordinal ranking of 40. Some of the journals success has been due to its push into the social media realm. Largely based around the free online sharing tool promoted by the journal, known as the SharedIt™ initiative (Hall  2017 ,  2019a ,  b ), the journal operates a YouTube™ channel and a Twitter™ account that act to highlight the articles published by the journal by providing authors with an ultra-modern means to peruse, share, and access content. These two social media platforms can be accessed at the following web addresses. Biophysical Reviews  YouTube Channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzG_5MWmnrB2UBibtxs2DuA Biophysical Reviews  Twitter Account @BiophysicalRev1 In discussing any improvement in  Biophysical Reviews ’ perceived stature, the journal acknowledges that the principal twin drivers of progress are the very many excellent contributions from our published authors, and the efforts of the reviewers of the manuscripts who have invested their time in critiquing and improving the submitted articles. As the journal operates predominantly on an invitation to publish basis, the continued success of the journal stems from the activity of Editorial Board Members.Their discerning invitations of review articles from as wide an array of countries as possible helps to distinguish  Biophysical Reviews  as a true international venue for publishing biophysics-related content. Building on the efforts of Jean Garnier (2009) and Cristobal dos Remedios (dos Remedios  2016 ), the Editorial Board has worked with philanthropic spirit to further the aspirations of our parent body IUPAB—the International Union for Pure and Applied Biophysics—the world’s governing body for the promotion and encouragement of biophysical research. Concluding remarks Prospective authors interested in submitting a review article to  Biophysical Reviews  are encouraged to first broach the matter with either the Chief Editor or their local Executive or Editorial Board Member. After discussion on the suitability of their article, a timetable for their submission will be arranged in conjunction with the professional officers of the journal. </Body>

    <Abstact>This Editorial first describes the articles constituting the current Issue (Volume 12 Issue 3). It then goes on to outline the formal invitation procedure for those interested in submitting a review article to the journal. The Editorial concludes by describing the nomination process for the 2021 Michèle Auger Award for Young Scientists’ Independent Research.</Abstact>
    <Body>At the time of writing, the world is in the grips of the COVID-19 pandemic. Derived from a conjunction of the two Greek words “pan” (meaning all) and “demos” (meaning the people), the literal implication of a pandemic is a phenomenon affecting all people. Although the disease prevalence is differentially manifested, no populated region has been left untouched. By far, the majority of Biophysical Reviews’ audience are working research scientists, engineers, and medical professionals. Another significant constituency are the undergraduate and graduate students working towards higher qualifications within these same fields. To those directly affected by illness to either themselves, or a loved one, the journal extends its sympathies and best wishes for a speedy return to health. To those not directly affected, we appreciate that you most likely are having to adapt to new social distancing rules with requirements for work/study from home. As experiments are put on hold, it may be easy to lose focus on the importance of our collective research endeavor. However, it is important to remember that it is only through society’s continual investment in basic and applied research that we are able to prepare for societal emergencies (such as COVID-19), as well as provide the knowledge and tools that are (hopefully) used for the improvement of humanity’s lot. Our continued scientific engagement during the current difficult times is vital for the maintenance of the international research enterprise—one of civilization’s sharpest swords in its decision making arsenal. Issue contents Directly following this Editorial is the third installment of our Biophysical Reviews Meet the Editors Series, contributed by Prof. Naranamangalam Jagannathan (Jagannathan  2020 ). Prof. Jagannathan is a medical physicist whose life story will likely inspire younger scientists. In this scientific mini-biography, he details overcoming polio as a child and explains how this early brush with disease was the inspirational spark that launched him into a biomedical career that has seen him become a pioneer developer of several magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diagnostic techniques. In a remarkably honest fashion, he describes the highs and lows along his career trajectory, one that culminated in him leading India’s principal MRI Department at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) located in New Delhi. While some scientific biographies can be a little dry, this contribution (Jagannathan  2020 ), very much like its two predecessors (Olson  2020 ; Nagayama  2020 ), is quite fun to read and remarkably human. Contributed by the members of a European consortium COST Action network (Antonacci et al. 2020), the third article in this Issue reviews the latest developments in Brillouin spectroscopy for the determination of cell mechanical properties. First reported on nearly a century ago (Brillouin  1922 ), Brillouin scattering describes the phenomenon of light scattered from a nonrandom density fluctuation such as that caused by a traveling pressure (sound) wave. As the speed of sound in a medium is related to its mechanical properties, recording the shift in frequency of the scattered light in relation to the strength and direction of the applied acoustic pulse provides sufficient information for evaluation of localized viscoelasticity of the medium. Antonacci et al. ( 2020 ) review recent examples of how the Brillouin scattering phenomenon can be applied in microscopy format to interrogate and define sub-micrometer length scale mechanical heterogeneities in cultured cells. This review article potentially presages Brillouin microscopy as the next major cell imaging modality. Arising from an international collaboration between scientists form Poland, Australia, and the Netherlands, the next article (Zapotoczny et al.  2020 ) reviews the truly fascinating subject of fenestrae, specialized import/export pores found within liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. Existing at the interface of the liver tissue and its blood transporting microvasculature, liver sinusoidal endothelium is a cellular monolayer that regulates exchange of nutrients between the liver and blood. Specific to the liver endothelium, fenestrae are membrane enclosed tubular pores that extend across the cell from the apical to basolateral membranes. Zapotoczny et al. ( 2020 ) review the dynamic nature of the formation, loss, and spatial localization of these 50–350-nm diameter pores concentrating on data gained using high speed or “4D” atomic force microscopy (AFM). The next article by Yanaka et al. ( 2020 ) reviews the use of computational and structural methods to report on dynamic aspects of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) type antibody. Describing studies of IgG structure based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), AFM, small-angle X-ray scattering, and cryo-electron microscopy, this Review provides an excellent primer on recent IgG structural literature. Going beyond facile static lock and key type conceptualizations of the antibody variable region protein interface binding to its antigenic epitope, this Review highlights the role of intrinsic conformational heterogeneity (and the dynamics of transition between these states) in the action of both IgG binding and non-binding regions. Aside from discussing the plasticity of the IgG recognition event, the authors also review the roles of specific carbohydrate modification of the IgG as well as describing the under-appreciated effects of higher-order oligomerization of the IgG post epitope recognition (Yanaka et al.  2020 ). Although functioning as a stand-alone Review, this piece was a late addition to the Special Issue dedicated to the Biophysical Society of Japan and we encourage the reader to appreciate its contribution in relation to that Issue (Komatsuzaki et al.  2020 ; Hall  2020a ). The sixth contribution to this Issue (Singh et al.  2020 ) is the journal’s first review article contributed from the Jammu and Kashmir region. This article is a collaboration between a team of physicists and medical doctors reviewing the role of spectroscopic methods for the determination of the elemental and molecular composition of gall bladder and kidney stones. Split into three parts, the Review first details the presenting medical features of stone formation and the classification schema used in their diagnosis and pathology. The second part provides a review summary of the physical background to spectroscopic methods applied to stone research such as infra-red/ultra-violet spectroscopy, wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy, and time of flight mass spectrometry. The third aspect of this Review discusses published findings on the composition of gall and kidney stones determined using these spectroscopic methods. By reviewing region-specific tendencies associated with stone composition, the authors note a possible dietary determinant to the etiology of stone formation and presentation (Singh et al.  2020 ). The seventh article in this Issue (Kohata and Miyoshi  2020 ) reviews the topic of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) from the perspective of these separate liquid phase regions playing a role in the storage and regulation of messenger (m), small nuclear (sn), ribosomal (r), and non-coding (nc) RNA chains. Providing a clear walk through the terminology used to define the many and varied RNA containing liquid phase regions (e.g., nucleolus, paraspeckles, nuclear speckles, Cajal bodies, PML bodies, P bodies, stress granules, and germ granules), Kohata and Miyoshi ( 2020 ) review evidence for the anionic polymer characteristics of RNA being a strong instigator of liquid-liquid phase separation when existing in a solution with weakly binding cationic proteins. Unlike the majority of Reviews on this topic, the authors also relate the regulation of RNA-mediated LLPS to a number of common diseases, with one prominent example being amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This article was originally meant to be a part of the Special Issue on the Biophysical Society of Japan 1  and we encourage the reader to revisit the aims and intentions of that Special Issue after reading this Review (Komatsuzaki et al.  2020 ; Hall  2020a ). Discussing literature taken from the “Adaptive Laboratory Evolution” (ALE) systems biology approach, the next review article deals with the subject of quantitative assessment of bacterial evolution (Horinouchi and Furusawa  2020 ). Readers of the journal may be familiar with simple laboratory-based evolution studies in which a single enzyme’s performance is monitored for improvement through cycles of challenge (or induced mutation) and selection. The Review by Horinouchi and Furusawa ( 2020 ) discusses effective next-level quantitative approaches to determining organism fitness. These next-level methods incorporate multiple streams of information relating to genome sequence, transcriptome sequence, and “metabolomic” data into quantitative relations describing phenotypic advantage. Introducing innovations in both laboratory automation and formulation of analytical expressions, this review of the ALE approach signals the quantitative road ahead for identification of molecular pathways and individual components involved in evolutionary adaption. This Review was a late addition to the Special Issue dedicated to the Biophysical Society of Japan and we encourage the reader to appreciate its contribution in relation to that Issue (Komatsuzaki et al.  2020 ; Hall  2020a ). The ninth article within this Issue (Rodin  2020 ) reviews nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methodology for studying water in biopolymers (such as collagen-based gels or complex scaffolds for tissue engineering) and complex biological samples (such as pulped wood or wet soil). After reviewing some basic NMR theory (related to different modes of spin relaxation and pulsed-field gradient methods for measurement of diffusion), the author reviews a series of approaches for measuring the mobility of water and inferring its chemical and physical environment. Concentrating on parameters that can be used as correlative measures of sample quality, or alternatively, measures of sample uniformity, Rodin ( 2020 ) describes both practical examples (such as the assessment of heterogeneity in proton spin-spin (T 2 ) relaxation constants in spruce pine samples) and simulated results (such as correlation analysis of the diagonal components of the diffusion tensor obtained from orthogonal pulse-field gradient diffusion experiments). This Review demonstrates how modern NMR methods can be used to practical advantage in sample characterization. The penultimate contribution, resulting from an international collaboration between scientists from Algeria, India, and Iran, is concerned with the use of quantum dots (QDs) in nanomedicine (Nikazar et al.  2020 ). Essentially spherical semiconductors, the electronic transition between valence and conduction bands in QDs is greatly affected by their nano-scale radius of curvature (in the range of 1–10 nm). This nanoscale aspect of the physics allows them to fluoresce at visible wavelengths, in a manner that can be “tuned” upon changing either the semiconductor material or the size of the quantum dot. Appropriately modified, these QDs are used in nanomedicine for bioimaging and magic bullet therapy, although one major drawback (jointly stemming from their semiconductor composition and high specific surface area to volume ratio) is their significant cytotoxicity. This Review by Nikazar et al. ( 2020 ) reviews a large number of studies for the factors that both produce and mitigate such toxicity. An interesting feature of this Review is its additional examination of toxicity at the environmental level as might be important for the case of QD pollution arising from its indiscriminate release. Second messengers are intracellular signaling molecules released within the cell after membrane receptors bind an extracellular signaling molecule (which constitutes the first messenger). The final article of Issue 3 reviews the multiple signal transduction roles of a ubiquitous bacterial second messenger known as cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) (Petchiappan et al.  2020 ). Among the many roles of c-di-GMP, it regulates the transition between the bacterial swimming “planktonic” stage and the non-motile biofilm growth stage. Aside from describing these and other functional roles, this Review discusses recently developed bioanalytical tools for the quantitative measurement and regulation of c-di-GMP levels within the cell. With a focus on fluorescence methods, the authors describe a series of c-di-GMP biosensors based on c-di-GMP binding riboswitches and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) constructs involving c-di-GMP binding proteins. Petchiappan et al. ( 2020 ) synthesize the available information to present a spatiotemporal picture of c-di-GMP’s sources and sinks within the cell. Engaging with Biophysical Reviews The journal has previously published on the benefits (and disadvantages) of writing a Review (Hall  2019a ). One of the noted negative features of Review preparation was the time spent away from generating primary research results. For many researchers currently coping with the COVID-19 lockdown, this particular negative aspect is no longer present. For those interested in writing a Review, I describe the general process for engaging with Biophysical Reviews with the intention of writing, submitting, publishing, and promoting your review article. (i.) Consultation with an Editorial Board Member : Biophysical Reviews principally operates in an invitation to publish based manner through which review articles are commissioned by Members of the Editorial Board and coordinated for publication within a particular Issue. However, if you have a proposal for an article, you are welcome to make direct contact with the Chief Editor, or alternatively, your local Editorial Board Member. Typically, during this negotiation phase, you will be asked to provide a manuscript title, a prospective list of authors, and a short abstract. A provisional submission date will be agreed upon and the target Issue set upon the condition of the manuscript being accepted after review by two experts in the field (with necessary revisions being satisfactorily completed). (ii.) Receiving an invitation to publish : Once the topic has been judged appropriate for the journal, you will receive an official offer from the commissioning Editorial Board Member asking you to commit to submitting your article by a particular date (agreed upon during the consultation phase). Attached to this email will be two documents, the first summarizing the journal website and submission process, the second an “instructions for authors” detailing necessary referencing formats and figure requirements. This email letter will contain within the cc line the email addresses of the Chief Editor, the Springer-Nature journal Manager and a Springer Editorial Assistant. You will be asked to reply to this email agreeing to the proposed topic and timing, including all respondents in your reply. (iii.) Preparing and submitting your Review : The agreed upon submission deadline provides for eight weeks to have your manuscript reviewed and requested revisions completed. Typically, you will receive two expert critiques of your manuscript within 4 weeks. If the reviews are favorable, the journal will then request that the necessary revisions be made within 2 weeks of receipt of the initial critique. Upon receiving the revised manuscript, it will (if necessary) be sent back to the reviewers for a second review, after which a decision will be conferred by the handling Editor. If accepted, your manuscript will then enter into production. The first stage of production involves copyright transfer and decision on article payment by the corresponding author. As mentioned previously, the journal operates a hybrid two-track option with regard to copyright transfer and payment (Hall  2019b ). The first option is completely free but involves the review article remaining behind a pay firewall for a period of 6 to 12 months. The second option involves payment of an open access fee which removes the payment firewall for your article. Both options produce an excellent outcome and the author is entirely free to choose which payment pathway to proceed along. The second stage of production involves the desktop publishing of your article by the Springer-Nature professional staff. Typically, the corresponding author will receive online page proofs of the article within 2 weeks of resolution of the copyright transfer agreement. This stage represents the last chance for minor corrections to be made. (iv.) Post-publication promotion of your article : Following publication, the corresponding author will receive a request to participate in a social media promotion particular to the Issue in which their article appears. The participation process involves (a) application for a Springer SharedIt TM  link for the published article, (b) filling out a  pro forma  template with information on your article such as title, summary, and professional contact information. As discussed previously, the SharedIt TM  program provides a copyright-free means for unlimited posting and sharing of your article on any form of social media, personal or professional website (Hall  2017 ). Based around the SharedIt TM  program, the journal uses the information provided by the author(s) in two ways. The first way involves the posting of a 4-minute video summary of the Issue contents to the Biophysical Reviews’ YouTube TM  channel. Set to a variable genre of musical accompaniment, the Issue summary represents a very modern method for skimming the Issue contents and is a feature currently unique to Biophysical Reviews. The journal’s YouTube TM  channel can be found here: 
 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzG_5MWmnrB2UBibtxs2DuA 
 The second means of using the article summary information involves its individual “tweeting” with cross posting of the information contained on both the Biophysical Reviews’ YouTube TM  channel and official Springer website. The Biophysical Review’s Twitter TM  account can be found at the following address: @BiophysicalRev1 
 Both the YouTube TM  and Twitter TM  accounts are intentionally non-controversial (i.e., YouTube TM  comments are disabled and only Twitter TM  Followers are able to post mentions). Nevertheless, the content on both of these platforms can be used by authors for promotion of their work through reposting and retweeting by either themselves or their Institutional media representatives. The journal website monitors these alternative metrics under the altimetric banner associated with each online article. Having the official imprimatur of the journal promoting your work may help to add some social media “kudos” to your own (or a student’s) retweeting of the importance of your published work. Indeed, the leveraging of this journal provided advantage by the author is a major goal of the journal’s social media program and we highly encourage our authors to engage in these activities. The Michèle Auger Award for 2021 The close of 2018 brought with it the sad news of the death of Biophysical Reviews’ Editorial Board Member, Prof. Michèle Auger (IUPAB  2019 ). With the kind support of Springer-Nature Corporation, Biophysical Reviews announced the creation of a perpetual memorial award in honor of Michèle’s life and service. The “Michèle Auger Award for Young Scientists’ Independent Research” is to be granted each year to a single candidate performing biophysical research, who is under 40 years of age at the time of application. The award consists of a plaque, a free personal subscription to the journal, and an invitation to submit a single author review article to be published in Biophysical Reviews. The published Review will carry a short foreword about the life of Prof. Michèle Auger, along with her work associated with teaching and training the next generation of biophysical scientists. Nominations for the 2021 award can be made in the form of a candidate’s one-page  curriculum vitae,  along with five original manuscripts, to be submitted by email to either the Chief Editor or any one of the Biophysical Review’s Executive Editors, prior to October 31st. Judging will be carried out by a special committee assembled from the Editorial Board, with this assembly taking place after the submission deadline. The winner will be announced in late December, with the winner’s single-author Review to be published in the following year. The 2020 Michèle Auger Award proved quite popular with over 28 applications received by the deadline close in late 2019. The winner of the inaugural award for 2020 was Dr. Alexandra Zidovska. Alexandra is currently an NSF Career Fellow and Assistant Professor at the Center for Soft Matter Research, Department of Physics, New York University. More about her research can be found at her laboratory home page. 
 https://as.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/as/faculty/alexandra-zidovska.html 
 Alexandra’s review article will appear as the lead article of Volume 12 Issue 5 (to be published mid-October 2020). In line with Michèle’s interest in promoting young scientist’s research work, the journal encourages nominations for the coming 2021 competition. Concluding remarks Due to its association with the International Union for Pure and Applied Biophysics (IUPAB) Biophysical Reviews is genuinely interested in fostering international research and education in biophysical research. Some of the actions of Biophysical Reviews in furthering these goals can be appreciated by reading the end of year and year opening summaries (Hall  2019c ; Hall  2020b ). Volume 12 Issue 2 was the first experiment for the journal in partnering with a national biophysical society to assist in promoting the collective work of its members on a world platform. I would again like to thank the Biophysical Society of Japan and the Special Issue Editors (Komatsuzaki et al.  2020 ) for their enthusiastic and wholehearted cooperation with that endeavor. That Special Issue is to date the largest ever run by the journal and was concluded under genuinely challenging circumstances. In regard to this last point, I would like to acknowledge the extraordinary dedication of the journal’s professional staff working at the Springer-Nature offices in the Philippines. As a final note, I would like to express my personal thanks to the Nagoya Institute of Technology (NITech) for facilitating my return to Japan in March. With over a 115-year history, NITech is a specialist science, engineering, and technology university located within Nagoya—the capital city of Aichi prefecture in central Japan. Similar to the growing worldwide trend for such activities, NITech has recently made efforts to attract overseas students into its graduate programs as well as provide its domestic students greater exposure to international research venues. More can be found out about the Nagoya Institute of Technology here (NITech  2020 ). </Body>

    <Abstact>We review work on the paramagnetic amino acid 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-N-oxyl-4-amino-4-carboxylic acid, TOAC, and its applications in studies of peptides and peptide synthesis. TOAC was the first spin label probe incorporated in peptides by means of a peptide bond. In view of the rigid character of this cyclic molecule and its attachment to the peptide backbone via a peptide bond, TOAC incorporation has been very useful to analyze backbone dynamics and peptide secondary structure. Many of these studies were performed making use of EPR spectroscopy, but other physical techniques, such as X-ray crystallography, CD, fluorescence, NMR, and FT-IR, have been employed. The use of double-labeled synthetic peptides has allowed the investigation of their secondary structure. A large number of studies have focused on the interaction of peptides, both synthetic and biologically active, with membranes. In the latter case, work has been reported on ligands and fragments of GPCR, host defense peptides, phospholamban, and β-amyloid. EPR studies of macroscopically aligned samples have provided information on the orientation of peptides in membranes. More recent studies have focused on peptide–protein and peptide–nucleic acid interactions. Moreover, TOAC has been shown to be a valuable probe for paramagnetic relaxation enhancement NMR studies of the interaction of labeled peptides with proteins. The growth of the number of TOAC-related publications suggests that this unnatural amino acid will find increasing applications in the future.</Abstact>
    <Body>Historical data In 2011, when we celebrate 30 years since the first publication on the synthesis of TOAC-labeled peptides, we present a brief account of the history of nitroxides and their use as spin labels for studies of the structure and dynamics of biologically relevant molecules and organized systems. The synthesis of nitroxides was first described by Lebedev (Lebedev and Kazarnovskii  1959 ) and by Hoffmann and Henderson ( 1961 ). Nitroxides are extremely interesting from the chemical point of view, since, in contrast with the vast majority of free radicals, that are highly unstable, the –NO group is stable under a variety of physicochemical conditions. This allows the obtaining of their EPR spectra in different solvents, including water, in a range of pH and temperature. Scientists from the Soviet Union made a great contribution to the development of the chemistry of nitroxides, as well as the knowledge of their physicochemical and spectroscopic properties (see the book by Rozantsev  1970 ). This contribution has continued until the present days. In France, the group of A. Rassat also reported a great number of studies on the chemistry, physical chemistry, and spectroscopy of nitroxides. The groups of J.F.W. Keana in the USA and of K. Hideg in Hungary have described the synthesis of a vast number of nitroxide-containing compounds. Computer programs for spectral simulations of spin label spectra have been extensively developed by the group of J.H. Freed in the USA. In view of the fact that EPR spectroscopy is performed in the microwave range of the electromagnetic spectrum, EPR spectra are very convenient for obtaining information about the motion of molecules, in particular macromolecules. Moreover, EPR spectra are also sensitive to the orientation of molecules with respect to the magnetic field, which renders them very useful for studies of anisotropic systems such as membranes. The use of nitroxides to obtain conformational information about biological molecules via their EPR spectra was first described by McConnell and coworkers in 1965 in a paper that reported studies of polylysine and bovine serum albumin (Stone et al.  1965 ). This paper followed the first attempt to introduce a paramagnetic reporter group in an otherwise EPR-silent macromolecule; in this first study, Ohnishi and McConnell ( 1965 ) intercalated the chlorpromazine cation radical in a nucleic acid. However, this species was not very stable, pointing to the need for a more convenient reporter group. This role was most adequately performed by the nitroxide group. During the next 15 years, EPR studies of spin-labeled proteins were extensively published. In almost all the studies, proteins were labeled by coupling nitroxide-containing molecules to reactive groups of amino acid side chains, mostly the –SH group of cysteine. The potentiality of cysteine labeling underwent enormous expansion upon the introduction of SDSL by Hubbell and coworkers (Todd et al.  1989 ; Altenbach et al.  1989 ), which brought about the possibility of choosing the residue to be investigated. Nitroxide spin labels were also used, albeit to a lesser extent, for studies of other macromolecules—nucleic acids and polysaccharides. On the other hand, the EPR spectra of nitroxides have been largely exploited in studies of membranes. The first paper in this field was published by Hubbell and McConnell ( 1968 ). Indeed, the EPR spectra of nitroxides were among the first data that provided evidence for molecular motions of lipids in membranes—rotation about the long molecular axis (Hubbell and McConnell  1969 ; Hsia et al.  1970 ), intramolecular  trans-gauche  isomerization (Seelig  1970 ; Hubbell and McConnell  1971 ; Schreier-Muccillo et al.  1973 ), flip-flop (Kornberg and McConnell  1971 ), and lateral diffusion (Devaux and McConnell  1972 ; Sackmann and Träuble  1972a ,  b ; Träuble and Sackmann  1972 ). In 1981, Nakaie et al. ( 1981 ) introduced a new strategy for conformational studies of peptides by means of EPR spectroscopy; in this report, the authors described the use of TOAC (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-N-oxyl-4-amino-4-carboxylic acid), whose synthesis was reported by Rassat and Rey ( 1967 ), for the synthesis of peptides where the unnatural spin-labeled amino acid was incorporated for the first time in the chain via a peptide bond. An article focusing on TOAC and its applications appeared in  Chemical and Engineering News  (Wilson  2000 ), and a review of work on TOAC-containing peptides was published (McNulty and Millhauser  2002 ). Introduction When spin labels are bound to an amino acid side chain, their EPR spectra will reflect, in addition to the properties of the backbone, the contribution of side chain flexibility, as well as that of the label molecule itself with respect to the polypeptide backbone. In this context, an interesting alternative to examine the conformational properties of proteins and peptides is the binding of a spin label directly to the backbone. The coupling of TOAC to the peptide chain  via a peptide bond  was first accomplished by incorporating this α-amino acid into model compounds, the peptide hormone angiotensin II, and some of its analogs (Nakaie et al.  1981 ,  1983 ). The SPPS methodology available at the time (Merrifield  1963 ; Stewart and Young,  1984 ) relied on the use of the Boc protecting group for the amino group; this approach requires strong acid conditions in the deprotection step, preventing the incorporation of TOAC in internal positions, since the acid treatment causes loss of the paramagnetic group. When the Fmoc-based methodology became available (Atherton and Sheppard  1989 ; Fields and Noble  1990 ), Marchetto et al. ( 1993 ) published the first report describing the synthesis of angiotensin II analogues labeled with TOAC at internal positions in the peptide chain. It should be mentioned that an attempt to introduce TOAC in a protein by means of genetic engineering was not successful (Cornish et al.  1994 ), possibly due to steric effects (see below). The use of TOAC has gained notable expansion, mostly in the study of conformational and dynamical properties of peptides. The group of Glenn L. Millhauser has published a series of papers making use of TOAC’s EPR spectra to investigate peptide secondary structure (see “ Synthetic peptides ”). A major contribution in the field has come from the group of Claudio Toniolo, at the University of Padova. Figure  1  displays the growth of the use of TOAC in the past 15 years. Studies of peptides and other applications, such as the use of TOAC’s EPR spectra to monitor the effect of physicochemical conditions on SPPS, will be the object of this review. We intend to cover most of the literature; due to length limitations, the information contained in these papers is presented in a succinct manner.

 TOAC and TOAC-containing peptides: synthesis and structural, physicochemical, and spectroscopic properties The synthesis of TOAC was first described by Rassat and Rey ( 1967 ). Other nitroxide-derived α-amino acids have been synthesized (Lex et al.  1982 ; Csekö et al.  1985 ; Balog et al.  2003 ). A spirocyclohexyl nitroxide α-amino acid was synthesized and proposed to be useful for distance measurements by means of pulsed EPR (Rajca et al.  2010 ). α-amino acids have also been synthesized and incorporated in peptides. In an attempt to overcome the low nucleophilicity of TOAC’s amino group towards the acylation reaction during peptide chain elongation, Tominaga et al. ( 2001 ) described the higher efficiency of incorporation of the β-amino acid POAC (Rassat and Rey  1967 ) into angiotensin II. Studies of POAC, as well as of β-TOAC, have addressed synthesis, separation, identification, spectroscopic characterization, and absolute configuration assignment of pure enantiomers (Wright et al.  2003a ,  b ,  2005 ,  2008 ; Péter et al.  2003 ; Dutot et al.  2008 ). The synthesis and conformational characterization of hexapeptides double-labeled with β-TOAC and POAC have also been reported (Wright et al.  2007 ,  2010 ). Figure  2  presents the structures of the nitroxide-containing α- and β-amino acids TOAC, POAC, and β-TOAC, as well as of the C α,α -disubstituted glycines Aib and Ac6c. The former is a non-proteinogenic amino acid present in peptides that display antimicrobial activity.

 TOAC is a member of the family of C α,α -disubstituted glycines (Toniolo et al.  1995 ) characterized by a six-member, heterocyclic, saturated side chain containing the paramagnetic nitroxide radical which is stabilized by the tetrasubstituted carbon atoms 2 and 6. A quantum mechanical study of TOAC  in vacuo  and in aqueous solution showed that the nitroxyl group in an equatorial position is more stable than in the axial position (D'Amore et al.  2003 ). In addition, the crystallographic characterization of some TOAC derivatives showed the piperidine ring in an approximate  chair  conformation, with the α-amino group in the axial position and the α-carboxyl group in the equatorial position (Flippen-Anderson et al.  1996 ; Crisma et al.  2005 ). The nitroxyl group presents two absorption bands in the UV-visible region, ascribed to the n → π* (ʎ = 420–450 nm, ɛ = 5–20 L mol −1  cm −1 ) and to the π → π* transitions (ʎ ~ 240 nm, ɛ = 10 3 –10 4  L mol −1  cm −1 ); the former band is sensitive to solvent polarity (Dupeyre et al.  1964 ; Brière et al.  1965 ). EPR and cyclic voltammetry studies showed that the NO group can undergo reversible redox processes (Toniolo et al.  1995 ), as well as reversible protonation (Nakaie et al.  1981 ,  2002 ; Pertinhez et al.  1997 ). TOAC-containing peptides were exploited as potential catalysts for enantioselective oxidation (Formaggio et al.  2002 ). Based on TOAC’s redox properties, Gatto et al. ( 2008 ) examined the efficiency of peptide-based self-assembled monolayers to mediate electron transfer and photoinduced electron transfer processes on gold substrates. TOAC-containing model compounds and peptides present high crystallinity allowing for X-ray diffraction studies. Crystallographic studies of synthetic peptides showed that TOAC preferentially adopts helical backbone torsion angles (Toniolo et al.  1995 ; Flippen-Anderson et al.  1996 ; Crisma et al.  1997 ,  2005 ,  2007 ; Saviano et al.  2004 ). These results are in accordance with EPR solution studies (see below) and show that TOAC also induces 3 10 /α-helical backbone conformation in the crystal state. These findings are in agreement with the view that members of the family of C α,α -disubstituted glycines, such as Aib, Ac6c, and TOAC, favor β-bends and 3 10 /α-helices (Toniolo et al.  1995 ). X-ray diffraction studies of alanine-based peptides indicated a preference of the piperidine ring for the  twist-boat  conformation (Flippen-Anderson et al.  1996 ; Crisma et al.  2005 ). Crystal studies of TOAC-containing biologically active peptides will be referred to in the corresponding sections. Making use of the fact that, being paramagnetic, TOAC is a fluorescence quencher, photophysical studies have been performed with peptides containing TOAC and an intrinsic or incorporated fluorophore bound to the same or a different peptide, or to a phospholipid. TOAC was shown to quench the fluorescence of tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine, Bin, Bpa, Fmoc, β-(1-azulenyl)-L-alanine, BODIPY, and NBD, the two latter attached to phospholipids. References concerning these studies are given in the following sections. As for EPR spectral properties, like other known nitroxide-containing molecules, TOAC’s spectra are sensitive to the polarity of the environment, the isotropic hyperfine splitting  a 
 N  decreasing with decreasing polarity. Based on the polarity dependence of  a 
 N , Malavolta et al. ( 2008 ) demonstrated a correlation between  a 
 N  and a polarity parameter consisting of the sum of solvent electron acceptor (AN) and electron donor (DN) properties (AN+DN). An alternative polarity scale based on this parameter was proposed as a result of solvation studies of polymers (Cilli et al.  1996 ; Malavolta et al.  2002 ). Taking advantage of the sensitivity of  a 
 N  and  g  values to the polarity of the environment, Marsh and Toniolo ( 2008 ) derived a calibration method to determine the location of TOAC at selected positions in membrane-active peptides. The authors determined the polarity dependence of  a 
 N  and  g  for a TOAC-containing dipeptide and for a DOXYL-containing fatty acid in a range of protic and aprotic media. Correlating these datasets, a polarity profile was established for TOAC in a transmembrane peptide. A similar calibration was deduced for MTSSL, used in protein SDSL. In contrast to the well-known polarity effects on EPR spectra of nitroxides, a demonstration of the pH-dependence of EPR spectra of nitroxides containing ionizable groups was first presented by Nakaie et al. ( 1981 ). Changes in  a 
 N  in the spectra of TOAC and model TOAC-containing dipeptides yielded titration curves, allowing the accurate determination of the pK of the ionizable amino and carboxyl groups. It was shown that this resulted from the slow exchange in the EPR timescale between the charged and uncharged species, each yielding a spectrum that contributed to the observed spectrum according to the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation. While the pK of free TOAC’s amino group was 8.0, in TOAC-Gly this value decreased to 5.8. Similar effects were found for N-terminally TOAC-labeled peptides; in addition, pH-modulated conformational changes were also found in these studies (see below). Synthetic peptides The advantage of TOAC over side chain-attached spin labels resides in the fact that the former is linked via a peptide bond; moreover, due to its cyclic structure, the molecule’s restricted mobility hampers rotation about side chain bonds. In contrast, side chain-attached spin labels lead to higher conformational freedom, rendering the analysis of backbone conformation more difficult. One approach that has been used, especially in the study of synthetic peptides, consists in examining double-labeled peptides. Measurements of spin–spin interactions in the EPR spectra allow the calculation of distances between two TOAC residues in the same peptide chain, and, therefore, the determination of peptide secondary structure (Smythe et al.  1995 ; Hanson et al.  1996a ,  b ,  1998 ). For biradicals tumbling fast in the time scale of the experiment, the spectral line shapes are determined primarily by exchange interactions, which are described by the exchange integral J (Luckhurst  1976 ). In the case of strong exchange, J »  a 
 N  ( a 
 N  is the isotropic hyperfine coupling constant), and the spectrum is characterized by a five-line pattern with intensities 1:2:3:2:1. In flexible molecules, distance fluctuations between the radicals result in a modulation of J that can preferentially broaden the second and fourth lines. Biradicals can also exhibit electron—electron dipolar couplings. For fast tumbling peptides, this interaction averages to zero and does not contribute to the EPR spectrum. On the other hand, for molecules tumbling slowly in the EPR time scale ( e.g ., at low temperature), measurement of dipolar interactions can also yield distances between two labeled residues (Hanson et al.  1996a ). Smythe et al. ( 1995 ) examined a 16-residue alanine-based TOAC-double-labeled peptide. The results differed from those previously obtained for a side chain-attached label (Miick et al.  1992 ), showing that in aqueous solution the peptide acquires α-helical and not 3 10 -helical conformation. TOAC double-labeling studies of the influence of solvent, chain length, presence of N-terminal blocking groups, and insertion of the strong helix-favoring amino acid Aib showed that these factors affect the backbone geometry of alanine-rich peptides, and also that TOAC is a strong helix stabilizer (Toniolo et al.  1995 ; Hanson et al.  1996a ,  b ,  1998 ). Figure  3  presents the EPR spectra of double-labeled hexameric peptides with TOAC in different relative positions as a function of solvent (Hanson et al.  1996a ). In MeOH, strong biradical interactions were observed consistent with the geometry of a 3 10 -helix. The solvents displayed differing tendencies to support helical structures with the ranking MeOH &gt; EtOH &gt; TFE &gt; HFIP. Spin-spin interaction was also measured in mono- and tri-labeled peptides. Polese et al. ( 1999 ) monitored inter-helix interaction in mono-labeled 3 10 -helical peptides covalently tethered to a cyclo-dipeptide template, and Sartori et al. ( 2005 ) showed that the conformational regularity of a linear tri-labeled octapeptide (3 10 -helix) is disrupted by an increase in solvent polarity. McNulty et al. ( 2000 ) used this methodology to study fold ⇌ unfold intermediates.

( 1996a ), with permission of the American Chemical Society 
 Elsäber et al. ( 2005 ) performed X-band (at 80 K) and W-band (at 80 and 5 K) studies to evaluate the relative orientation of two TOAC residues incorporated at different distances in the primary structure of  de novo  synthesized 15-mer peptides designed to form an α-helix. By means of simulations of spectra obtained in different solvents, the authors calculated the distance and relative orientation of the two nitroxides, thus obtaining structural information. The conformations found were solvent-dependent and did not correlate with any of the typical helix types adopted by peptides. Carlotto et al. ( 2007 ) and Zerbetto et al. ( 2007 ) developed computational approaches to simulate EPR spectra determined by the conformational properties of TOAC-containing peptides. The combination of different biophysical techniques can provide more complete information on peptide conformational properties. In this context, EPR, CD, fluorescence, FT-IR, NMR, and X-ray crystallography have been used in studies of TOAC-containing peptides. An example is a study of a series of peptides containing the tricyclic C α,α -disubstituted glycine Afc and either TOAC or Gly (Crisma et al.  2000 ). The results confirmed previous findings showing that Afc may adopt either a fully extended or a turn conformation. In another study, Venanzi et al. ( 2004 ) used FTIR, NMR, steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence, and molecular mechanics to investigate constrained hexapeptides containing a fluorescent analogue of tryptophan as well as TOAC. Although TOAC is an achiral molecule, Bui et al. ( 2000 ) explained the unusual far-UV CD spectrum of a TOAC double-labeled hexapeptide that did not correspond to the known elements of secondary structure in terms of a dominating contribution by the peptide-induced CD of the TOAC π → π* transition. A band was also found in the visible region and was ascribed to TOAC’s n → π* transition. The intensity of this transition could be correlated to peptide conformation. However, in studies with other peptides, TOAC did not seem to disturb the CD spectra of these molecules in the far-UV region ( e.g ., Schreier et al.  2004 ; Esposito et al.  2006 ; Venanzi et al.  2006 ). Moreover, the NO group does not present any vibrational bands in the amide A, amide I, and amide II regions (Toniolo et al.  1995 ). Photophysical studies were also performed, in particular making use of TOAC’s fluorescence quenching ability. In cases where the center-to-center TOAC–fluorophore distance was more than 9 Å, the quenching mechanism was described as a Förster energy transfer (dipole–dipole interaction) from the excited fluorophore to TOAC, provided the mutual orientation of the fluorophore and TOAC was taken into account (Pispisa et al.  1998 ; Toniolo et al.  1998 ,  1999 ; Pispisa et al.  2000a ,  b ,  2002 ,  2003a ,  b ). Time-resolved EPR with pulsed laser excitation experiments showed that the intramolecular quenching by TOAC of a fluorophore in the triplet excited state occurs by enhanced intersystem crossing to the ground state via an electron-exchange process (Corvaja et al.  2000a ,  b ). Use of TOAC EPR spectra to assess peptide orientation in membranes The study of location and orientation of membrane-active peptides upon interaction with membranes is important for the understanding of their mechanism of action at a molecular level. EPR studies of spin-labeled peptides can provide useful information concerning this topic. Due to the fact that TOAC is rigidly attached to the peptide backbone, if the nitroxide orientation is determined in a given system,  e.g . in membranes, from the knowledge of TOAC’s relative orientation with respect to the axis of the secondary structure, it is possible to obtain information about the orientation of the backbone with respect to the bilayer normal. Marsh ( 2006 ) described a procedure to obtain orientational information about TOAC-containing peptides that acquire α-helical and β-strand conformations in membranes from calculated order parameters. Crystal structure studies of peptides indicated a preference of the TOAC ring for the  twist-boat  conformation (see “ TOAC and TOAC-containing peptides: synthesis and structural, physicochemical, and spectroscopic properties ”, above). Taking advantage of this information, Marsh derived the tilt of the nitroxide z-axis for both mirror-image  twist-boat  conformers relative to the α-helical and β-strand axes by building the various TOAC crystal structures into the refined coordinates of α-poly-L-alanine and β-poly-L-alanine structures. The author found that the nitroxide z-axis was inclined at 13 ± 2 and 65 ± 3º, with respect to the α-helix axis, or at 25 ± 3 and 32 ± 3º with respect to the β-strand axis, showing that it is possible to use the EPR order parameter to obtain the tilt of TOAC with respect to the bilayer normal; then, making use of the known tilt of the nitroxide z-axis relative to the α-helix and β-strand axes obtained from crystal structures, one can determine the orientation of these axes relative to the bilayer normal. This analysis was applied to TOAC-containing analogues of alamethicin in macroscopically-aligned phospholipid bilayers (see “ Alamethicin ”, below). An approach to determine the tilt of an α-helical TOAC-containing peptide in macroscopically-aligned model membranes based on hyperfine splitting values of the EPR spectra was described by Lorigan and coworkers. In aligned systems, the macroscopic orientation of the bilayer normal with respect to the static magnetic field is known. Then, through the orientation of the nitroxide z-axis with respect to the magnetic field obtained from the hyperfine splittings, it is possible to obtain the orientation of the nitroxide moiety with respect to the bilayer normal. Hence, due to the spatial relationship between the nitroxide group and the helix axis (obtained from the crystal structure), it is possible to determine the orientation of the peptide in the membrane-bound state (Inbaraj et al.  2006 ). As a model to validate the methodology, Lorigan and collaborators used TOAC-labeled analogues of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor transmembrane helical domain M2δ (EKMSTAISVLLAQAVCLLLTSQR) incorporated into aligned bicelles (Inbaraj et al.  2006 ), phospholipid bilayer nanotube arrays (Karp et al.  2006 ), and phospholipid bilayers interfaced between glass plate substrates (Inbaraj et al.  2007 ). The results yielded a helical tilt angle ranging between 14º and 16º, compatible with solid-state NMR data, as well as molecular dynamics simulation. Theoretical calculations of hyperfine splitting values derived from EPR spectra of TOAC-labeled α-helical M2δ in aligned membranes have also been reported (Newstadt et al.  2009 ). Biologically active peptides: ligands and fragments of G protein-coupled receptors Angiotensin and bradykinin The vasoactive peptides angiotensin II (DRVYIHPF, AII) and bradykinin (RPPGFSPFR, BK) bind to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Studies of these peptides will be presented concomitantly. In the early work by Nakaie et al. ( 1983 ), AII analogues containing TOAC at the N-terminus (TOAC 0 -AII and TOAC 1 -angiotensinamide) were examined by EPR spectroscopy. Solution spectra showed a pH-dependence of peptide conformation, and the analysis of  a 
 N  yielded a pK of TOAC’s amino group around 4.5. When the methodology to incorporate TOAC in internal positions became available (Marchetto et al.  1993 ), it was of interest to evaluate the effect of this incorporation on peptide biological activity. This is clearly a concern in the case of biologically active peptides that have a flexible solution conformation, such as small peptide hormones, whose binding to receptors requires the acquisition of very specific conformations. One might expect that incorporation of TOAC—which, in addition to favoring α-helical and 3 10 -helical conformations, also favors β-turn formation (Toniolo et al.  1998 )—could affect receptor binding and, therefore, biological activity. Functional studies of AII (TOAC 1 -AII and TOAC 3 -AII) and BK (TOAC 0 -BK and TOAC 3 -BK) analogues showed that, while N-terminally-labeled peptides retained at least part of their biological activity, internally-labeled analogues were inactive, possibly due to the fact that the TOAC-imposed bend did not allow acquisition of the receptor-bound conformation (Nakaie et al.  2002 ; Santos et al.  2008 ). In order to obtain more detailed information and compare the conformational properties of TOAC-containing analogues to those of native peptides, in addition to EPR, CD and fluorescence studies were performed in solution (as a function of pH and of addition of the secondary structure-inducing solvent TFE) and in the presence of model membranes (micelles and phospholipid bilayer vesicles of variable composition). Studies with model membranes were performed in view of the Membrane Compartment Theory (Schwyzer  1995 ), which proposes that, once bound, the peptide concentration increases in the membrane phase and it diffuses bidimensionally, increasing the probability of interacting with the receptor. Furthermore, binding to the membrane might displace the peptide conformational equilibrium, favoring acquisition of the receptor-bound conformation. Schreier et al. ( 2004 ) showed that the EPR spectra of TOAC 1 -AII and TOAC 0 -BK were sensitive to the pH-titration of TOAC’s amino group ( a 
 N  values and rotational correlation times, τ C ). Moreover, the rotational correlation times of peptides labeled at position 3 were considerably larger than those of N-terminally-labeled peptides, evincing the greater freedom of motion at the N-terminus. CD spectra of N-terminally labeled analogues indicated a flexible backbone and, in most cases, were similar to those of native peptides; in contrast, spectra of peptides containing TOAC at position 3 suggested a more restricted conformation. Furthermore, TOAC caused quenching of Tyr 4  fluorescence, which was more intense in the case of TOAC 3 -AII due to the closer proximity of the nitroxide. TFE caused a considerable increase in τ C  values. It was concluded that EPR spectra monitored both the increased solvent viscosity and the peptide’s acquisition of secondary structure. CD spectra showed that the native peptides and the N-terminally-labeled analogues acquired similar conformations. On the other hand, different folds were achieved by TOAC 3 -AII and TOAC 3 -BK. In the latter case, comparison with the Aib 3 -BK analogue (Cann et al.  1987 ) showed that the spectra of both peptides are very similar, demonstrating that both residues indeed impose a similar bend (different from that promoted by the Pro residue in the native peptide), even in non-helical peptides. It was proposed that the conformational behavior provides an explanation for the lack of biological activity of TOAC 3 -AII and TOAC 3 -BK. Combined EPR and CD studies were also performed on the interaction of BK (Vieira et al.  2002 ) and AII (Vieira et al.  2009 ) and their TOAC-labeled analogues with detergent micelles—negatively charged SDS and zwitterionic HPS. Line broadening in the EPR spectra indicated micelle binding (Fig.  4 ). The peptides bound to a much greater extent to negatively charged SDS, pointing to the importance of electrostatic interactions. Nevertheless, binding to HPS could still be detected, suggesting that other interactions (hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions) contributed to the energetics of binding. The small decrease of  a 
 N  values suggested a membrane–water interface location for the peptides. Upon binding, the peptides acquired secondary structure, evincing that the less polar membrane environment favors intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The acquired conformations followed a pattern similar to that previously found, i.e., the N-terminally-labeled peptides acquired conformations similar to those of the native peptides, whereas those labeled at position 3 acquired different folds. Both EPR and CD spectra indicated that, upon binding, the peptides underwent pH-dependent conformational changes. Binding caused an increase of fluorescence of AII and its analogues. The differences in conformation achieved by the native and N-terminally-labeled peptides versus those labeled at position 3 corroborated the proposal that the lack of biological activity of the latter is related to the TOAC-imposed bend in these peptides.

 In more recent work, Marín ( 2007 ) and Marín et al. ( 2011 ) examined the interaction of the same peptides with micelles of LPC or 1:1 mol:mol LPC:LPG, as well as with vesicles of POPC or 1:1 mol:mol POPC:POPG. In addition to CD and EPR, fluorescence measurements of Tyr 4  in AII and of Phe 5  and Phe 8  in BK were performed. Again, the peptides bound to a much lesser extent to zwitterionic than to negatively charged membranes, binding being more pronounced at lower pH (when the peptides carry higher positive charge), corroborating the role of electrostatic interactions for binding. Quantitation of free and membrane-bound peptide populations in the EPR spectra allowed calculation of partition coefficients. Differential quenching by TOAC 1 -AII of the fluorescence of phospholipids carrying NBD at different positions corroborated the notion that the peptide is located at the membrane–water interface. Teixeira et al. ( 2007 ) examined the effect of TOAC incorporation on the cleavage of analogues of the AII precursor, angiotensin I (DRVYIHPFHL, AI) by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Biological assays showed that the enzyme was selective with respect to labeling position, cleaving only TOAC 1 -AI and TOAC 3 -AI. The lack of activity towards TOAC 8 -AI and TOAC 9 -AI indicated that sterical hindrance at the C-terminus probably does not allow substrate binding to the active site. Differences in EPR spectral lineshapes of TOAC 3 -labeled peptides were sufficient to allow the distinction between the substrate and the product. Quenching of Tyr 4  fluorescence by TOAC decreased with increasing distance between both residues, suggesting an overall partly extended conformation of AI. Lopes and collaborators ( 2008 ) described a novel EPR approach to evaluate the binding site of AII to its transmembrane AT 1  receptor. The authors used a biologically active agonist (TOAC 1 -AII) and an inactive control (TOAC 4 -AII) to assess the peptides interaction with fragments of AII’s AT 1  receptor in solution. EPR spectra showed that TOAC 1 -AII, but not TOAC 4 -AII was able to interact with a proposed binding site composed of portions of the receptor N-terminal domain (residues 13–17) and the third extracellular loop (residues 266–278). A study using the same experimental design was done for the interaction of BK with its B2 receptor (Duarte et al.  2011 ). α-melanocyte stimulating hormone, α-MSH The N-terminally-labeled analogue of α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (Ac-SYSMEHFRWGKPV, α-MSH, Ac = acetyl) was the first TOAC-labeled hormone (Ac-TOAC 0 -α-MSH) that retained full biological activity (Barbosa et al.  1999 ). Subsequently, Nakaie et al. ( 2001 ) showed that the TOAC-containing derivative of the more potent α-MSH analogue [Nle 4 ,D-Phe 7 ]α-MSH (Ac-TOAC 0 -[Nle 4 ,D-Phe 7 ]α-MSH), was also fully active. Solution EPR spectra yielded rotational correlation times indicative of a slightly more folded structure for Ac-TOAC 0 -[Nle 4 , D-Phe 7 ]α-MSH than for Ac-TOAC 0 -α-MSH. This was corroborated by TOAC quenching of Trp 9  fluorescence and by time-resolved fluorescence data (Nakaie et al.  2001 ; Fernandez et al.  2005b ). Acid-base titration of the peptides was also monitored by EPR and time-resolved fluorescence (Fernandez et al.  2005b ). Although the latter technique allowed the pK determination of several side chains, the EPR spectra were only slightly pH-dependent, probably because the TOAC amino group was not titrated since it was blocked by the acetyl radical. EPR and time-resolved fluorescence were also used to investigate the interaction between the TOAC-labeled peptides and DMPG (Fernandez et al.  2005a ). EPR spectra showed that both peptides displayed similar, strongly restricted motion, indicating insertion into the membrane, both in the gel and in the liquid crystalline phases.  a 
 N  values showed nitroxide incorporation, albeit not deeply into the bilayer core. Accordingly, time-resolved fluorescence data indicated that the membrane-bound native peptides, as well as their TOAC derivatives, presented similar conformations. Calculation of partition coefficients (P) from free and bound peptide populations in the EPR spectra showed a pH-dependence of P with a pK of ca. 7.5, which was ascribed to the titration of His 6 . Neuropeptide Y, NPY Neuropeptide Y (YPSKPDNPGEDAPAEDLARYYSALRHYINLITRQRY-NH 2 , porcine NPY), one of the most abundant peptides in mammalian central nervous system, binds to at least five GPCRs - Y 1 , Y 2 , Y 4 , Y 5  and Y 6 . NPY analogues containing TOAC at positions 2, 32, and 34 were synthesized (Bettio et al.  2002 ). While [TOAC 34 ]-NPY and [Ala 31 , TOAC 32 ]-NPY showed a marked selectivity for Y 5 , the specific binding of [TOAC 2 ]-NPY to Y 2  and Y 5  was in the same range as that of native NPY; however, the peptide was inactive at Y 1 . The data indicated that TOAC introduction in the N-terminal region is better tolerated than in proximity to the C-terminus. The effect of TOAC on the native peptide structure was examined by CD. The spectra were interpreted in terms of an increased α-helical content in [TOAC 34 ]-NPY. EPR spectra of the labeled peptides showed that NPY interacts with PS vesicles through the C-terminal α-helix, while the N-terminal tail retains flexibility comparable to that in solution. Thomas et al. ( 2005 ,  2009 ) investigated the interaction of the TOAC-labeled peptides with model membranes consisting of variable proportions of PC:PS making use of EPR and NMR, as well as fluorescence. The EPR data were analyzed in terms of three peptide populations: free, dimerized, and membrane-bound. In order to obtain the spectra of the membrane-bound population, potassium chromium oxalate was used to broaden the EPR lines due to peptide free in solution. The presence of free and bound peptide spectra allowed the estimation of partition coefficients, which displayed a pH dependence. The depth of membrane penetration was also evaluated by  1 H NMR MAS experiments. TOAC-promoted PRE depended on its distance from specific phospholipid hydrogens. In spite of the broad distribution of the PRE effect due to the high mobility of both lipid and peptide, the results corroborated the EPR-based conclusions showing that the α-helical part of NPY (amino acids 13–36) penetrates the membrane interface, while the unstructured N-terminal part (amino acids 1–12) extends into the aqueous phase with occasional contacts with the headgroup region. The results also suggested that NPY’s immersion depth is modulated by membrane composition: the NPY α-helix is located in the upper chain region of zwitterionic membranes, being shifted to the glycerol region in negatively charged membranes. In PC:PS membranes, an intermediate position was observed. Finally, membrane location was also verified by fluorescence quenching experiments with the Trp 32 -NPY analogue. It was concluded that electrostatic interactions play an important role in peptide binding. Substance P, SP Shafer et al. ( 2008 ) reported a study where substance P (RPKPQQFFGLM-NH2, SP) was labeled with TOAC at positions 4 or 9 and the affinity of the analogues for the neurokinin-1 receptor was compared to that of native SP. While the binding of TOAC 4 -SP resembled that of the native ligand, TOAC 9 -SP bound to a much lesser extent. Moreover, the signaling potency of TOAC 4 -SP was higher than that of SP itself; in contrast, the potency of position 9-labeled analogue was significantly reduced. EPR spectra reported on these differences. Both peptides gave rise to spectra that indicated restricted mobility in the presence of membranes containing over-expressed receptor. However, while TOAC 4 -SP bound under conditions of low or high receptor activity, a bound signal for TOAC 9 -SP was only obtained when the receptor was in the high-affinity binding state. Molecular dynamics calculations showed that the residue replacing Pro 4  is located at the beginning of an existing helix and does not disturb the flexibility of the N-terminal sequence (“the address sequence”), while maintaining the helical conformation of the following residues. On the other hand, when TOAC replaces Gly 9  in the C-terminal portion (“message domain”), while the peptide also stabilizes in the left-handed helical conformation, it is able to adopt β-sheet conformations, not available in the native peptide. A TOAC-labeled fragment of the  m as oncogene receptor The hypothesis that protein fragments are able to acquire the same conformation they display in the whole molecule has been verified in many cases. Based on this hypothesis, an N-terminally-TOAC-labeled fragment of the  mas  oncogene receptor (EYWSTFGNLHHISL, residues 253–266) encompassing part of the third extracellular loop and the beginning of the seventh transmembrane portion was synthesized, and its interaction with differently charged bilayers and micelles was investigated. EPR spectra showed that, while binding to micelles occurred irrespective of detergent headgroup and charge, no interaction took place with bilayers unless peptide and phospholipid bore opposite charges. Thus, while the peptide bound to negatively charged SDS, positively charged CTAB, zwitterionic LPC and HPS, and neutral Brij-35 micelles, it interacted with DMPG vesicles only at low pH, both in the gel and in the liquid crystalline phase. CD and steady-state fluorescence measurements corroborated these findings (Pertinhez-Sini et al.  1994 ; Pertinhez et al.  1995 ,  1997 ). Partition coefficients were calculated from the estimation of free and membrane-bound populations in the peptide EPR spectra. Biologically active peptides: host defense peptides Host defense peptides (HDP) or antimicrobial peptides (AMP) present a wide action spectrum against pathogenic microorganisms, being considered an alternative to conventional antibiotics (Zasloff  2002 ; Brogden  2005 ). TOAC labeling has been used to gather information about the structure and dynamics of these peptides. In studies of trichogin GA IV (see “ Trichogin GA IV ”) and alamethicin F50/5 (see “ Alamethicin ”), the authors have taken advantage of the fact that TOAC structurally resembles Aib present in the native peptides. Trichogin GA IV A great deal of the present understanding of the structure and dynamic properties of the Aib-rich linear peptaibol trichogin GA IV (nOctUGLUGGLUGILol; nOct = n-octanoyl, U = Aib, Lol = leucinol) has been obtained through studies of analogues where Aib residues have been substituted by TOAC. Since both residues are helix-inducing moieties, one would expect that this substitution would not perturb the peptide conformation (and function) to a significant extent. Indeed, mono- and double-substitution of residues 1, 4, and 8 revealed that the analogues have membrane-modifying properties comparable to those of the native peptide (Epand et al.  1999 ; Monaco et al.  1999a ,  b ). ED-EPR spectra indicated that TOAC at positions 1 and 8 is more flexible than at position 4 (Toropov et al.  1998 ). X-ray diffraction studies showed that, like the native peptide (Toniolo et al.  1994 ), in the crystal state the TOAC-labeled analogues fold as a right-handed, mixed 3 10 /α-helix (Crisma et al.  1997 ; Monaco et al.  1999a ; Saviano et al.  2004 ). Figure  5  shows the structures of two crystallographically independent molecules (a and b) in the asymmetric unit of the TOAC 4,8 -trichogin analogue. In solution, EPR studies of single- and double-labeled peptides showed that the secondary structure remains essentially unchanged when compared to the crystal state (Anderson et al.  1999 ; Monaco et al.  1999a ). The N-terminus adopts a 3 10 -helical structure and the C-terminus is partially folded in an α-helical conformation, also presenting an equilibrium with unfolded conformers. Anderson et al. ( 1999 ) suggested that the Gly–Gly stretch creates a hinge point between two short, but stable helical regions. Furthermore, PELDOR studies were performed to assess the conformation of TOAC-containing analogues when doped in a tetrameric supramolecular assembly of unlabeled peptides (Milov et al.  2001a ), of dimers in frozen glassy solutions (Milov et al.  2004 ), and upon interaction with bilayers (Milov et al.  2005a ,  b ). These results also showed the presence of a mixture of 3 10 /α-helical structure. Far-UV CD spectra corroborated the helical structure of these analogues (Venanzi et al.  2006 ).

 The self-aggregation properties of TOAC-labeled trichogin GA IV analogues were studied mostly by Milov et al. ( 2000a ,  b ,  2001b ,  2002 ,  2003a ,  b ) using PELDOR combined with conventional CW-EPR. While formation of aggregates containing four peptide molecules was seen in an apolar solvent at 77 K, addition of a more polar solvent led to aggregate dissociation. In weakly polar solvents at 77 K, aggregation ( n  = 3.1–4.3 molecules) was dependent on the type of N-terminal group and TOAC position in the peptide chain, as well as solvent composition (Milov et al.  2000a ). Tetramers also formed in solvents of different polarity at room temperature (Milov et al.  2000a ,  2001b ). In addition, in an apolar solvent, the analogues gave rise to concentration-dependent two-component EPR spectra, one ascribed to monomers and the other to aggregates (Milov et al.  2003a ). Moreover, a study of self-aggregation properties of mono- and double-labeled TOAC analogues of two head-to-tail, covalently linked trichogin GA IV molecules was also performed (Milov et al.  2003b ). PELDOR and CW-EPR studies in frozen glassy solutions showed that, while the covalent dimer does not form aggregates in methanol, in chloroform-toluene aggregates ( n  = 2–3) were observed. Aggregation of TOAC-containing trichogin GA IV was not detected in membranes of the bacterium  Micrococcus luteus  (Milov et al.  2002 ), but was found in model membranes when the peptide:lipid ratio was high (mean aggregation number = 2) (Salnikov et al.  2006 ). EPR and fluorescence studies showed that, upon interaction with the membrane, at low peptide:lipid ratio the peptides acquired an in-plane orientation on the membrane surface, while at higher peptide:lipid ratios, the orientation changed to a transmembrane arrangement (Epand et al.  1999 ; Monaco et al.  1999b ; Salnikov et al.  2006 ). In addition, an ED-EPR study showed that the peptides presented two types of orientational motion: at low peptide:lipid ratio, the spectrum indicated fast (nanosecond timescale) motion, whereas upon increasing peptide:lipd ratio, slow (millisecond timescale) motion was observed (Syryamina et al.  2010 ). Alamethicin Alamethicin is a 20-residue linear peptaibol that induces voltage-dependent ion channel activity in lipid membranes. The amino acid sequence of the predominant neutral species, F50/5, is AcUPUAUAQUVUGLUPVUUQQFol (Ac = acetyl, U = Aib, Fol = phenylalaninol). Mono- and double-labeled analogues containing TOAC at positions 1, 8, and 16, and bearing Glu(OMe) residues instead of Gln at positions 7, 18, and 19, were synthesized by Peggion et al. ( 2007a ). The authors showed that all TOAC-containing derivatives exhibited high activity in a leakage assay. Moreover, patch-clamp experiments showed that [TOAC 16 ,Glu(OMe) 7,18,19 ]alamethicin retained the ability to form ion channels in cell membranes, although the current produced was lower compared to the native peptide (Crisma et al.  2007 ). X-ray diffraction studies of [TOAC 16 ,Glu(OMe) 7,18,19 ]alamethicin showed a similar overall folding to that reported for alamethicin (Fox and Richards  1982 ). The conformation was largely α-helical with a bend at the level of Pro 14  (Crisma et al.  2007 ). To assess the solution conformation of TOAC mono- and double-labeled analogues, Peggion et al. ( 2007b ) employed CD, FT-IR, and NMR. The results showed that replacement of Aib residues for TOAC does not affect the peptide α-helical conformation significantly. Furthermore, according to PELDOR spectroscopy, the conformation of [TOAC 1,16 ,Glu(OMe) 7,18,19 ]alamethicin in egg PC vesicles is α-helical at least in the 1–16 segment (Milov et al.  2008 ). Nitroxide to peptide NH proton distances were obtained from PRE studies of [TOAC 1 ,Glu(OMe) 7,18,19 ]alamethicin, which could be used as long-range distance restraints for NMR-based structure determination (Jose et al.  2011 ). The authors showed that the peptide solution conformation is in close agreement with that in the crystal state. Mono-labeled alamethicin analogues (positions 1, 8, and 16) were studied by EPR to characterize their rotational diffusion as a function of solvent viscosity and polarity (Marsh et al.  2007a ). The spectra showed that the peptides remained monomeric in solvents of relatively high polarity. In weakly polar solvents, Milov et al. ( 2007 ) detected aggregation in frozen, glassy solutions at 77 K, as well as in liquid solutions at room temperature. In fluid-phase bilayer membranes of PCs with different chain lengths, alamethicin did not form large stable aggregates (Marsh et al.  2007b ,  c ). This conclusion was based on the lack of spin–spin interactions between monomers in the CW-EPR spectra, together with the fact that the overall rotation of alamethicin is fast in fluid membranes, as shown by ST-EPR experiments that yielded effective correlation times &lt;30 ns. However, in the low-temperature gel phase of DMPC bilayers, spin–spin interaction did suggest aggregation of the TOAC 1 -derivative (Marsh et al.  2007b ). PELDOR spectroscopy showed that the mono-labeled analogues form aggregates with an average number of approximately four in egg PC bilayers at 77 K (Milov et al.  2009 ). Furthermore, at a peptide:lipid ratio of 1:100, spin–spin interaction within POPC bilayers was observed by CW-EPR at 77 K, indicating peptide oligomerization (Salnikov et al.  2009 ). Moreover, spin–spin interactions, monitored by means of ED-EPR at 77 K, indicated a greater tendency to form specific oligomers upon interaction of the peptides with DOPC than with DMPC bilayers (Bartucci et al.  2009 ). Based on CW-EPR spectra of aligned samples and from the relative polarity of the environments experienced by the different TOAC positions (1, 8, and 16), Marsh et al. ( 2007b ) concluded that [Glu(OMe) 7,18,19 ]alamethicin adopts a transmembrane orientation in DMPC fluid bilayers. The authors used the combined order parameters for the different positions to determine the tilt angle of the peptide long axis relative to the bilayer normal. Effective tilt angles of 17–27 º were found over the temperature range 60–85°C. The tilt was shown to be relatively small, even at high temperatures, and to increase rather slowly with decreasing chain length (from 13° to 23° for  n  = 18 and 10, respectively, at 75°C) (Marsh et al.  2007c ). It was concluded that such behavior is insufficient for alamethicin to achieve hydrophobic matching, and that this peptide differs in its mode of incorporation from other helical peptides for which transmembrane orientation has been determined as a function of lipid length. D 2 O-ESEEM experiments showed that water exposure of TOAC analogues differs between membranes of saturated (DMPC) and unsaturated (DOPC) lipids (Bartucci et al.  2009 ). At low temperature, the data indicated a transmembrane location in DOPC, but a more superficial location in DMPC. Corroborating these findings, a transmembrane orientation was found in POPC bilayers, while in DPPC gel phase the peptides switched to an in-plane orientation (Salnikov et al.  2009 ). In addition, ESEEM experiments showed that, while in the transmembrane orientation positions 8 and 16 are screened from the water phase, in the in-plane orientation only residue 16 is screened from water. It was also shown that in egg PC bilayers at 77 K the water accessibility follows the order TOAC 1  &gt; TOAC 8  ~ TOAC 16  (Milov et al.  2009 ). The use of ED-EPR spectra together with spectral simulations and conventional EPR allowed the detection of rapid librational motions of limited angular amplitude for the three mono-labeled analogues in DMPC bilayers (Bartucci et al.  2008 ). This study also showed that torsional fluctuations of the peptide backbone take place in the subnanosecond to nanosecond timescale, with little temperature dependence. Gomesin Analogues of the 18-residue HDP gomesin (ZCRRLCYKQRCVTYCRGR, Z = pyroglutamic acid and disulfide bridges link cysteines 2 and 15, and 6 and 11, Gom) were synthesized with TOAC substituting pyro-Glu both in the native cyclic peptide (TOAC 1 -Gom) and in a linear peptide where the four Cys residues were replaced by Ser (TOAC 1 -Ser 2,6,11,15 -Gom) (Moraes et al.  2007 ). EPR spectra showed that, while TOAC 1 -Gom interacted with SDS, above and below the detergent’s cmc, the linear peptide only interacted above the cmc. Furthermore, only the cyclic analogue bound to LPC micelles, the interaction being less strong than with SDS.  a 
 N  values suggested an interfacial location of the peptides. Moreover, the values of rotational correlation times were higher for the cyclic peptide. In addition, CD spectra showed that, although the micelle-bound peptides acquired β-hairpin conformations, the folds were different for both peptides. Similar to histatin-5 (see below), while the micelle environment induced a β-hairpin conformation, in TFE the linear peptide acquired α-helical conformation. Histatin-5 Histatin-5 (DSHAKRHHGYKRKFHEKHHSHRGY, Hst-5) was TOAC-labeled at the N-terminus (TOAC 0 -Hst-5, Dyszy  2008 ). As previously found, values of  a 
 N  and of the h 0 /h −1  empirical ratio (where h 0  and h −1  are the mid-field and high-field EPR line heights, respectively) reflected the ionization of TOAC 0 -Hst-5 N-terminus. The pK was in the 4.0–5.0 range, corroborating the observation that this value is independent of the nature of the residue next to TOAC. EPR also monitored TFE-induced conformational changes. In spite of its high positive charge, CD spectra showed that TOAC 0 -Hst-5, like its unlabeled counterpart, acquired α-helical conformation in the presence of TFE. Interestingly, when the peptide achieved α-helical conformation, fluorescence quenching occurred, caused by the closer proximity of the nitroxide to the fluorophores (Tyr 10  and Tyr 24 ). Hst-5 interacts with several ions, among them paramagnetic Cu 2+  (Melino et al.  2006 ), the binding site being the D 1 SH 3  sequence. The Cu 2+ -promoted loss of intensity in the EPR spectra of TOAC 0 -Hst-5 was analyzed by means of the Leigh ( 1970 ) theory of spin–spin dipolar coupling making use of parameters taken from Livshits et al. ( 2001 ). An NO-Cu 2+  distance of 4.8 Å was calculated, in agreement with the proposed binding site. Both Hst-5 and TOAC 0 -Hst-5 bound to a greater extent to negatively charged than to zwitterionic micelles. CD spectra indicated that, in contrast with TFE, upon binding, the peptides acquired a β-turn conformation. EPR spectra of TOAC 0 -Hst-5 in the presence of lipid vesicles mimicking the membrane of erythrocytes (negligible surface charge) showed essentially no interaction. In contrast, in the presence of vesicles mimicking the membranes of  E. coli  and  C. albicans  (negative surface charge), the spectra evinced pH-modulated binding, demonstrating that binding is essentially due to electrostatic interactions. The presence of membrane-bound and free peptide populations allowed calculation of partition coefficients. Tryptophan-rich tritrpticin and indolicidin The interaction of the cationic peptide tritrpticin (VRRFPWWWPFLRR, TRP3) and its N-terminally-labeled analogue (TOAC 0 -TRP3) with micelles and vesicles of variable headgroup composition and surface charge was studied making use of EPR, CD, and fluorescence (Bozelli Jr.  2011 ). Broadening of the EPR spectral lines demonstrated TOAC 0 -TRP3 interaction with both zwitterionic and negatively charged micelles, binding being more effective in the latter case. In contrast, the interaction with zwitterionic bilayers was negligible. Thus, while electrostatic interactions were important for peptide-bilayer interaction, they played a less important role in the interaction with micelles.  a 
 N  values demonstrated peptide location at the membrane–water interface. Partition coefficients were calculated, as well as the free energy of binding. The presence of three Trp residues gave rise to electronic transitions in the far-UV, rendering difficult the analysis of CD spectra in terms of peptide secondary structure; nevertheless, binding was seen to promote acquisition of secondary structure, and the peptides conformation was found to depend on aggregate structure: while both peptides acquired similar conformations in all micellar systems, in bilayers, the conformation varied with lipid composition. Binding to membranes promoted an increase in Trp fluorescence; the decrease in maximal emission wavelength was small, corroborating the notion of peptide location close to the membrane–water interface. Fluorescence quenching by the nitroxide group occurred to a small extent, suggesting that the average distance between this group and the Trp residues is too large to allow for significant quenching effects. The N-terminally-labeled TOAC derivative (TOAC 0 -IND) of indolicidin (ILPWKWPWWPWRR-NH 2 , IND) was synthesized and fluorescence spectra of both peptides were studied in solution and in the presence of micelles and of phospholipid vesicles (Souto et al., in preparation). In contrast to the negligible quenching effect of TOAC on the fluorescence spectra of TOAC 0 -TRP3 (see above), considerable quenching was observed for TOAC 0 -IND. Also, in this case, TOAC 0 -IND EPR spectra were pH-sensitive. Moreover, the peptide was able to interact with zwitterionic (LPC) as well as negatively charged (SDS, LPC:LPG) micelles and bilayers (POPC:POPG). However, in contrast to most peptides, TOAC 0 -IND also bound to zwitterionic bilayers (POPC), suggesting that hydrophobic interactions play a more important role in this case. In agreement with this observation, EPR spectra of lipid spin probes showed that addition of native IND increased the order parameter in both micelles and bilayers, although the effect was more pronounced in the former. Membrane-active peptides: a model peptide, phospholamban, β-amyloid A positively charged model peptide Taking into account that water-soluble proteins involved in cell signaling carry positively charged domains that promote their attachment to membranes by means of electrostatic interactions, Victor and Cafiso ( 2001 ) examined the interaction between PC and PC:PS (with varying PS content) bilayers and basic synthetic peptides containing Lys and a variable number of Phe residues ( n  = 0, 2, 3, and 4), in addition to one internally-placed TOAC residue. EPR spectra were used to gather information about the dynamics of free and membrane-bound peptides, binding free energy, and peptide position on the membrane interface. Binding of all peptides increased upon addition of PS. Furthermore, only Phe-containing peptides bound to PC bilayers. Rotational correlation times indicated that the peptides underwent rapid rotation in solution. Upon binding to negatively charged bilayers, the EPR spectra were broadened. For peptides containing only Lys, correlation times were ca. 4 times longer than those in solution. On the other hand, the incorporation of Phe residues increased the correlation times of membrane-bound peptides ca. 20 times. Power-saturation was employed to estimate the position of the peptides in the membrane. While peptides lacking Phe residues were localized within the double layer, ~5 Å above the level of the lipid phosphate, the incorporation of Phe residues shifted the peptides to a location within the bilayer, several angstroms below the phosphate level. The results support the hypothesis that the position and free energy of membrane binding are determined by long-range coulombic attraction, the hydrophobic effect, and a short-range desolvation force. Phospholamban, PLB PLB is an amphipathic 52 amino acid membrane peptide which regulates the Ca-ATPase (SERCA) in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum whose function requires transitions between distinct states of intramolecular dynamics. The group of D.D. Thomas has made a long-time contribution to the understanding of PLB structural and functional properties, mainly through the use of the spin label method. This group undertook the task of synthesizing TOAC-containing PLB derivatives. The synthesis of this peptide including TOAC is a challenge, especially in the addition of TOAC and the next several amino acids. A procedure was described for the synthetic incorporation of TOAC (Karim et al.  2004 ,  2007 ; Zhang et al.  2007 ). EPR spectra were used to optimize the SPPS. EPR of synthetic intermediates, reconstituted into lipid bilayers, was used to ensure complete coupling and Fmoc deprotection. Fmoc-TOAC-OH attachment led to strong probe immobilization, whereas deprotection dramatically mobilized it, producing a peak completely resolved from that observed before deprotection. In the case of TOAC incorporation at position 11, coupling of the next amino acid (Ser) restored strong immobilization, giving a peak completely resolved from that of the preceding step. For several subsequent steps, the effect of coupling and deprotection was similar but less dramatic. Thus, the sensitivity and resolution of EPR provided a quantitative monitor of completion at each of these critical steps in peptide synthesis. Mass spectrometry, CD, and Edman degradation were used in concert with EPR to verify the chemistry and characterize the secondary structure. It was concluded that application of conventional analytical methods in combination with EPR offers an improved approach to optimize the accurate synthesis of TOAC-labeled membrane peptides. Making use of this procedure, PBL derivatives were synthesized, containing a single TOAC residue at positions 0 (TOAC 0 -PLB), 11 (TOAC 11 -PLB), and 24 (TOAC 24 -PLB) in the cytoplasmic domain or at position 46 (TOAC 46 -PLB) in the transmembrane domain. The authors also described a protocol for the functional reconstitution of the spin-labeled protein in lipid vesicles. EPR spectra were used to probe the structural dynamics of TOAC-containing PLB analogues in lipid bilayers (Karim et al.  2004 ). The spectra were analyzed by means of simulations making use of the NLSL software (Budil et al.  1996 ). TOAC 46 -PLB gave rise to a single spectral component indicative of strong immobilization, which was consistent with the presence of a stable, highly ordered transmembrane helix. In contrast, the spectra of the three cytoplasmic domain probes presented two-component spectra corresponding to two conformational states, one of which indicated nearly isotropic nanosecond dynamic disorder. For TOAC 11 -PLB, an N-terminal lipid anchor shifted the equilibrium toward the restricted component, whereas Mg 2+  had the opposite effect. Relaxation enhancement by Ni 2+  ions chelated to lipid headgroups, provided further information about PLB membrane topology, allowing the refinement of an NMR-based structural model. It was concluded that PLB cytoplasmic domain is in dynamic equilibrium between an ordered conformation in direct contact with the membrane surface, and a dynamically disordered form, detached from the membrane and poised to interact with its target. Based on the knowledge that the PLB transmembrane domain inhibits SERCA at low [Ca 2+ ], but the cytoplasmic domain relieves this inhibition upon Ser16 phosphorylation, TOAC 11 -PLB was reconstituted into membranes in the presence or absence of SERCA (Karim et al.  2006 ). The analogue showed normal inhibitory function, reversed by Ser 16  phosphorylation or micromolar [Ca 2+ ]. EPR spectra showed that the PLB cytoplasmic domain exhibits two conformations, an ordered (tense) T state and a dynamically disordered and extended (relaxed) R state. Phosphorylation shifted the equilibrium toward the R state, making it more dynamic (hyperextended). It was concluded that the relief of SERCA inhibition by PLB phosphorylation is due to an order-to-disorder transition in PLB cytoplasmic domain, which allows this domain to extend above the membrane surface and induce a structural change in the cytoplasmic domain of SERCA. Multifrequency EPR is a powerful approach for analysis of complex rotational dynamics of proteins. Since the function of PLB requires transitions between distinct states of intramolecular dynamics, multifrequency experiments were used to define the peptide’s multistate structural dynamics in a lipid bilayer (Nesmelov et al.  2007 ). EPR spectra of TOAC 11 -PLB and TOAC 46 -PLB at 9.4 GHz (X-band) and 94 GHz (W-band) were analyzed in terms of anisotropic rotational diffusion of the two domains. Motion of the transmembrane domain was highly restricted, while the cytoplasmic domain exhibited two distinct conformations, a major one with moderately restricted nanosecond dynamics (T) and another with nearly unrestricted subnanosecond motion (R). The global analysis of spectra at two frequencies yielded much more precise values for rotational correlation times and order parameters than those determined at either frequency alone. β-amyloid peptide Based on evidence that the lipid matrix of neuronal membranes plays a role in β-amyloid peptide β-sheet oligomerization, Esposito et al. ( 2006 ) investigated the interaction between a β-amyloid peptide fragment (GSNKGAAIIGLM, Aβ 25-35 ) containing TOAC at the N- or C-terminus with SDS and DPC micelles, and bilayer vesicles of variable lipid composition employing EPR and CD. A comparison of the CD spectra of the native with those of the labeled peptides revealed that TOAC did not affect peptide conformation. While the CD spectra showed an unordered structure in aqueous solution, the peptides acquired helical conformation upon binding to micelles. Moreover, the peptides also became more structured upon interacting with negatively charged bilayers. When the membranes contained cholesterol and sphingomyelin, present in lipid rafts, a transition from α-helical to β-sheet conformation was observed. EPR spectra showed that, upon binding to micelles, while the peptide containing C-terminally-bound TOAC gave rise to a more strongly immobilized population, the N-terminally-labeled counterpart yielded spectra typical of a more mobile population. A model was proposed whereby the peptide C-terminal portion is highly membrane-associated, while the N-terminal part extends into the aqueous phase, with occasional contacts with the lipid headgroup region. Peptide-macromolecule interaction In recent years novel applications of TOAC have appeared, among those, the use of TOAC-labeled peptides to monitor peptide-peptide, peptide-protein, and peptide-RNA interactions. As already mentioned (see “ Angiotensin and bradykinin ”), Lopes and collaborators ( 2008 ) described an EPR approach to explore the details of angiotensin II binding site to its AT 1  receptor. While the active TOAC 1 -AII analogue was found to interact with a peptide composed of portions of the receptor N-terminal domain and third extracellular loop, inactive TOAC 4 -AII did not display this ability. Zhang et al. ( 2008 ) synthesized by SPPS the basic 55-residue protein NCp-7 of the HIV-1 nucleocapsid, as well as an analogue with TOAC before the N-terminal residue (TOAC 0 -NCp-7). NCp-7 contains two weakly interacting Zn-finger domains and has numerous critical functions in HIV-1 replication. TOAC 0 -NCp-7 displayed biological activity similar to that of the native protein. EPR spectra were analyzed by means of computer simulations making use of the NLSL method (Budil et al.  1996 ). The spectra indicated fast motion of N-terminally located TOAC, both in the holo (Zn 2+ -containing) and in the apo (non-Zn 2+ ) protein; the rate of motion decreased upon interaction with a stem-loop RNA. The conformation of both holo- and apo-TOAC 0 -NCp-7 as a function of TFE was investigated using EPR and CD spectroscopies. Upon addition of TFE, CD spectra indicated that apo-TOAC 0 -NCp-7 shifted from a disordered to α-helical conformation. Accordingly, EPR spectra revealed a great increase in rotational correlation times, due both to protein conformational changes and to TFE-promoted increase of microviscosity. The binding of Zn 2+  in holo-TOAC 0 -NCp-7 caused a loss of helical content in TFE, in agreement with the considerable line narrowing in the EPR spectra. The C-terminal tail of transducin α-subunit, Gtα(340-350) (IKENLKDCGLF), binds to and stabilizes rhodopsin’s active conformation upon photoactivation (R*) (Hamm et al.  1988 ; Dratz et al.  1993 ). NMR results showed that, upon binding, Gtα(340-350) acquires an ordered continuous helical conformation terminated by a C-terminal capping motif (Kisselev et al.  1998 ). Five spin-labeled analogues of Gtα(340-350) were synthesized and were able to bind and stabilize R* in a manner similar to that of the native peptide (Van Eps et al.  2010 ). In this study, TOAC replaced residue 343 in both the native sequence and in a 100-fold higher-affinity peptide (VLEDLKSCGLF) reported from phage display (Martin et al.  1996 ). In addition, 3-carboxy-PROXYL was incorporated at the N-terminus in both peptides. A fifth analogue was synthesized containing the high affinity sequence and both PROXYL at the N-terminus and TOAC replacing Gly 348 . Upon binding to R*, all four mono-labeled peptides gave rise to two-component EPR spectra, due to a protein-bound population and another free in solution. Spectral subtractions showed that the protein-bound populations were strongly immobilized, the TOAC-containing peptides yielding higher correlation times than those carrying the PROXYL moiety. DEER experiments showed that the distances between nitroxides in doubly-labeled PROXYL/TOAC 348 -Gtα(340-350) varied in the range 18–34 Å in solution, a result consistent with an ensemble of conformations for the unbound peptide. In contrast, a narrow distance distribution centered at 19 Å was found for R*-bound Gtα(340-350), consistent with the configuration determined by crystal studies (Scheerer et al.  2008 ) and by NMR (Kisselev et al.  1998 ). It was concluded that TOAC and PROXYL spin labels can be valuable tools to explore the structure and conformational changes at the rhodopsin-G-protein interface. The ATP-binding cassette transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) acts in the adaptive immune defense against infected or malignantly transformed cells. The protein translocates proteasomal degradation products into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum for loading onto MHC class I molecules, displaying a broad substrate spectrum, which suggests that the substrate-binding pocket presents high structural flexibility. Making use of EPR spectroscopy, Herget et al. ( 2011 ) examined conformational properties of the high affinity HLA-B27 restricted epitope RRYQSTEL. Information about side chain dynamics and environmental polarity was obtained from analysis of spectra of 3-iodoacetamido-PROXYL covalently attached to peptides where each one of the nine residues were mutated to Cys, while TOAC-labeled peptides, with TOAC replacing each of the nine residues, were used to monitor backbone properties. Differences in affinity, dynamics, and polarity were found to depend on the spin probe position: while the side chains mobility was strongly restricted at the ends of the peptide, the central region was flexible, suggesting a central bulge. DEER experiments on doubly-labeled peptides where one PROXYL label was placed at position 8 and the second at position 2, 4, or 6, allowed the determination of interspin distances in order to derive the conformations of TAP-bound peptides. Spectral simulations based on a rotamer library led to the conclusion that peptides bind to TAP in an extended kinked structure, similar to that found for peptides bound to MHC class I proteins. Several approaches were employed to address the role of apoprotein E (apoE) isoforms in the mechanism of development of Alzheimer’s disease, since the interaction between apoE3 and the amyloid β peptide (Aβ) is proposed to be involved in the process of Aβ misfolding and aggregation (Petrlova et al.  2011 ). Among these approaches, an analogue where TOAC replaced Ser 26  in the 40-residue peptide (TOAC 26 -Aβ) was synthesized that displayed oligomerization and toxic properties similar to those of the native peptide. EPR spectra of the labeled peptide were obtained for the monomeric and oligomeric forms, the latter reporting a higher degree of probe immobilization. The spectra were simulated making use of the NLSL software (Budil et al.  1996 ) and showed an increase in rotational correlation time of ca. 6 times upon oligomerization. In order to avoid spin–spin interactions, oligomers were prepared where the labeled peptide was diluted by the addition of native Aβ at a 1:3 proportion. EPR spectra of monomeric TOAC 26 -Aβ showed a higher affinity for apoE3 than for apoE4. The apoE-Aβ interaction was also examined by analysis of EPR spectra of different apoE site-directed spin-labeled isoforms, as well as by means of surface plasmon resonance, yielding similar conclusions. An even more recent very promising approach is the use of TOAC-labeled peptides in paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) experiments to obtain information about the distances between TOAC and amino acids in a protein to which the labeled peptide is bound, allowing the determination of the structure of the complex. The advantage of using TOAC lies in the fact that its rigid structure restricts the region of interaction, decreasing averaging effects and yielding better-defined distances (Lindfors et al.  2008 ; Su and Otting  2010 ; Keizers and Ubbink  2011 ). This approach was used for the first time by Lindfors et al. ( 2008 ) to examine the interaction between TOAC-labeled nonapeptides derived from focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of Src kinase. When TOAC replaced a residue located in the peptide binding motif, this caused a substantial decrease of the binding affinity. In contrast, when TOAC was placed just outside the binding motif, the binding constant was essentially unaffected. It was found that, although the SH3 domain binds weakly and transiently to Pro-rich peptides from FAK, the interaction is not very dynamic and the relative position of the spin label to the protein is well defined. Antibodies have a wide range of biological and biotechnical applications. Selective interaction with an epitope is known to be crucial and to depend on paratope conformation. Mangels et al. ( 2010 ) applied PRE NMR spectroscopy to determine the orientation of helix 1 of the prion protein, which is the epitope for the therapeutically active anti-prion scF(v) fragment W226. For this purpose, the peptide fragment W226 was labeled with TOAC and PRE experiments were performed to elucidate the structure of the paratope-epitope interface. Use of TOAC EPR spectra to monitor and improve solid phase peptide synthesis The first studies of the applications of EPR to TOAC-labeled peptidyl-resins were reported about two decades ago (Nakaie et al.  1988 ,  1990 ) and were extended to focus the dynamics of the polymer matrix through the determination of the mobility of peptide chains in the resin bead as a function of solvent. Cilli et al. ( 1997 ) introduced an EPR approach to monitor peptide chain aggregation inside resin beads. In this work, for the first time in peptide synthesis, EPR spectroscopy allowed the detection of different degrees of chain aggregation as a function of solvent and resin loading. Differently from NMR or FT-IR spectra, which reflected the solvation of the whole peptide chain in the bead, the EPR method allowed estimation of the chain aggregation/accessibility in the N-terminal region, where the extent of steric hindrance is critical for the success of the synthetic process. Later, Cilli et al. ( 1999 ) studied the strongly aggregating VVLGAAIV and ING sequences in benzhydrylamine resin with different amino group contents to evaluate the extent of chain association within the beads. The model peptidyl-resins were first labeled with Fmoc-TOAC at their N-terminus and their solvation properties in different solvents were evaluated. This work, as well as the studies of Marchetto et al. ( 2005 ) and Nakaie et al. ( 2006 ), demonstrated the possibility of correlating EPR spectral parameters with different factors that govern polymer-supported reactions during synthesis. The effect of temperature (Ribeiro et al.  2001 ) and of amino acid side chains protecting groups (Cilli et al.  2007 ) on chain dynamics inside resin beads were also monitored by EPR. Another study focused on a very hydrophobic 34-residue peptide (TM-34, CTVAEIYLGNLAGADLILASGLPFWAITIANNFD) which corresponds to a transmembrane segment (residues 69–97) of the rat B2 BK receptor. Due to the difficulty in synthesizing and purifying TM-34, Oliveira et al. ( 2002 ) investigated the association properties of shorter peptides from this sequence. The work focused on peptide-resin solvation/swelling (measurement of bead size), chain mobility (assessed by means of EPR spectra of TOAC-labeled peptidyl-resin), and the kinetics of the coupling reaction. The use of TOAC EPR spectra to investigate how physicochemical conditions influence the efficacy of peptide synthesis within polymer beads proved to be a powerful tool for the achievement of a fundamental goal in this field, namely, the improvement of the yield of synthesis. Concluding remarks The introduction of TOAC represented a new approach for EPR studies of peptides where this unnatural paramagnetic amino acid can be linked to the peptide backbone via a peptide bond. In view of TOAC’s rigid cyclic structure, studies of backbone dynamics are not influenced by rotations of bonds in side chain residues, or those between side chains and the nitroxide group in side chain-attached spin labels. Studies making use of TOAC have yielded a wealth of information about the structural and dynamical aspects of synthetic and biologically active peptides. The combined use of a variety of physical techniques in studies of TOAC-containing peptides has contributed to the understanding of the conformational properties of these molecules, and, therefore, their function. The use of TOAC has shed light on the role of important physicochemical parameters for the improvement of peptide synthesis. New approaches have appeared, such as paramagnetic enhanced relaxation NMR, where the rigid attachment of TOAC to the peptide backbone allows more precise determination of distances for the mapping of peptide-protein complexes. It is foreseeable that other novel approaches will expand the fields of TOAC applications in the future. </Body>

    <Abstact>The global public health threat of antimicrobial resistance has led the scientific community to highly engage into research on alternative strategies to the traditional small molecule therapeutics. Here, we review one of the most popular alternatives amongst basic and applied research scientists, synthetic antimicrobial peptides. The ease of peptide chemical synthesis combined with emerging engineering principles and potent broad-spectrum activity, including against multidrug-resistant strains, has motivated intense scientific focus on these compounds for the past decade. This global effort has resulted in significant advances in our understanding of peptide antimicrobial activity at the molecular scale. Recent evidence of molecular targets other than the microbial lipid membrane, and efforts towards consensus antimicrobial peptide motifs, have supported the rise of molecular engineering approaches and design tools, including machine learning. Beyond molecular concepts, supramolecular chemistry has been lately added to the debate; and helped unravel the impact of peptide self-assembly on activity, including on biofilms and secondary targets, while providing new directions in pharmaceutical formulation through taking advantage of peptide self-assembled nanostructures. We argue that these basic research advances constitute a solid basis for promising industry translation of rationally designed synthetic peptide antimicrobials, not only as novel drugs against multidrug-resistant strains but also as components of emerging antimicrobial biomaterials. This perspective is supported by recent developments of innovative peptide-based and peptide-carrier nanobiomaterials that we also review.</Abstact>
    <Body>Background: the antibiotic resistance global threat and current molecular design approaches Historical perspective The first documented failure of antimicrobial therapy in humans due to acquired microbial resistance was reported in the 1940s for penicillin, which occurred only a few years after its commercialisation (Wright  2010 ). The therapeutic revolution initiated by penicillin motivated the discovery of varied molecular design approaches in the following few decades (Table  1 ).

Despite these early discoveries, it was only after the 1960s that global interest and research efforts were devoted to antimicrobial peptides, due to the rise of multidrug-resistant microbial pathogens. Presently, over 5000 AMPs have been reported (Zhang and Gallo  2016 ; Travkova et al.  2017 ). Microbial evolution towards acquiring resistance to marketed drugs kept increasing over the twentieth century and early twenty-first century (Ventola  2015a ; Aslam et al.  2018 ; Kennedy and Read  2018 ; Peterson and Kaur  2018 ). Decades of fundamental research unravelled four main types of molecular resistance mechanisms: secretion of inactivating enzymes, secretion of efflux pumps, immunity and bypass, and target modification. A number of excellent reviews have compiled these mechanisms for the antimicrobial agents currently on the market (Table  1 , Fig.  1 ) (Davies and Davies  2010 ; Malmir et al.  2018 ; Ribeiro da Cunha et al.  2019 ; Magana et al.  2020 ). Two main factors are identified as favouring the increase of antimicrobial resistance: the generalized use and misuse of antimicrobial therapies and the insufficient discovery of new antimicrobial therapies (Table  1 ) (Ventola  2015a ; Aslam et al.  2018 ; Kennedy and Read  2018 ; Peterson and Kaur  2018 ). Fig. 1 Main molecular mechanisms of action and resistance for marketed antibiotics. Modified from Wright  2010 Worldwide, numerous organizations, like the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the World Economic Forum, and the World Health Organization (WHO) have recognized antibiotic resistance as a “global public health concern”. Numerous attempts have been made to delineate the diverse aspects of antibiotic resistance (Li et al.  2012 ; Crofts et al.  2017 ; Sierra et al.  2017 ). WHO published several documents to guide the development of new antimicrobials, such as the list of global priority pathogens and corresponding target diseases (WHO  2017 ). In 2015, WHO launched the Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) as the first global system to collect official national antimicrobial resistance data in selected bacterial pathogens (WHO  2015 ). In a span of 4 years, 91 countries and territories had already enrolled in the system. Based on worldwide data, the GLASS report of May 2020 revealed a worrying number of common bacterial infections increasingly resistant to available antibiotics (WHO  2020b ). Recently, concerns have been raised regarding an aggravation of the inappropriate use of antibiotics during the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, the WHO issued guidance to “NOT recommend antibiotic therapy or prophylaxis for patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 unless signs and symptoms of a bacterial infection exist” (Getahun et al.  2020 ). Global priority pathogens and infectious diseases The WHO priority list contains 12 bacterial families, including the ESKAPE pathogens ( Enterococcus faecium ,  Staphylococcus aureus ,  Klebsiella pneumoniae ,  Acinetobacter baumannii ,  Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and  Enterobacter species ), which are known to represent a global threat to human health (WHO  2017 ). Mycobacteria was not included in the catalogue, because it is already considered a global priority for which innovative new treatments are urgently needed. The main objective of the list was to identify the most important resistant bacteria at a global level for which there is an urgent need for new treatments, in order to encourage the prioritisation of funding and incentives, to align research and development priorities of public health and to garner global coordination in the fight against those pathogens. The WHO priority pathogens were selected through a multi-criteria decision analysis technique contemplating both expert opinion and evidence-based data, following ten criteria: all-cause mortality, healthcare and community burden, prevalence of resistance, 10-year trend of resistance, transmissibility, preventability in hospital and community settings, treatability and current pipeline (Santajit and Indrawattana  2016 ; WHO  2017 ; Parish  2019 ; De Oliveira et al.  2020 ). In May 2020, WHO released a report comprising the target product profiles (TTP) for needed antimicrobial agents for priority diseases, namely enteric fever, gonorrhoea, neonatal sepsis, and urinary tract infections. Table  2  compiles the diseases considered as priority targets, together with their available treatments and reported antimicrobial resistance (WHO  2020c ). Table 2 Available treatment and reported antimicrobial resistance for enteric fever, gonorrhoea, neonatal sepsis, and urinary tract infections. Adapted from WHO (WHO  2020c ) Disease Pathogen Antibiotic resistance Available treatment Enteric fever Salmonella typhi  or  Salmonella paratyphi Resistant to all major antibiotic categories (varies upon the region) Asia: ciprofloxacin resistance in  S. typhi  or  S. paratyphi  is close to 100% 1) Ampicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and fluoroquinolones (not effective in many regions) 2) Cefixime, azithromycin and ceftriaxone 3) Extra resistant strains: azithromycin and carbapenems Gonorrhoea Neisseria gonorrhoeae Resistance to all oral antimicrobials used for treatment: sulphonamides, penicillins, tetracyclines, macrolides and fluoroquinolones 1) Ceftriaxone and azithromycin (resistance has been reported) Neonatal sepsis Most common: E coli, Klebsiella  sp ., Acinetobacter  sp. , P aeruginosa, S aureus Varies 1) Ampicillin or penicillin in combination with gentamicin (resistance has been reported) Urinary tract infections Most common:  E coli ,  K pneumoniae ,  Enterobacteriaceae Fluoroquinolones.

This list is programmed to be launched at the end of 2021 with the main purpose of defining R&amp;D priorities with identified public health needs. In April 2020, a first meeting of the WHO antifungal expert group took place to establish the parameters for pathogen selection. The priority fungal pathogens initially set out include:  Candida auris; azole-resistant Candida  spp. ;  azole-resistant  Aspergillus fumigatus; Cryptococcus neoformans ,  Cryptococcus gattii ;  Pneumocystis jirovecii  and  Mucorales . Further evaluation will be made based on limitations of treatment options due to resistance and/or existing treatability issues for those pathogens (WHO  2020a ). Molecular design approaches in the pre-clinical and clinical pipelines Since the publication of the first priority list by WHO in 2017 and until September 2019, eight new antibiotics were approved by the US and European authorities (FDA/EMA) with activity against the priority pathogens. However, most of these products are not very innovative, being derivatives of known classes, such as the tetracycline derivatives eravacycline, omadacycline, or sarecyclin, the cephalosporin derivative cefiderocol and the combination therapy imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam. Sarecycline is indicated for moderate to severe acne caused by Cutibacterium acnes while the combination therapy imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam and cefiderocol were approved for complicated urinary tract infections (Andrei et al.  2019 ; EMA  2020 ; FDA  2020 ). As of September 2019, the WHO listed 49 small molecules and 10 biological molecules in clinical development that target priority pathogens,  Mycobacterium tuberculosis  and  Clostridium difficile . Besides this high number, only six of these therapies did not display cross-resistance to existing antibiotics and between those six only two were active against multidrug-resistant Gram negative bacteria. This can be explained by the general lack of chemical diversity. Indeed, most of the new antimicrobial small molecules in clinical trials are combinatory therapies of beta lactams with beta-lactamase inhibitors or tetracycline derivatives. The six innovative small molecule antibiotics include two boronate beta-lactam inhibitors (taniborbactam-cefepime and VNRX-7145—ceftibuten), two new topoisomerase inhibitors (zoliflodacin and gepotidacin), a new FabI inhibitor (afabicin), and a FtsZ inhibitor (TXA709) (WHO  2019a ). Antimicrobial biological medicines in clinical development include mono/polyclonal antibodies and endolysins, which all can be considered innovative, as they target new structures through new modes of action (classes: anti- Staphylococcus aureus  immunoglobulin M (IgM) monoclonal antibody; anti- Staphylococcus aureus  IgG monoclonal antibody; phage endolysin; anti- Pseudomonas aeruginosa  IgG monoclonal antibody; anti- Pseudomonas aeruginosa  serotype O11 IgG monoclonal antibody; anti- Staphylococcus aureus  IgG monoclonal antibody; anti- Staphylococcus aureus  IgG monoclonal antibody; anti- Clostridium difficile  polyclonal antibody). However, the high cost of biologicals compared to small molecules limits their potential use as alternative treatments to current therapies (Peterson and Kaur  2018 ; WHO  2019a ). The first comprehensive global overview of the antibacterial pre-clinical pipeline was published by the WHO in 2019, compiling 252 antibacterial products being developed in 145 institutions around the world. The review identified relatively innovative products, with many projects including direct-acting small molecules ( n  = 108, 42.9%), antimicrobial peptides ( n  = 27, 10.7%), and phage/phage-derived peptides ( n  = 28, 11.1%) (WHO  2019b ). Considering the WHO priority pathogens list, examination of the pre-clinical pipeline projects indicates that a significant number of products were focused on single pathogenic species, representing a consistent shift rather than broader spectrum agents. Almost one-third of these products target bacterial cell wall synthesis or directly act on the bacterial membrane because of the less likely occurrence of resistance to these mechanisms of action (Kennedy and Read  2018 ). However, for these new non-traditional approaches, the failure rate in clinical trials is considerably higher than that of proven pathways for new agents of existing antibiotic classes. Finding innovative antimicrobial entities is scientifically complex and less successful than drug discovery in other fields. The challenges include (i) in order to avoid single-step resistance, find compounds that have more than one binding site; (ii) discover molecules that penetrate the outer layers of Gram negative cell walls without being pumped out immediately by efflux pumps; and (iii) overcome toxicity problems due to the usual high concentrations of the antimicrobials required to kill bacteria (Ventola  2015b ; Kennedy and Read  2018 ; Peterson and Kaur  2018 ). Antimicrobial drug discovery: latest approaches Historically, the most successful means of antibacterial discovery have been the screening of natural products obtained from microbial sources. To date, most of the antibiotics available on the market are natural or semi-synthetic/synthetic compounds derived from natural molecules (Simmons et al.  2010 ; Renwick et al.  2016 ; Parish  2019 ). Several approaches can be employed in the discovery of natural antimicrobials, such as diversity-based approaches (culturing the “uncultured” bacteria; co-culture; examine rare bacterial taxa and unusual habitats), ribosome engineering, genetic engineering, and genome mining, as developed below (Goodfellow and Fiedler  2010 ; Renwick et al.  2016 ; Wohlleben et al.  2016 ). These approaches are supported by recent advances in computational models and combinatorial chemistry to rationally discover new drugs and improve current antimicrobials (Pucci  2006 ; Simmons et al.  2010 ; Renwick et al.  2016 ; Blaskovich et al.  2017 ). Natural antibiotics discovery: diversity-based approaches Less than 1% of the microbes present in the environment can be cultivated in the laboratory. In support of the global effort to cultivate new microbial taxa, nutrient media and diffusion chambers have been successfully used in high-throughput cultivation for several microbes such as marine isolates (Amann et al.  1995 ; Nichols et al.  2010 ; Wohlleben et al.  2016 ). Soil  Actinomycetes , particularly  Streptomyces  species, have been the source of most natural antibiotics in use nowadays. In recent years, after decades of exploiting terrestrial  Streptomycetes , the search has shifted to rare  Actinomycetes  and other taxa of bacteria such as  Cyanobacteria  and  Proteobacteria . Novel  Actinomycetes  species and their novel natural products have been discovered in deep ocean sediments, hyper-arid desert soils, and hot springs to name a few unusual habitats. Endophytic bacteria present in plant tissues and plant rhizospheres, and symbiotic bacteria such as the actinobacteria living in mutualistic association with fungal growing attine ants, bacterial-nematode associations, or even human commensals are being sourced for novel antibiotics. Goodfellow and Fiedler have outlined a bioprospecting strategy where species from extreme or unusual habitats are cultivated with selective isolation methods, novel taxa are recognized by dereplication, and then screened for natural products (Hosaka et al.  2009 ; Goodfellow and Fiedler  2010 ; Wohlleben et al.  2016 ). In the environment, microorganisms are rarely found in isolation. Several reports have shown that microorganisms that grow in co-culture with another species result in induction of antibiotic production, often related to previously silent gene clusters. Co-cultures can induce silent antibiotic genes because of competition (Hosaka et al.  2009 ; Wohlleben et al.  2016 ). Ribosome engineering, genetic engineering and genome mining Ribosome engineering is an approach to discover microbes with spontaneous mutations in their ribosome or RNA polymerase, through screening antibiotic-resistant mutants. Some selected mutants may have elevated secondary metabolite production or produce new series of natural products with interesting biological activities. A simple way to introduce ribosomal mutations is by exposing strains to aminoglycoside antibiotics. Strains that become resistant to these antibiotics harbour mutations in the ribosome. Resistance to other ribosome targeting antibiotics such as gentamicin or erythromycin could also stimulate antibiotic production (Hosaka et al.  2009 ; Zhu et al.  2019 ). Eliminating genes for one secondary metabolite can stimulate the production of silent pathways. This was verified when ten new amexanthomycins were produced after the deletion of rifamycin synthesis genes in the  Amycolatopsis mediterranei . Furthermore, by introducing or altering the expression of a heterologous global regulator, the secondary metabolome can change unpredictably. Many biosynthetic gene clusters include pathway-specific regulators that when overexpressed can increase the yield of the natural product or stimulate a previously silent cluster (e.g., production of stambomycin by  Streptomyces ambofaciens ) (Laureti et al.  2011 ; Li et al.  2018 ; Rajeev  2018 ). Genome mining can be applied to predict the synthesis of new compounds. Genes synthesizing natural products are contained in biosynthetic gene clusters. Those clusters are modular, following an assembly line method with the number of modules correlating to the number of molecular building blocks incorporated in the product. Normally, there is a core cluster that models the product and adjacent genes that change the product such as acyltransferases and genes that confer self-resistance (Blin et al.  2017 ; Rajeev  2018 ). Genome mining tools can connect biosynthetic gene clusters to their corresponding natural products, being empowered to find the accessory tailoring domains and use the information to predict structural features and physicochemical properties of the final product. The most important of these are PRISM (PRediction Informatics for Secondary Metabolomes) (Skinnider et al.  2017 ) and antiSMASH (antibiotics and Secondary Metabolite Analysis SHell) (Blin et al.  2017 ; Rajeev  2018 ). Those computational tools can foresee the number of biosynthetic gene clusters in a selected genome and the structures of the natural products. Other important tools which are restricted to peptide natural products are Pep2Path (Medema et al.  2014 ), NRPQuest (for non-ribosomal peptides) (Mohimani et al.  2014a ) and RiPPQuest (for ribosomal peptides) (Mohimani et al.  2014b ). Bioactive-guided screening and target-based drug discovery Two main principles have been applied as the basis for effective drug discovery programmes: (i) target-oriented screening: aiming to identify compounds that are compatible with a known and validated molecular target; (ii) bioactive-guided screening: after the identification of the active substance, efforts are made to analyse the target and the mode of action of the compound (Goodfellow and Fiedler  2010 ; Jackson et al.  2018 ; Parish  2019 ). Target-based drug discovery has a great potential. This approach starts with identifying compounds or pathways that are essential to the pathogen. Genome sequencing can help to identify unique targets specific to bacteria, providing high specificity over human cells, and targets can be selected that are either common to all bacteria or specific to certain species. After selection of the target, they are characterized, validated and screened against a panel of small molecules or chemical libraries to identify those that affect them. Then, the selected molecules are evaluated for their suitability as drugs (low toxicity, good bacterial penetration and bioavailability) and later attempts are made to improve their potency and pharmacokinetic properties (Simmons et al.  2010 ; Parish  2019 ). Structure-based drug discovery (SBDD) is an example for target-based drug discovery. An antimicrobial drug target should be essential have a unique function in the pathogen and exhibit an activity that can be altered by a small molecule. After, protocols for high-throughput screening and de novo design are used to establish new drugs and their antimicrobial structure–activity relationship (Simmons et al.  2010 ). Antimicrobial peptides as promising new drugs Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small proteins usually composed of up to 50 amino acid residues, which, depending on their composition, size and conformation, can be arranged in different groups such as cationic peptides (largest), non-cationic peptides, aromatic peptides or those derived from oxygen-binding proteins (Vizioli and Salzet  2002 ). Apart from the peptide charge, the features mentioned above may be essential for their antimicrobial activity (Friedrich et al.  2000 ). AMPs have exhibited broad-spectrum activity against many Gram negative and Gram positive strains as well as fungi (Chung and Khanum  2017 ) and are produced by both animals and plants (Zasloff  2002 ). They have been used for the treatment of Candidiasis (Danesi et al.  2002 ) and have also been useful against replication of HIV1 by eliminating viral gene expression (Wachinger et al.  1998 ). Antimicrobial peptides are part of the innate immune defence of organisms (Peschel and Sahl  2006 ); they may present antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasitic and antiviral activity (Hancock and Diamond  2000 ). They are one of the strategies used by leukocytes to kill microorganisms after being ingested (Otto  2010 ). AMPs also have a signalling function and can activate immune cells (Yang et al.  1999 ). AMPs bind to the anionic bacterial surface and can integrate into the cytoplasmic membrane, making pores to kill the microorganism, since most of them are cationic (CAMPs) and show amphipathic properties (Brown and Hancock  2006 ). In humans, most AMPs belong to the beta defensin family (Ganz  2003 ) while the LL-37 peptide belongs to the cathelicidin family (Dürr et al.  2006 ). Most of the naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides have rather long sequences, which can compromise their application as commercial drugs due to the high cost of protein production at industrial scale. Hence, research is focussing on identifying short active fragments as a base to develop new AMPs, using a range of molecular engineering strategies, which are the topic of this review. Short AMPs represent a chemical class of promising new drugs due to their robust biomimetic mechanisms of action, their relative ease of synthesis, and low production cost when compared to biologicals. With a clearer understanding of AMP pharmacokinetics and structural biology, these peptides are increasingly gaining attention as therapeutic agents (da Costa et al.  2015 ; Magana et al.  2020 ; Mookherjee et al.  2020 ). Molecular targets and mechanisms of action involved in peptide antimicrobial activity The bactericidal and/or bacteriostatic activity of AMPs primarily depends upon their ability to interact with bacterial membranes or cell walls, as a direct cell death mechanism or means to reach intracellular targets (Kang et al.  2014 ; da Costa et al.  2015 ; Zhang and Gallo  2016 ; Le et al.  2017 ; Mookherjee et al.  2020 ). Mechanisms of action that target the microbial membrane are amongst the preferred ones to develop new agents, as less likely to engender resistance (Kennedy and Read  2018 ). For these reasons, the interactions of antimicrobial peptides with the microbial lipid membrane have been the focus of intense research, with molecular mechanisms being unravelled. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are other essential components of the Gram negative bacterial cell membrane. Given the negative charge of LPS, cationic AMPs strongly interact with these compounds, which constitute another antimicrobial target of choice. Interestingly, immunomodulatory activity has been reported through the interaction of AMPs with LPS, and also with microbial nucleic acids or other immune ligands. Various microbial intracellular targets are emerging from fundamental research, with growing evidence that potent AMPs target multiple functions. Bacterial biofilms recently gained attention as extracellular AMP targets to prevent infection spread. Lipid membrane Lipid membrane disruption Several modes of action have been suggested for bacterial membrane disruption by peptides, including carpet, barrel-stave, toroidal pore formations and aggregate mechanism (Chan et al.  2006 ; Kang et al.  2014 ; Bechinger and Gorr  2017 ; Nagarajan et al.  2018 ; Mookherjee et al.  2020 ) (Fig.  2 ). In the carpet model, the peptides align and accumulate parallel to the surface of the membrane until they reach a critical concentration, leading to changes in the membrane fluidity and/or reduction in membrane barrier properties resulting in membrane permeabilization. The membrane is disrupted in a detergent-like way, with no need of peptide insertion into the hydrophobic core of the bilayer. For the barrel-stave model, peptides interact laterally, resulting in the formation of a structure that behaves like a protein ion channel. In the toroidal pore model, the peptides interact only with the head groups of the lipids, affecting the local curvature of the membrane and resulting in the formation of high curvature peptide-lipid toroids. Another model is the aggregate mechanism, when peptides cross the membrane without causing significant membrane disruption. Once inside the cell, AMPs aim at intracellular targets (da Costa et al.  2015 ; Le et al.  2017 ; Mookherjee et al.  2020 ). Fig. 2 Membrane disruption molecular models and some intracellular targets of AMPs. Reproduced from Mookherjee et al.  2020 .  Copyright © 2020, Springer Nature Limited Negative Gaussian curvature model A body of research has focussed on the link between the mechanism of action of AMPs and the ability of these peptides to generate negative Gaussian curvature (or saddle-splay curvature) in the bacterial membrane, which is known to destabilize the membrane (Schmidt et al.  2011 ; Schmidt and Wong  2013 ; Lee et al.  2016 ). This effect is strongly linked to the membrane lipid composition—the presence of anionic lipids, and lipids of intrinsic negative curvature including phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-based lipids and cardiolipin increase the susceptibility to AMPs (Som et al.  2009 ; Schmidt et al.  2011 ). PE is the main phospholipid found in the plasma membrane of Gram negative bacteria. It has been shown that the presence of these negative curvature lipids may reduce the energy required to form membrane pores associated with disruption of the bilayer by AMPs (Zimmerberg and Kozlov  2006 ). In contrast, cholesterol, which is more typical of eukaryotic membranes and acts to rigidify the lipid bilayer, appears to inhibit the effect of AMPs (Verly et al.  2008 ). The role of negative Gaussian curvature in the AMP mechanism of action has also been demonstrated using peptide-mimicking phenylene ethynylenes (Yang et al.  2008 ). The ability of these compounds to induce permeation in bacterial membranes was again shown to require the presence of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-based lipids, which promote negative Gaussian curvature in membranes. A mutant PE-knockout strain of  E. coli  was shown to out-survive the wild type strain following addition of phenylene ethynylenes (Yang et al.  2008 ). Lee et al. used a machine learning approach to predict whether a series of membrane-permeating α-helical peptides of various sequence homologies were likely to be antimicrobial (Lee et al.  2016 ). Sequence homologies were restricted to peptides 20–25 residues in length, with homology to known AMPs, and high α-helical content. A support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier was used to generate a metric σ based on the distance from the SVM hyperplane—this metric was not correlated with the peptide’s minimum inhibitory concentration, but instead with the ability of the peptide to generate negative Gaussian curvature in a lipid membrane. Small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments on unilamellar vesicles following the addition of selected peptides showed the formation of coexisting bicontinuous cubic lipid phases of Pn3m and Im3m symmetry. These phases are based around a fundamental lipid bilayer structure with a non-positive Gaussian curvature (although they maintain zero mean curvature) (Lee et al.  2016 ). Peptide secondary structure and membrane activity Membrane active AMPs comprise peptides of varied secondary structures commonly classified into α-helical, β-sheet, or unstructured (random coil) conformations .  Examples of α-helical antimicrobial peptides include magainin, temporins and melittin, which undergo a conformational change from unstructured in solution to an amphipathic helix when in interaction with the lipid membrane. All these peptides are cationic and disrupt the membrane of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. They also exhibit activity against fungal species (Lombardi et al.  2019 ). Membrane active β-sheet antimicrobial peptides can already be structured in solution, due to rigid conformations eventually stabilised by disulphide bridges, as for instance the natural host defense peptides defensins and their designed synthetic cyclic derivatives (Scudiero et al.  2015 ). Pioneering work by Ghadiri’s group showed that de novo designed cyclic D,L-peptides can form pores within membranes and exert antimicrobial activity (Fernandez-Lopez et al.  2001 ). Membrane active unstructured/extended antimicrobial peptides can adopt an amphipathic fold within membranes to induce disruption or simply be translocated to the intracellular space. The activity of such AMPs generally involves intracellular targets via specific amino acid motifs, including proline-rich AMPs originated from insects, or tryptophan and arginine rich peptides such as indolicidin (Le et al.  2017 ). Toxicity: membrane composition selectivity Due to differences in the membrane composition of different microbes/organism and cell types (Table  3 ), most AMPs can be cell-selective, by discriminating between the target membranes. Table 3 Major membrane lipids for bacterial, fungal and mammalian cell types Cell type Major membrane lipids References Bacterial Phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) (Shrestha et al.  2013 ; John et al.  2017 ; Travkova et al.  2017 ; Nielsen et al.  2018 ) Fungal Phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamines (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI) and ergosterol. (Cho et al.  2013 ; Shrestha et al.  2013 ) Mammalian Phosphatidylcholine (PC) and cholesterol (Shrestha et al.  2013 ; John et al.  2017 ; Travkova et al.  2017 ) Membrane selectivity is governed by phospholipid composition and the resulting net charge of the membrane (Yeaman and Yount  2003 ), parameters which can differ significantly between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Though not always the case, significant levels of antibacterial activity are achievable with minimal haemolysis and cytotoxicity, resulting in a high therapeutic index, which can be gauged by the ratio of minimum haemolytic concentration (MHC) to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Numerous studies have found that antimicrobial peptide charge (which is typically cationic) plays a considerable role in the mechanism through which AMPs achieve cell selectivity. In mammalian cells, the outer lipid leaflet is typically comprised of zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin species, with anionic lipids distributed asymmetrically within the inner leaflet (Verkleij et al.  1973 ). In contrast, bacterial cell membranes contain an abundance of anionic phospholipids such as phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin. Other structural molecules, such as the negatively charged lipopolysaccharides in Gram negative bacteria, and teichoic acids in Gram positive bacteria, further contribute to the net negative charge of bacterial cell membranes. As a result, electrostatic interactions lead to preferential binding between AMPs and bacterial membranes (Christensen et al.  1988 ; Matsuzaki et al.  1997 ; Silvestro et al.  1997 ). However, significant differences in a given peptide’s antimicrobial activity are observed when assayed against different bacterial species, pointing to separate mechanisms beyond simple membrane charge. Aside from fundamental structural differences between species, several studies have indicated that amongst anionic phospholipids, head group structure and hydrocarbon chain length further regulate peptide-membrane interactions. As assessed via DSC, the AMP protegrin-1 was found to influence the thermotropic phase behaviour of exposed DPPG vesicles significantly more than those comprised of DPPA, despite net negative charge of both lipid species being equal (Jing et al.  2005 ). It was additionally found that while the peptide bound to both DMPG and DSPG liposomes, penetration of protegrin-1 into the hydrophobic region of the bilayer only occurred for DMPG. This second observation was explained by the lipid tail packing, which is tighter in DSPG due to increased van der Waals forces between the longer hydrocarbon chains, resulting in an increased energy barrier for peptide insertion. Further contributing to cell selectivity are the hydrophobic interactions occurring between the hydrophobic portions of amphipathic peptides and the cell membrane. It has been demonstrated that peptides with high MHC values exhibit strong interactions with membranes comprised of the zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine, while non-haemolytic peptides do not. With increasing insight into the parameters responsible for activity and selectivity, attempts have been made to modify or engineer existing antimicrobial peptides, with an aim to increase efficacy. It has been noted that increases in cationic charge up to approximately + 10 increase antimicrobial activity with minimal impact on haemolytic activity (Zelezetsky and Tossi  2006 ). The effect on antimicrobial and haemolytic activity of peptide hydrophobicity, hydrophobic moment and angle subtended by the positively charged helix face were examined by Dathe et al. using a series of magainin and model peptides (Dathe et al.  1997 ). It was found that increases in each of these three parameters increased both activity against Gram positive bacteria and haemolytic activity to a similar extent. It was suggested that such increases in activity were driven by hydrophobic peptide–membrane interactions, particularly given that the erythrocyte membrane is largely comprised of zwitterionic PC and PE phospholipids. MIC values for the Gram positive  S. aureus  remained below the EC50 for haemolysis, and the model KLA peptides (+ 6 net charge) displayed lower MICs than magainins (+ 4 net charge), indicating that Gram positive activity remains dependent on peptide charge as well (Dathe et al.  1997 ). Activity against Gram negative bacteria showed little change as these parameters were altered, and it was reasoned that Gram negative activity was governed predominantly by electrostatic interactions. This observation would appear to explain the prokaryotic specificity of magainin, while more hydrophobic AMPs such as melittin exhibit activity against both bacterial and mammalian cell membranes (Dathe et al.  1997 ). If one considers the action of AMPs as a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with a membrane, then for more neutral membranes, where electrostatic peptide-lipid interactions are minimized, the hydrophobic effect plays a more predominant role regarding host cell toxicity. Hydrophobicity is an essential feature for AMP-membrane interactions. However, the increase of the hydrophobic interaction is strongly correlated with mammalian cell toxicity and loss of antimicrobial specificity. Therefore, many AMPs are moderately hydrophobic, to optimise selective toxicity towards microbial cell membranes. Selective antimicrobial activity results from a delicate balance of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions between an antimicrobial peptide and the targeted membrane (Giuliani and Rinaldi  2011 ; Kang et al.  2014 ; Ong et al.  2014 ; Sierra et al.  2017 ). Other cellular targets: lipopolysaccharides and intracellular targets Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are hallmark components of Gram negative bacteria outer membranes. LPS can be described as containing a lipid domain (lipid A or endotoxin) covalently bound to a “core” oligosaccharide and an antigen polysaccharide (O-antigen). Endotoxins exhibit pro-inflammatory activity via binding to innate immunity receptors, the Toll-like receptors present in animal immune cells. Hence, targeting LPS can result in Gram negative bactericidal activity via outer membrane destabilisation and in reducing endotoxin activity (Raetz and Whitfield  2002 ). Given the LPS amphipathic nature and negative charge, cationic amphipathic peptides are expected to significantly interact with LPS. This is the case for natural AMPs such as melittin, magainin and protegrin (Ding et al.  2003 ), but also synthetic peptides, which have been shown to destabilise the Gram negative bacterial outer membrane and to exhibit anti-toxin activity (Lakshminarayanan et al.  2016 ; Heinbockel et al.  2018 ). However, endogenous antimicrobial peptides have also been shown to exhibit pro-inflammatory activity by complexation of immune ligands, including LPS and nucleic acids. Indeed, complexes of microbial ligands by endogenous AMPs are currently thought to be potentially immune-stimulant to signal microbial invasion to the immune system (Lee et al.  2019a ). The interplay between the immune system and antimicrobial peptides is complex and is currently being investigated on a case by case basis, with excellent reviews available on the topic (Hilchie et al.  2013 ; Mookherjee et al.  2020 ). Intracellular microbial targets identified for natural AMPs span from binding nucleic acids, the ribosome or protein chaperones, to inhibiting protein metabolism, cell division or cell wall synthesis. Over the past decade, an increasing number of natural AMPs have been shown to inhibit multiple microbial functions (Le et al.  2017 ; Mookherjee et al.  2020 ). For instance, it was evidenced that the short cationic peptide indolicidin, a cathelicidin with high tryptophan and arginine content, induces non-bactericidal membrane permeabilisation and binds intracellular duplex DNA via the peptide motif PWWP to inhibit microbial DNA replication and transcription (Ghosh et al.  2014 ). Although intracellular targets may provide an interesting addition or alternative for the molecular engineering of AMPs, few synthetic peptides have been specifically designed to target such microbial components to date and few of these peptide motifs have been identified (Le et al.  2017 ). Targeting microbial colonies: biofilm components and bacterial adhesion Bacterial biofilms are resilient drug-resistant communities of surface-adhered bacteria encapsulated within a sturdy extracellular matrix that acts as a physical barrier (Dunne Jr.  2002 ). Medical implants such as catheters are often compromised due to the formation of bacterial biofilms on the surface of the device; the rate of biofilm formation being affected by the material of the device (Quirynen and Bollen  1995 ; Garrett et al.  2008 ; Song et al.  2015 ). While this is typically remedied by simply replacing the medical device, an infection forming a resilient biofilm on a more permanent implant such as a prosthetic joint is disastrous. Biofilms may also form on living tissue such as  P. aeruginosa  colonisation of the lungs in immunocompromised cystic fibrosis patients (Lam et al.  1980 ). This is mainly due to the innate resistance of bacterial biofilms to antibiotics and disinfectants (Oie et al.  1996 ). Biofilm formation is also associated with several diseases and medical complications such as diabetic foot ulcer infections (Neut et al.  2011 ), ear infections, and urinary tract infections (Vestby et al.  2020 ). Aside from the cells themselves, microbial biofilms are primarily composed of exopolysaccharides such as the teichoic acids of Gram positive  Staphylococci  and several from Gram negative species such as  P. aeruginosa  (Byrd et al.  2009 ; Colvin et al.  2012 ). These polysaccharides are involved in surface adhesion during the initial stage of biofilm formation (Flemming  1993 ). Proteins and extracellular microbial DNA are also major components of biofilm systems (Whitchurch et al.  2002 ; Flemming and Wingender  2010 ). Exopolysaccharides effect a local environment like that of an extracellular matrix, allowing for microbial cells to remain attached to the surface and resist shear forces (Donlan and Costerton  2002 ). Biofilm-residing microbial cells are less metabolically active than planktonic phase cells, allowing for perseverance in nutrient-deficient environments, and may contribute to higher resistance to antibiotics targeting metabolic pathways (Walters 3rd et al.  2003 ). In bacterial biofilms, the cells participate in communication via quorum sensing (QS) (Li and Tian  2012 ). QS arises from the bacterial generation and detection of signalling molecules called autoinducers (AIs), which are typically acyl homoserine lactones and other compounds biosynthesised from S-adenosylmethionine (Parveen and Cornell  2011 ; Papenfort and Bassler  2016 ). While Gram negative species utilise small molecule AIs, Gram positive bacteria such as  S. aureus  employ cyclic oligopeptides as autoinducer peptides (AIPs), which may be mimicked by synthetic peptides in order to block the quorum sensing pathway and the generation of virulence factors (Mayville et al.  1999 ; Thoendel et al.  2011 ; Zhu and Lau  2011 ). The design of anti-biofilm peptides is a more nuanced approach compared to that of AMP inhibitors of planktonic cells as membrane disruption is not the sole mechanism sought after for anti-biofilm peptides (Sakala and Reches  2018 ; Dostert et al.  2019 ). However, it has been suggested that AMPs are more suitable as anti-biofilm agents compared to traditional antibiotics since the membrane remains a target irrespective of the metabolic state of the cell (Hurdle et al.  2011 ). The downside of this is of course that higher than usual concentrations of AMPs may be required, which may also induce haemolytic or cytotoxic effects. The distinct growth stages of biofilms may be targeted such as by inhibiting bacterial adhesion in the first place or interfering with growth and quorum sensing (Table  4 ).

Similarly, two molecular design approaches supported the interplay between peptide self-assembly and antimicrobial activity: (i) peptide sequences firstly designed to self-assemble into nanostructures, then discovered to exhibit antimicrobial activity; (ii) or the opposite, peptide sequences designed towards antimicrobial activity—essentially by membrane disruption—then discovered to self-assemble into hydrogels and/or supramolecular nanostructures (Tian et al.  2015 ; Shi et al.  2021 ). Although the requirement of amphipathic sequences is an obvious common physicochemical property shared by both molecular designs, the mechanisms of action by which peptide oligomers or nanostructures can damage microbial cells emerged relatively recently. Interestingly, the microbial membrane is not the only target that can be affected by peptide self-assembled species, as reviewed below. Peptide amyloidogenic properties and antimicrobial activity The amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide, which self-assembles into the so-called amyloid nanofibrillar aggregates in the brain of Alzheimer’s disease patients, was shown to exhibit broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi (Soscia et al.  2010 ; Bourgade et al.  2016 ). Unexpectedly, the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide was found to be of equivalent or greater antimicrobial potency as the human host defence peptide LL-37, suggesting unrecognised normal functions of the Aβ peptide in the innate immune response to microbial infections (Soscia et al.  2010 ). Mechanistic studies support that Aβ peptide antimicrobial activity is caused by the formation of ion channels within the microbial membranes, e.g. similar mechanism of action as its toxicity to brain cells (Kagan et al.  2012 ). A number of mechanisms of membrane disruption were unravelled to explain amyloid toxicity towards brain cells, including the insertion of toxic oligomers and membrane interactions with mature nanofibrils (Dharmadana et al.  2017 ). These molecular interactions can be hypothesised to apply to microbial membranes too (Fig.  3 ). Fig. 3 Main models of membrane disruption by amyloid oligomers. Reproduced from Dharmadana et al.  2017 .  Copyright © 2017, The Royal Society Publishing Further supporting a correlation between self-assembly and antimicrobial activity, endogenous antimicrobial proteins and peptides were shown in vitro to undergo self-assembly into amyloid-like nanofibrillar aggregates, e.g. the human peptide LL-37 (Sood et al.  2008 ), protegrin-1 (Jang et al.  2011 ), or human α-defensin peptides (Chairatana et al.  2016 ). Two main mechanisms of action related to self-assembly were identified for these natural AMPs: either microbial membrane permeabilization by cytotoxic oligomers (Sood et al.  2008 ) and/or the entanglement of bacteria within “nanonets” formed by antimicrobial peptide nanostructures (Chairatana et al.  2016 ; Chairatana and Nolan  2017 ), which relates to biofilm targeting. Membrane disruption upon peptide self-assembly A few excellent reviews compile examples of self-assembling synthetic peptides that exhibit antimicrobial activity (Tian et al.  2015 ; Malekkhaiat Häffner and Malmsten  2018 ; Lombardi et al.  2019 ; Shi et al.  2021 ). The large majority of systems are amphipathic cationic peptides that affect the microbial membrane, either by lipid phase destabilisation or pore formation, eventually leading to cell lysis and death. In most cases, the peptide amphipathic design is responsible for intrinsic self-assembly, while hydrophobic and cationic charges ensure interactions with phospholipids and membrane insertion leading to antimicrobial activity. Hence, the amphipathic cationic design is sufficient to drive self-assembly while ensuring activity. By introducing rational variations in the amphipathic design in a single peptide system, various research groups succeeded in fine-tuning self-assembly into supramolecular structures of different morphologies and/or hydrogels while conserving antimicrobial activity (Shi et al.  2021 ). Recently, Gazit et al. exploited the self-assembly of the Phe-Phe dipeptide into precipitated nanotubes to create solid nanotube arrays on surfaces. Such nanostructured surfaces exhibit antibacterial activity by mechanical disruption of the bacterial membrane (Schnaider et al.  2017 ). This mechanism is directly inspired from the natural antibacterial properties of micro-spikes on dragonfly wings, which paved the way to diverse research on antimicrobial nanostructured surfaces of various chemical compositions (Elbourne et al.  2017 ). Few studies report on the direct characterisation of bacterial membrane disruption of monomeric versus self-assembled peptides for comparable sequences. Although one would expect synergy between self-assembly and membrane disruption, current reports support subtlety and system specificity of this structure-function relationship. For instance, rationally designed cationic amphipathic “multidomain peptides” (MDPs) self-assemble into nanofibers, which have been shown to directly interact with lipid membranes as assembled peptides. However, when the nanofibers form hydrogels, antimicrobial activity is affected by rheological properties (Jiang et al.  2015 ). Interestingly, the same group reported an increase in melittin selective toxicity towards model bacterial membranes over mammalian membranes when assembled on MDP nanofibers. This result was assigned to the different conformations adopted by melittin in its monomeric and assembled forms when presented to the lipid membrane (Chen et al.  2019 ). Another example is the rationally designed family of ultrashort battacin-inspired peptides, with some peptides shown to self-assemble into nanostructures and hydrogels while other sequences remain as small oligomeric species in solution. These peptides act by targeting the microbial membrane. Although there is a clear difference in self-assembling properties for these related sequences, it appeared difficult to draw a direct correlation with the antimicrobial activity measured on various strains (Glossop et al.  2019 ). The understanding of the direct interplay between self-assembly and antimicrobial activity requires more research to enunciate generic rules. Other targets than membranes affected by peptide self-assembly Rational design of peptide sequences to self-assemble into toxic aggregates within bacterial cells was reported for a few examples, although this approach remains marginal and mechanistic details still need to be unravelled. A smart design involving dephosphorylation induced self-assembly of a tripeptide derivative into toxic intracellular nanofibers was for instance reported (Yang et al.  2007 ). Such a peptide antibiotic was shown to be bacteriostatic. Another approach to induce intracellular peptide aggregation focused on bacterial genome screening to identify aggregation-prone sequences (Bednarska et al.  2016 ). Interestingly, antibacterial peptide sequences were obtained, including against resistant strains and with good indications of specific toxicity. Intracellular aggregation resulted in bacterial cell death. Extracellular peptide self-assembly, especially when resulting into hydrogels, can lead to bacteria entrapment and prevent cell mobility. This effect was reported for both natural antimicrobial sequences (Chairatana et al.  2016 ; Chairatana and Nolan  2017 ) and synthetic self-assembling peptides (Jiang et al.  2015 ). It is noteworthy that the matrix structure of bacterial biofilms relies on amyloid-like protein self-assembly into nanofibers. Hence, the current research effort on amyloid nanofibril self-assembly inhibition may lead to the discovery of compounds that chemically hinder biofilm formation (Andreasen et al.  2019 ). The self-assembly of endogenous antimicrobial peptides in complex with nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) has been shown to control Toll-like receptors activation and subsequent pro-inflammatory responses. Interestingly, it was recently supported that structural specificity of these complexes might be essential for triggering an immune response: the peptides self-assemble into nanoscaffolds that present ordered nucleic acids to immune receptors (Schmidt et al.  2015 ; Lee et al.  2017b ; Lee et al.  2019b ). Although this recently emerged area of research is directly relevant to auto-immune diseases, it may hold promise for unravelling novel mechanisms that promote antimicrobial activity and/or modulate immunogenicity to support novel peptide designs. Mechanisms of resistance to antimicrobial peptides Microbial pathogens have developed distinct systems to resist the effect of antimicrobial peptides. These systems involve the destruction of antimicrobial peptides, change of their target and removal of peptides from their site of action (Gunn  2001 ; Joo and Otto  2015 ). Some of the defence mechanisms of bacteria versus AMPs include sequestration or degradation by secreted proteases (Mattiuzzo et al.  2014 ), impedance by biofilm formation and exopolymers (Bechinger and Gorr  2017 ), surface modification (Gunn  2001 ), cytoplasmic membrane alteration and export by multidrug efflux pumps (Nizet  2006 ). Excellent reviews have provided details on these mechanisms and are presented in Table  5  and Fig.  4  (Guilhelmelli et al.  2013 ; Joo et al.  2016 ) (Table  5 , Fig.  4 ).

Figure modified from Joo et al.  2016 Extracellular proteolytic degradation Extracellular proteins are the first mechanism of defence and include proteases that degrade AMPs. Some of these proteases are SepA, aureolysin (metalloproteases), V8 protease and SepB that can protect against the human cathelicidin LL-37 (Schmidtchen et al.  2002 ; Barańska-Rybak et al.  2005 ; Frick et al.  2011 ). It has been observed that the interaction of SpeB and a host protein: alpha2M-binding (GRAB) creates a complex with a proteinase inhibitor bound on the surface that increases the resistance to LL-37 (Nyberg et al.  2004 ). Also, SpeB-degraded host proteoglycans release dermatan sulphate that neutralizes human alpha defensin HNP-1 (Schmidtchen et al.  2001 ) amongst others (Schmidtchen et al.  2002 ). Within Gram negative bacteria, the omptin family are aspartate proteases located in the enterobacterial outer membrane (OM) that cleave LL-37 and cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP) (Stumpe et al.  1998 ; Guina et al.  2000 ; Galván et al.  2008 ). Metalloproteases are also important for Gram negative bacteria since several AMPs such as LL-37, human beta defensin HBD-1 and the porcine AMP protegrin-1 are neutralized by the metalloprotease ZapA (Belas et al.  2004 ). This metalloprotease is produced by  P. mirabilis  and is not specific to AMPs as it also degrades components of the cell matrix (actin, collagen) and antibodies (Belas et al.  2004 ). The degradation of alpha and beta defensins has also been observed in  Porphyromonas gingivalis  (Carlisle et al.  2009 ). Similarly, various cationic AMPs (CAMPs) can be degraded by ZmpA and ZmpB produced by  B. cenocepacia  (Kooi and Sokol  2009 ). The degradation can also occur intracellularly with the help of transport proteins such as the ABC transporter that is encoded by the  sapABCDFZ  (Groisman et al.  1992 ; Mason et al.  2005 ). Moreover, an increased expression of genes in the sap operon is caused by the binding of the CAMPs by the SapA that leads to their proteolytic degradation (Mason et al.  2005 ; Mason et al.  2006 ; Shelton et al.  2011 ) as observed with  H. influenzae  with several AMPs such as LL-37, HBD-2, HBD-3 and HNP-1 and melittin (Mason et al.  2011 ). It is also important to note that inactivating AMPs highly depends on the structure of the target peptide. Linear structures are easier to degrade because the proteolytic areas are more exposed to cleavage than those with disulfide bonds. Bacteriocins such as lantibiotics contain sophisticated post-translational modification, presenting a resistance mechanism towards proteolytic degradation by the host or competing microorganisms (Bierbaum and Sahl  2009 ). Another resistance mechanism is the sequestration of AMPs. Staphylokinase is an important extracellular AMP-sequestering molecule that targets alpha defensins (HNP1 and 2) (Bokarewa and Tarkowski  2004 ). Another streptococcal sequester is streptococcal inhibitor of complement (SIC). It protects  S. pyogenes  from defensins, LL-37 and the membrane attack complex (Åkesson et al.  1996 ; Frick et al.  2003 ). Also, some streptococcal cell surface-attached proteins such as M1 and PilB from  S. pyogenes  and  S. agalactiae  respectively bind cathelicidins (LL-37 and CRAMP) providing resistance to AMPs (Maisey et al.  2008 ; Lauth et al.  2009 ). Exopolymers and biofilms A bacterial biofilm exhibits higher resistance to AMPs and antibiotics compared to planktonic bacteria (Nickel et al.  1985 ; Mah and O’Toole  2001 ). This is partially due to AMPs not being able to penetrate the biofilm matrix since EPS and capsular polysaccharides (CPS) can adsorb incoming antimicrobials, hinder their traversal into the biofilm, and limit their local concentration at the cells (Sugano et al.  2016 ; Singh et al.  2017 ). This property also applies especially to cationic AMPS (CAMPs), which have been found to bind to the anionic exopolysaccharide alginate from  P. aeruginosa  biofilms. This sequestering of CAMPs arises from the same mechanism by which they target anionic components of bacterial membranes. Negatively charged extracellular DNA (eDNA) is another major component of biofilms that may bind CAMPs (Mulcahy et al.  2008 ; Montanaro et al.  2011 ). eDNA is important for biofilm regulation and is secreted or released by lysed cells during biofilm growth, allowing for horizontal gene transfer within the bacterial population and also acting as a potential source of nutrients (Spoering and Gilmore  2006 ; Flemming and Wingender  2010 ; Mulcahy et al.  2010 ; Okshevsky and Meyer  2015 ) It has been proposed that this sharing of genetic material may enhance antimicrobial resistance, adaptability, and pathogenicity in the biofilm (Sykes  2010 ; Vorkapic et al.  2016 ) Furthermore, the chelation of cations such as magnesium (Mg 2+ ) by eDNA may trigger virulence responses in  P. aeruginosa  leading to AMP resistance (Mulcahy et al.  2008 ; Lewenza  2013 ; Wilton et al.  2016 ; Ibanez de Aldecoa et al.  2017 ). Polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) provides AMP resistance in different forms: it is efficient against LL-37, cationic HDB-3 and anionic dermicidin (Vuong et al.  2004b ; Wang et al.  2004b ), its deacetylation increases its positive net charge and repels CAMPs (Vuong et al.  2004a ), but is also crucial for biofilm formation and enhanced resistance (Heilmann et al.  1996 ; Rupp et al.  1999 ; Vuong et al.  2004b ). The CPS of  Klebsiella pneumoniae  or  P. aeruginosa  impedes CAMPs by electrostatic trapping (Campos et al.  2004 ; Llobet et al.  2008 ). Other capsules such as M protein and the hyaluronic acid capsule of group  A streptococci  also sequester AMPs (Cole et al.  2010 ). Bacteria ( P. aeruginosa  and  S. pyogenes ) can also exploit the host polysaccharide to sequester AMPs after degrading their host proteoglycan matrix with bacterial proteases (Schmidtchen et al.  2001 ). Exopolysaccharides play a major role in the resistance to LL-37 in  P. aeruginosa  and other lung pathogens (Herasimenka et al.  2005 ; Foschiatti et al.  2009 ). Also, in  Pseudomonas  species, alginate plays an important role in AMP resistance in biofilms (Hentzer et al.  2001 ). Alginate acts by mimicking the microbial membrane inducing changes in AMPs and prevents their diffusion since it binds and induces peptide aggregation (Chan et al.  2004 ; Chan et al.  2005 ). Poly-gamma-glutamic acid (PGA) exists only in Gram positive bacteria and coagulase-negative  staphylococci  and forms an extracellular capsule that protects from phagocytosis by leukocytes (Ogunleye et al.  2015 ). Although it protects from dermcidin, LL-37 and HBD-3 like PIA, it does not facilitate biofilm formation (Kocianova et al.  2005 ; Otto  2008 ). For these reasons, eradication of matured biofilms by AMPs is a complicated task, especially in vivo, where there may be limitations to the concentration of AMP allowed in treatments within a therapeutic window. Recent efforts to overcome the antibiotic resistance of biofilms involve the use of DNase to counter the effects of eDNA. DNase has been reported to disperse or destabilise bacterial biofilms of several medically relevant pathogens including  S. aureus ,  P. aeruginosa ,  E. coli  and  C. jejuni  (Tetz and Tetz  2010 ; Kaplan et al.  2012 ; Baelo et al.  2015 ; Brown et al.  2015 ) This gives credence to the further development of potential co-administration treatments of DNases and AMPs as a means of overcoming the resistance granted to bacteria by the biofilm matrix and its components (Jones et al.  2013 ; Fleming and Rumbaugh  2017 ). Surface modification The critical molecules on the cell surface involved in the resistance to AMPs are the anionic polymers attached to the outermost cell surface, teichoic acids (TA) in Gram positive cell wall and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in the Gram negative outer membrane. TA represent 60% of the cell wall in Gram positive bacteria and provide a negative cell charge (Kojima et al.  1985 ; Bera et al.  2007 ) but alanylation on free hydroxyls of the repeating sugars confers a positive charge to TA and this in turn decreases the attraction of CAMPs as observed with  S. aureus  (Peschel et al.  1999 ). D-alanylation also increases cell density suggesting a reduction of the permeability and electrostatic repulsion (Saar-Dover et al.  2012 ). Gram negative  Bordetella pertussis  uses D-alanylation via Dra (a Dlt homologue) to decrease the negative charge on the OM and increases resistance to LL-37, HNP-1, HNP-2 and polymyxin B (Taneja et al.  2013 ). Another mechanism involves the L-rhamnosylation of WTA in  L. monocytogenes  that increases the steric impediment in the cell wall (Carvalho et al.  2015 ). Modification of lipid II (which is an important cell wall building block and peptidoglycan precursor) is also performed by many bacteria to evade AMPs. The modification consists in the replacement of the terminal D-alanine with D-lactate or D-serine to prevent vancomycin binding to the D-Ala-D-Ala dipeptide and blocking the transpeptidation required for cell wall synthesis (Kahne et al.  2005 ). Lipid II with D-lactate or D-serine is found on resistant strains conferring them a 1000-fold increased resistance to vancomycin (Bugg et al.  1991 ). Bacteriocins and human AMPs HNP-1 and HBD-3 also use lipid II for pore formation (Brötz et al.  1998 ) and block cell wall biosynthesis respectively (de Leeuw et al.  2010 ). In Gram negative bacteria, LPS provides a negative charge (as TA in Gram positive bacteria) and its alteration is required for resistance to AMPs. Thus, amine containing molecules such as glycine, phosphoethanolamine (PEA) and 4-amino-4-deoxy-T-arabinose (Ara4N) increase the positive charge of LPS by modifying lipid A.  Acinetobacter baumannii  and  Bordetella  species perform the modification of lipid A with galactosamine or glucosamine (Llewellyn et al.  2012 ; Pelletier et al.  2013 ; Shah et al.  2014 ). The attachment of PEA onto phosphates in lipid A by  S. typhimurium ,  Neisseria gonorrhoea  and  A. baumanii  also decreases the anionic properties of LPS (Lee et al.  2004a ; Lewis et al.  2013 ; Pelletier et al.  2013 ).  Burkholderia  and  N. meningitidis  constitutively express PEA-attached lipid A conferring them a higher resistance to AMPs (Tzeng et al.  2005 ; Loutet and Valvano  2011 ). The removal of anionic phosphate groups from lipid A provides the same effect of adding positive molecules to LPS; this is done by phosphatases in  F. novicida  (Wang et al.  2004a ; Wang et al.  2006 ). In addition to the mentioned mechanisms, the O-antigen (outermost long polysaccharide chain in LPS) provides an extra barrier to Gram negative bacteria. A couple of studies have confirmed it is essential for AMP resistance in  Brucella abortus  and  B. cenocepacia  (Allen et al.  1998 ; Loutet et al.  2006 ). Alteration of the cytoplasmic membrane structure Since the cytoplasmic membrane is the major target of AMPs, bacteria modify it with different strategies. One of them is the amino acylation of the phosphatidyl glycerol (PG) head group, which masks anionic phosphates with cationic primary amines. This prevents CAMPs attraction to anionic head groups and results in electrostatic repulsion (Peschel et al.  2001 ). The protein responsible for this amino acylation is the multipeptide resistance factor (MprF) and was first described in  S. aureus  (Peschel et al.  2001 ). The C-terminal synthase domain of MprF uses PG and aminoacyl-tRNA as substrates, the resulting aminoacyl-PG is sent to the outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane by MprF (Ernst et al.  2009 ). A different combination of substrates has been used by other bacteria such as Ala-PG in  P. aeruginosa  (Klein et al.  2009 ), Lys-PG and Lys-CL in  Listeria monocytogenes  (Thedieck et al.  2006 ) and Lys-PG and Ala-PG in  Clostridium perfringes  (Johnston et al.  2004 ). Lys-PG has also been reported in Gram negative bacteria such as  Caulobacter crescentus  (Jones and Smith  1979 ) or  Rhizobium tropici  (Sohlenkamp et al.  2007 ). Finally, the increase of saturated acyl chains can provide a higher membrane rigidity and higher resistance to nisin and pediocin in  L. monocytogenes  and  E. faecalis  respectively (Mazzotta and Montville  1997 ; Kumariya et al.  2015 ). Similarly, the addition of carotenoid phyloxanthin has been reported to stabilize the acyl chains in the membrane and increase its rigidity in  S. aureus  (Mishra et al.  2011 ). Efflux pumps Efflux pumps can remove the AMPs even when they have attached to the cytoplasmic membrane. They are energy-dependent transporters that expel not only AMPs but also other antibiotics (Poole  2007 ). Gram negative bacteria contain a resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) family of transporters (Piddock  2006 ; Delmar et al.  2014 ). A typical AMP efflux pump of this family has three components: (1) inner membrane proton/ AMP antiporter, (2) an outer membrane (OM) transporter and (3) a periplasmic accessory protein that provides stability to the whole complex. Some of examples of efflux pumps in Gram negative bacteria include AcrAB-TolC in  K. pneumoniae,  which is efficient against polymyxin B and HNP-1, HBD-1 (human defensins), and VexAB-TolC of  V. cholerae  that also protects from polymyxin B (Bina et al.  2008 ). RosA, RosB in  Y. enterocolotica  and  K. pneumoniae  is a major facilitator superfamily (MFS) efflux pump that also confers resistance to polymyxin B (Bengoechea and Skurnik  2000 ; Padilla et al.  2010 ). Within Gram positive bacteria, AMP-exporting efflux pumps are ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters that can secrete or produce immunity against newly synthesized AMPs (Gebhard  2012 ). NisT of  Lactococcus lactis  exports nisin (Qiao and Saris  1996 ) and Epi FEG of  S. epidermidis  exports epidermin and gallidermin (Otto et al.  1998 ). The BceAb type are another group of two-component ABC transporters that are active on lantibiotics, cyclic AMPs and defensins, glycopeptides and cathelicidin and have a wider range of action vs. AMPs (Gebhard  2012 ). The transporter VraFG in  S. aureus  provides resistance to several AMPs (nisin, bacitracin, vancomycin, indolicidin, LL-37 and HBD-3 (Li et al.  2007a ; Falord et al.  2012 ; Gebhard  2012 ). The BceAb-type transporters have also been detected in  B. subtilis ,  S. pneumoniae  and other Gram positive bacteria (Becker et al.  2000 ; Ohki et al.  2003 ; Collins et al.  2010 ; Gebhard  2012 ). The MefE/Mel is a unique efflux pump in  S. pneumoniae  of the MFS and ABC families that confers resistance to LL-37 (Ambrose et al.  2005 ; Zähner et al.  2010 ). Sensing systems The AMP resistance mechanisms are regulated by sensors and regulators in order to save energy. The antimicrobial peptide sensor (Aps) was first observed in  S. epidermidis  and is also known as GraRs or GraRSX (Li et al.  2007b ). It has three components: a membrane-bound AMP sensing histidine kinase (ApsS), DNA-binding response regulator (ApsR) and another component (ApsS). The expression of genes involved in AMP resistance mechanisms is regulated by the Aps and one of them is the  dlt  operon for TA alanylation, the  mprF  gene for PG lysinylation and the  vraFG  ABC transporter. Systems homologous to Aps are also found in Gram positive pathogens such as  Bacillus anthracis ,  Clostridium difficile ,  L. monocytogenes ,  S. pneumoniae  and  Sthaphylococcus haemolyticus  (Li et al.  2007b ). Other systems that sense and regulate resistance mechanisms are BceSR of  B. subtilis , BraSRVraSR in  S. aureus  and LiaFSR in  Streptococci  (Suntharalingam et al.  2009 ). Within Gram negative bacteria, the PhoPQ acts as a central regulator (Groisman et al.  1989 ; Miller et al.  1989 ). PhoPQ is located in the cytoplasmic membrane and is a histidine kinase sensor while PhoP is the corresponding DNA-binding response regulator. PhoPQ and PmrAB (another two-component system) regulate lipid A modifications involved with AMP resistance (Gunn et al.  1998 ; Herrera et al.  2010 ). Some PhoPQ homologous are found in several strains such as  S. typhimurium ,  Y. pestis  and  Shigella flexneri  (Moss et al.  2000 ; Oyston et al.  2000 ; Rebeil et al.  2004 ; Bader et al.  2005 ). Molecular engineering approaches for antimicrobial peptide motif design AMPs isolated from natural sources typically exhibit common sequence motifs: the peptides are 12–50 amino acid long, are highly cationic (net charge between + 2 and + 9) and amphipathic, with around 50% of hydrophobic residues in their sequence (Hancock and Sahl  2006 ). Starting from these general design rules, recent strategies for AMP molecular engineering include the use of high-throughput screening, machine learning, modelling tools and combinatorial libraries to aid in the identification and initial characterization of lead sequences (Kang et al.  2014 ; Zhang and Gallo  2016 ; Bechinger and Gorr  2017 ). Bioinformatic tools Considering the structural diversity of AMPs, bioinformatics has significant advantages in the computational enumeration of all possible peptide sequences (Travkova et al.  2017 ; Nagarajan et al.  2018 ). Online databases that contain large AMP libraries and several bioinformatic functions based on classification algorithms and machine learning have been built in the past decade to assist on the rational design of antimicrobial peptides, allowing the identification and optimization of new lead sequences in a time and cost-effective manner. A classic application of those tools is the use of artificial neural network (ANN), quantitative matrices (QM) and support vector machine (SVM) to predict antibacterial peptides (Wang and Wang  2004 ; Kang et al.  2014 ; Wang et al.  2016a ; Zhang and Gallo  2016 ). Computer-assisted AMP design is useful for estimating the desired biological activity from the primary peptide structure. There are five types of prediction methods for AMPs; (1) prediction based on mature peptide sequences only (2) prediction based on precursor sequences only, (3) prediction based on both mature and precursor sequences, (4) prediction based on sequence similarity of the modifying enzymes and (5) prediction based on genomic information. The databases can also indicate related information such as specific target, antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity (Hammam and Fliss  2010 ). Commonly used online databases are compiled in Table  6 . Online peptide modelling tools are also available to assess physicochemical parameters, such as aggregation in aqueous media and pharmacokinetic profiles. Examples of modelling tools include (i)TANGO to predict amyloid cross-beta aggregation (Rousseau et al.  2006 ; Goldschmidt et al.  2010 ); (ii) ZipperDB to evaluate the peptide fibrillogenic propensity profile (Rousseau et al.  2006 ; Goldschmidt et al.  2010 ); (iii) GROMACS to perform molecular dynamics simulations (Pronk et al.  2013 ); and (iv) SWISSADME to predict pharmacokinetic properties, drug-like nature and medicinal chemistry friendliness (Daina et al.  2017 ).

Antiviral peptides database (AVPdb) http://crdd.osdd.net/servers/avpdb/index.php Antiviral peptides (Qureshi et al.  2014 ). Machine learning has recently been applied as a high-throughput molecular design approach for AMPs, fed by the increased depth of molecular understanding of AMP activity, especially membrane activity, and by the immense molecular dataset compiled by researchers over the past decades (Lee et al.  2017a ; Lee et al.  2018a ; Lee et al.  2018b ). Although in its early ages, such high-throughput methods hold promises for a boost to the development of lead candidates for clinical translation of rationally designed minimal antimicrobial peptides. Top-down molecular design In top-down molecular design, an AMP sequence, generally from a natural source, is used as a starting template for systematic sequence truncation, amino acid substitution, hybridization and cyclization in order to obtain important information on the structural activity correlation and further design shorter AMPs with improved antimicrobial activity and selectivity (Ong et al.  2014 ; da Costa et al.  2015 ). Evolutionary conserved AMPs typically have long sequences of amino acids with redundancy in the sequence required for potent antimicrobial activities, thus trimming the natural AMP sequence allows a shorter active motif to be acquired, which can have reduced cost involved in the industrial scale production of the synthetic AMP for therapeutic use. Furthermore, the removal of naturally occurring peptide regions with undesired properties could also yield synthetic derivatives with reduced toxicity or immunogenicity (Ong et al.  2014 ; da Costa et al.  2015 ). Applying the principle of template modification, it is also possible to construct hybrid peptides composed by truncated fragments from multiple types of naturally occurring AMPs, so-called multidomain peptides. The resulting sequences could offer an effective strategy to capitalize on the desirable properties of the individual parent peptides. Such an approach typically involves the amalgamation of a sequence from a potent, but comparatively toxic AMP with a less active AMP having lower toxicity (Bianco et al.  2013 ; Ong et al.  2014 ; Zhu et al.  2017 ). Alanine scanning is another typical top-down approach to studying the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of an AMP to in turn optimize the peptide. Exemplary AMP alanine scanning studies include that of polymyxin B, which elucidated the SAR but also gave credence to optimized structures. More recently, alanine scanning on tridecaptin A1 (Kanazawa et al.  2009 ; Cochrane et al.  2014 ; Ballantine et al.  2019 ) revealed favourable modifications to retain activity but at a reduced synthetic cost, whereas alanine scanning of the linear battacin octapeptide revealed a truncated pentapeptide sequence that retained most of its antimicrobial activity (De Zoysa et al.  2015 ). Additional top-down designs include NSAID drug-peptide conjugates exhibiting antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and self-assembling hydrogelator properties all in one due to the modification of a self-assembling peptide (McCloskey et al.  2016 ). Further techniques include the reorientation of a peptide structure without changing the amino acid composition, such as in the case of retro, inverso and retro-inverso peptide modifications (Chorev and Goodman  1995 ; Li et al.  2010 ; Parthsarathy et al.  2013 ). Bottom-up molecular design Bottom-up molecular design relies on the fundamental understanding of the impact of key chemical peptide features for antimicrobial activity (Frecer et al.  2004 ; Zelezetsky and Tossi  2006 ). A simplified approach is typically applied such as combining (i) cationic amino acids for electrostatic interactions with the microbial membranes and (ii) non-polar amino acids for insertion or permeation of the microbial membrane (Sforça et al.  2004 ; Matsuzaki  2009 ; Oddo and Hansen  2017 ). This approach is highly attractive for drug development as it can lead to the identification of the smallest motif or pharmacophore essential for antimicrobial effects, which could in turn increase the ease of optimization through systematic modifications to the short peptide sequence (Gordon et al.  2005 ; Ong et al.  2014 ) (Fig.  5 ). Fig. 5 Three-stage de novo peptide design workflow diagram. (1) design inputs and sequence selection; (2) fold specificity; (3) approximate binding affinity. Modified from Smadbeck et al.  2014 Combined with bioinformatics, a complete de novo peptide design framework usually consists in three stages: an optimization-based sequence selection, fold specificity calculation and approximate binding affinity calculation (Fig.  5 ) (Klepeis et al.  2004 ; Smadbeck et al.  2014 ). The first stage of the method is a sequence selection stage which uses a set of design inputs such as biologically relevant constraints in an integer linear optimization model to produce a rank ordered list of sequences with the lowest potential energy in a given template structure. The comparative model in peptides is based on the fact that sequence similarity implies structural similarity, thus the structure of an active peptide can be predicted by comparing the amino acid sequence to that of known native 3D structures. However, similar structures can be found for peptides with different sequences. The second stage collects the top sequences from the sequence selection stage and determines the specificity of candidates for the target. It determines how well-designed sequences fold into the desired template structure compared to the native sequence. The sequences with the top fold specificity values are then run through a computationally rigorous third stage to calculate the approximate binding affinity of the sequences to the target. Those peptides with the highest predicted binding affinity are then validated experimentally (Klepeis et al.  2004 ; Smadbeck et al.  2014 ). Multivalent ligand design is another technique for AMP motif design, wherein multiple copies of an AMP are appended to a branched core. Branched multivalent peptide systems have also been investigated extensively in antimicrobial peptide design. Early study on multiple antigen peptide (MAP) systems was eventually translated into the field of antimicrobial peptide chemistry due to the inherent proteolytic stability of MAP ligands (Tam  1988 ; Bracci et al.  2003 ). This technique typically involves appending identical AMPs to a branched multi-lysine core to yield a multivalent peptide array and was utilised by Pini et al. to form a tetrabranched M33 antimicrobial peptide system with high proteolytic stability (Pini et al.  2010 ). Antimicrobial peptide motifs and their rationale A number of peptide motifs have been identified to promote antimicrobial activity and pharmacokinetic properties that aid molecular engineering translatable AMPs, as developed below. Necessary peptide features for antimicrobial activity Several studies have established that strong antimicrobial potencies can be obtained with engineered synthetic AMPs consisting of a cationic amino acid combined with a non-polar amino acid. Thus, AMPs generally contain positively charged amino acid residues (Dab, Orn, Lys and Arg) and hydrophobic residues (Phe, Trp, Tyr, Met) in a ratio varying from 1:1 to 1:2. Their primary structure is often characterized by a net positive charge of + 2 to + 9. Hydrophobic and non-charged peptides such as the aromatic peptide diphenylalanine have also shown antimicrobial activity due mainly to hydrophobic interactions (Strom et al.  2002 ; Klepeis et al.  2004 ; Ong et al.  2014 ). It has been reported that increasing the positive charge of the peptide results in increasing antibacterial activity. However, there is a limit since a very high net charge can lead to an enhanced haemolytic propensity and a loss of antimicrobial activity. Additionally, the most common motif found in AMPs is the secondary structures; however, many of them also exist as unstructured conformers (Galdiero et al.  2013 ; Falanga et al.  2017 ). Studies have suggested that a free N-terminal amino group and an amidated C-terminal on a peptide are correlated to a high antimicrobial activity. Thus, the balance between cationic residues, aromatic residues, an amidated C-terminal end and a free N-terminal amino group constitutes a highly efficient motif in antimicrobial peptides (Strom et al.  2002 ; Chen et al.  2010 ; Deslouches et al.  2013 ; Ong et al.  2014 ). Choice of specific amino acids Arginine and lysine are the most common cationic residues in AMP sequences as they are protonated under physiological conditions and have been found to be related strong antimicrobial activities. While the incorporation of arginine residues in AMPs confers greater antimicrobial activity, their presence is frequently associated with relatively higher haemolytic activities as compared to the use of lysine residues. Due to their common occurrence in many naturally occurring AMPs such as cathelicidins, the combination of cationic arginine with hydrophobic tryptophan residues represents one of the most extensively investigated designs for synthetic AMPs. This combination is believed to be extremely efficient as the guanidinium side chain of arginine undergoes hydrogen bonding with negatively charged microbial membranes while participating in cationic–π interactions with the aromatic indole side chain of tryptophan, making AMP penetration into the hydrophobic lipid bilayer more energetically favoured. The bulky amphipathic character of the indole side chain in Trp is also believed to aid in the interfacial association of AMP with lipid bilayers and to mediate cohesive hydrophobic interactions with the lipid acyl chains during membrane penetration (Strom et al.  2002 ; Klepeis et al.  2004 ; Ong et al.  2014 ). Secondary and supramolecular structures In addition to the amphipathic content of the peptide primary sequence, their folding into distinct secondary structures either in the presence of bacterial membranes (e.g. cathelicidins and magainins) or constitutively (e.g. the defensins) is also a well-studied motif for antimicrobial activity. Generally, a basic repeating sequence pattern of amino acids that can be arranged into stabilized α-helical, β-sheet and/or hairpin structures are selected (Chen et al.  2010 ; Deslouches et al.  2013 ; Ong et al.  2014 ). Due to charge repulsion between cationic entities, linear AMPs often remain as free unstructured molecules in aqueous solutions, which facilitate their diffusion across the bacterial capsule and/or cell wall to the membrane lipid bilayers. Various peptide motifs were reported to enhance the stability of specific secondary structures, including for AMPs. For instance, the high proline content of insect AMPs has been correlated to a high helical propensity favouring membrane insertion (Chen et al.  2010 ; Ong et al.  2014 ). Although self-assembly may inherently arise from amphipathic primary and/or secondary structures, simple aromatic motifs recently emerged as chemical tricks to induce the intrinsic formation of peptide supramolecular structures in solution via mainly pi-stacking interactions. Notable examples include (i) fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) driving self-assembly when conjugated to peptides, generally resulting in the formation of hydrogels, and (ii) the amyloid-derived diphenylalanine motif inducing self-assembly into nanofibers or nanotubes when present in a sequence. These motifs were incorporated into numerous de novo designed peptides, including self-assembling AMPs (Schnaider et al.  2017 ; Glossop et al.  2019 ). Non-proteinogenic amino acids and peptide termini Unnatural residues, such as D-amino acids, improve proteolytic stability because proteases have poor affinity for unnatural side chains (Weinstock et al.  2012 ). Another common modification is N-alkylation of amino acids, typically N-methylation, which can improve pharmacokinetic properties. Studies on the cyclic peptide somatostatin yielded analogues with up to 10% improved oral bioavailability when N-methylated at certain points (Biron et al.  2008 ). While N-terminal acylation reduces the overall charge of the peptide, it improves proteolytic stability depending on the sequence and may also drastically improve antimicrobial activity of AMPs or grant activity to inactive sequences (Malina and Shai  2005 ; Radzishevsky et al.  2005 ; Glossop et al.  2018 ). Amidation is a common C-terminal modification employed to improve the antimicrobial potency of peptides in two ways, by increasing the net charge of the peptide and by enhancing proteolytic stability, thus improving half-life times in vivo (Stromstedt et al.  2009 ; Kumar et al.  2014 ; Mura et al.  2016 ). N-terminal acetylation and amidation may also enhance helicity by stabilising hydrogen bonding (Fairman et al.  1989 ; Stromstedt et al.  2009 ). Fluorination Fluorination is a frequent modification in medicinal chemistry and as such has been translated to peptide and protein engineering (Yoder and Kumar  2002 ). A small subset of AMPs feature naturally halogenated residues such as bromotryptophan in hagfish cathelicidins and hedistin (Uzzell et al.  2003 ; Tasiemski et al.  2007 ). Fluorination has been employed to enhance AMP activity through stabilised conformation and increased proteolytic resistance. Most notably, analogues of melittin substituting every leucine residue for 5,5,5-trifluoroleucine exhibited enhanced binding to DOPC vesicle membranes due to improved self-association in solution from hydrophobic interactions from trifluoroleucine (Niemz and Tirrell  2001 ). Furthermore, fluorinated buforin and magainin analogues were found to exhibit modest resistance to trypsin proteolytic degradation while retaining or improving in antimicrobial efficacy (Meng and Kumar  2007 ). However, this came at the cost of greater hemolysis in some fluorinated analogues. Studies on longer helical sequences by Lee et al. have also reported on the benefits of fluorination, in this case by hexafluoroleucine, in enhancing helical protein stability (Lee et al.  2004b ). Further study of substitutions with hexafluoroleucine generated the magainin analogue fluorogainin-1, which resisted proteolytic degradation under the same conditions that degraded the unfluorinated parent peptide, while exhibiting improved antimicrobial activity towards  K. pneumoniae and S. aureus  (Gottler et al.  2008 ). Overall, fluorination has generally positive outcomes when designing synthetic AMPs. Antimicrobial peptide lipidation Lipopeptide motifs and antimicrobial activity There are several examples of inactive peptides that gained antimicrobial activity upon conjugation of a hydrophobic acyl group (Malina and Shai  2005 ). Structure-activity studies were conducted by generating lipopeptides of varying fatty acid lengths (Nasompag et al.  2015 ; Glossop et al.  2018 ). Over improving lipid membrane insertion, fatty acid conjugation may enhance secondary structure characteristics: magainin-2 analogues showed tuneable helical, β-sheet, and oligomeric conformations depending on the size of attached fatty acid, from heptanoyl to palmitoyl in length (Avrahami and Shai  2002 ). Typically, longer fatty acids improve lipopeptide antimicrobial activity, but at a certain threshold also contribute to cytotoxicity. The acyl group may vary widely in structure from saturated fatty acyl moieties to unsaturated, branched or aromatic groups (Chooi and Tang  2010 ). Prime examples of lipopeptide antibiotics that have undergone extensive structure-activity studies are the polymyxins and daptomycin. These lipopeptides are cyclic in structure and contain a majority of cationic and anionic charged side chains, respectively, and a fatty acyl chain in addition to hydrophobic residues. Both of these drugs have potent antimicrobial activity, even against multidrug-resistant strains (Dixon and Chopra  1986 ; Steenbergen et al.  2005 ; Zavascki et al.  2007 ). Structure-activity studies on polymyxins revealed that acyl chain length is also important for the spectrum of activity against pathogens. Polymyxin B analogues were found to have ideal acyl chains of 7–9 carbon length (Naoki et al.  2004 ). Studies on magainin analogues indicate that the fatty acyl moiety can modulate solution conformation and cell selectivity as well (Avrahami and Shai  2002 ). The primary sequence of the peptide component has the greatest influence over peptide hydrophobicity, stability, net charge and secondary structure. Lipopeptides may be cyclic or linear and may or may not have an exocyclic peptide region to which the fatty acyl chain is conjugated. An example of important primary peptide sequence is the hydrophobic dipeptide motif observed in polymyxin B (D-Phe-6, L-Leu-7) and E (D-Leu-6, L-Leu-7). The hydrophobic region provided by this dipeptide in the macrocycle is considered to contribute significantly to the amphipathicity of the lipopeptide as well as its biological interaction with Gram negative bacterial outer membranes (Pristovsek and Kidric  1999 ). The same phenylalanine and leucine combinations are seen in octapeptins (Velkov et al.  2017 ). Charged amino acids are important determinants of lipopeptide surfactant and antimicrobial activity as they contribute to the hydrophilicity and electrostatic interactions of the peptide at physiological pH. Residues such as lysine and its relatives Dab or ornithine (2,5-diaminovaleric acid) are common cationic moieties found in natural antimicrobial lipopeptides such as the polymyxins, octapeptins and tridecaptins, which target anionic bacterial membranes, whereas daptomycin and its congeners feature anionic residues involved in their calcium-directed mechanisms (Kato et al.  1979 ; Baltz et al.  2005 ; Kanazawa et al.  2009 ; Velkov et al.  2017 ). Rarely will membrane-lytic lipopeptide antibiotics have neutral net charge at physiological pH such as in the case of iturin A, a potent antifungal agent and surfactant (Besson et al.  1984 ). The incorporation of negatively charged residues into the peptide sequence is important for acidic lipopeptides such as daptomycin, amphomycins, tsushimycin, laspartomycins and friulimicins (Tanaka et al.  1977 ; Bunkoczi et al.  2005 ; Steenbergen et al.  2005 ; Borders et al.  2007 ; Schneider et al.  2009 ). These anionic lipopeptides often undergo conformational changes by interacting with calcium ions, effecting a stronger amphipathic structure and enhanced activity, whereas cationic lipopeptides, such as the polymyxins, have weaker antibiotic activity in vitro at higher concentrations of divalent cations such as Mg 2+  (Daugelavicius et al.  2000 ; Ho et al.  2008 ). Lipopeptide motifs for self-assembly into different colloidal morphologies Self-assembly into various types of colloids can be programmed by conjugating a peptide sequence to an acyl chain. The resulting morphologies range from nanofibers and nanoribbons to micelles and vesicles (Cui et al.  2010 ; Webber et al.  2011 ; Hendricks et al.  2017 ). The influence of both the peptide sequence and acyl chain on the resulting colloidal morphology has been thoroughly investigated by Stupp’s group (Hendricks et al.  2017 ). For instance, a minimum of 10 carbon long acyl chain was found necessary to induce the hydrophobic effect needed to direct one-dimensional self-assembly into elongated morphologies. However, variation in the peptide residues closer to the acyl chain can still induce spherical micelles through altering hydrogen bonding capacity, while assembly into flat structures is favoured by alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues in the peptide sequence (Hendricks et al.  2017 ). The conjugation of various bioactive peptide sequences to acyl chains has been reported to achieve the combination of nanostructure formation and biological/therapeutic activity in a single molecule (Silva et al.  2004 ; Webber et al.  2011 ; Hendricks et al.  2017 ). Table  7  compiles the main peptide motifs reported to enhance antimicrobial activity and other properties important in the molecular engineering of such peptide drug molecules.

A recent SWOT analysis identified critical weaknesses associated with the development of peptides as therapeutics: (1) chemically and physically instable, (2) prone to hydrolysis and oxidation, (3) tendency for aggregation, (4) short half-life and fast elimination, (5) not orally available and (6) low membrane permeability (Fosgerau and Hoffmann  2015 ). Besides the discovery and design of thousands of AMPs to date, very few AMP drugs have advanced to clinical development to date (Magana et al.  2020 ). In addition to molecular engineering principles developed in the previous sections, a number of formulation approaches are currently being investigated to overcome the challenge to reach clinical stage. An overview of peptide formulations is here provided with a focus on the latest advances in peptide and lipid nanotechnology, which are identified as the most promising formulations for translation (Magana et al.  2020 ). Biomedical applications of antimicrobial peptide self-assembled nanostructures Peptide hydrogels result from the self-assembly of amphipathic and/or aromatic rich sequences into elongated nanostructures, including nanofibers and nanotubes, which reticulate the aqueous media into a gel. In recent years, peptide hydrogels have gained attention for broad biomedical applications, from therapeutic formulations to tissue engineering (Mondal et al.  2020 ). The intrinsic self-assembly of antimicrobial peptide sequences into elongated nanostructures was reported for various sequences, opening the door to hydrogel applications for self-assembling AMPs (Shi et al.  2021 ). A remarkable example is the molecular engineering of short AMP sequences into self-assembling peptides that form hydrogels. For instance, the antibacterial sequence (KIGAKI) 3 -NH 2  was incorporated into an engineered beta-hairpin sequence, resulting in hydrogels active against  E. coli  (Liu et al.  2013 ). Peptide sequences designed to self-assemble into nanostructured hydrogels also showed intrinsic antimicrobial properties. For instance, the synthetic sequence of MAX1 peptide was designed as an amphiphilic beta-hairpin of alternating lysine and valine residues, in order to induce self-assembly. This strategy resulted in the formation of rigid nanostructured hydrogels (Schneider et al.  2002 ). This elegantly designed hydrogel was shown to be active against both Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria when directly in contact with colonies, with a proposed mechanism of action involving disruption of the bacterial lipid membrane (Salick et al.  2007 ). Within the broad landscape of applications being currently explored for AMP hydrogels, one of the most promising ones appears to be their use as topical treatments, to cure skin infections or promote wound healing (Pfalzgraff et al.  2018 ). In the current context of a viral pandemic, self-assembling AMPs could be of use as vaccine adjuvants or nanocarriers. Subunit vaccines, which are composed of synthetic antigen peptides or proteins, require adjuvants to stimulate an appropriate immune response. Amongst the several immunological adjuvants that have been developed so far (such as nanoparticles, liposomes, and polymers), an interesting category could be self-assembling AMP nanostructures (Hudalla et al.  2014 ; Wang et al.  2016b ). Self-assembling AMPs could be used as delivery carriers for antigenic proteins and/or to boost immunogenicity, especially considering the immunomodulatory properties of some AMP sequences. The deposition of arrays of solid-state peptide nanostructures was shown to provide antibacterial properties to the surface. The vertically aligned arrays of diphenylalanine nanotubes showed activity against  E. coli , through their topological capacity to disrupt bacterial membranes (Schnaider et al.  2017 ). This original bionanomaterial deposition augurs well for a future use of self-assembling AMPs as medical coatings. Formulations of antimicrobial peptides with lipid nanomaterials The encapsulation of antimicrobial peptides in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) confers two main advantages: Firstly, LNPs provide encapsulated peptides protection from enzymatic and chemical degradation. Such protection is otherwise difficult to achieve via modifications to the peptides chemical structure, due to the inherently fragile constituent peptide bonds. Secondly, increases in efficacy and bioavailability are possible via further functionalization of lipid nanoparticles, enabling the formulation of targeted delivery vehicles through techniques such as surface conjugation of antibodies, or the design of environment-responsive or triggered release particles. A wide range of lipid-based nanoparticle species have been investigated as delivery vehicles for antimicrobial peptides, ranging from liposomes to liquid crystalline cubic nanoparticles (Table  8 ). Table 8 Summary of various studies in which antimicrobial peptides are encapsulated within LNPs Peptide LNP type Reference Gramicidin A, alamethicin, melittin, indolicidin, pexiganan, cecropin A Liquid crystal nanoparticles (Meikle et al.  2016 ; Meikle et al.  2017 ; Meikle et al.  2021 ) LL-37, AP114, DP-060 Liquid crystal nanoparticles (Boge et al.  2016 ; Gontsarik et al.  2016 ; Boge et al.  2017 ; Boge et al.  2019a ; Boge et al.  2019b ; Zabara et al.  2019 ) Cyclosporin A Liquid crystal nanoparticles (Lai et al.  2010 ) KSL-W Liquid crystal nanoparticles (Bernegossi et al.  2016 ) Nisin Liposome (Benech et al.  2002 ; Benech et al.  2003 ; Laridi et al.  2003 ) Vancomycin Liposome (Nicolosi et al.  2010 ) Polymyxin B Liposome (Alipour et al.  2009 ) Gramicidin Liposome (Ragioto et al.  2014 ) Melittin Liposome (Zetterberg et al.  2011 ) DP7-C Liposome (Liu et al.  2016 ) Whey peptides Liposome (Mohan et al.  2018 ) Indolicidin Liposome (Ahmad et al.  1995 ; Ron-Doitch et al.  2016 ) LL-37 Liposome (Ron-Doitch et al.  2016 ) Alyteserin-1c Liposome (Cantor et al.  2019 ) Microcin J25 Liposome (Gomaa et al.  2017 ) P34 Liposome (da Silva Malheiros et al.  2011 ) Pediocin AcH Liposome (Degnan and Luchansky  1992 ; Degnan et al.  1993 ) Temporin Liposome (Mizukami et al.  2010 ) CM3 Liposome (Lange et al.  2001 ) Polymyxin B Lipid micelles (Brandenburg et al.  2012 ) Cyclosporin A Solid lipid nanoparticles (Zhang et al.  2000 ; Müller et al.  2006 ; Kim et al.  2009 ) Nisin Solid lipid nanoparticles (Prombutara et al.  2012 ) Polymyxin B Solid lipid nanoparticles (Severino et al.  2017 ) LL-37/serapinA1 Solid lipid nanoparticles (Fumakia and Ho  2016 ) Given the lipid bilayer structure inherent in these materials, it is unsurprising that membrane disruptive peptides have the potential to influence phase behaviour and structural parameters. Thus, careful characterization is necessary to determine any changes in material properties that come as a result of peptide loading and resulting peptide-membrane interactions. For example, the encapsulation of gramicidin A in cubic phase lipid materials has repeatedly revealed a shift towards structures with high negative curvature, such as hexosomes, with increasing peptide concentration (Liu and Caffrey  2005 ; Meikle et al.  2016 ; Meikle et al.  2017 ). The cationic charge of many AMPs must also be considered; electrostatic repulsion between membrane associated peptides appears to influence lipid phase behaviour as well as encapsulation efficiency (Boge et al.  2017 ; Meikle et al.  2017 ; Meikle et al.  2021 ). Manipulation of these interactions via the addition of anionic lipids to the cubosome formulation, or the inclusion of a charge screening buffer condition, can lead to favourable structural properties and increased peptide loading (Boge et al.  2017 ). Antimicrobial activity of cubosome encapsulated AMPs is seen to increase in some cases, decreasing in others. Work is currently underway exploring the fusion and uptake mechanisms involved in cubosome-bacteria interactions (Dyett et al.  2019 ; Meikle et al.  2020 ; Meikle et al.  2021 ). Liposomes have long been utilized as nanocarriers for various drugs, as their structure allows for both hydrophobic and amphiphilic drug encapsulation within the membrane, while hydrophilic drugs can be contained within the liposome interior. They are also highly biocompatible and non-toxic; the first FDA approved nanodrug was Doxil, a liposomal doxorubicin formulation (Barenholz  2012 ). Design considerations include maximising both stability and peptide loading efficiency, achieved via careful selection of lipid formulations. Accordingly, lipids for which AMPs display selectivity or increased activity, such as those containing anionic head groups, are often avoided due to complete disruption of the liposomal bilayer. A wide range of antimicrobial peptides have since been formulated with liposomes. In a recent study, DSPC/DSPE-PEG liposomes were used to encapsulate the AMP LL-37 (Ron-Doitch et al.  2016 ). Characterisation and activity experiments showed that the liposomal formulation possessed increased antiviral activity against HSV-1, with reduced toxicity over the free peptide. Cantor et al. have also demonstrated increased antimicrobial activity following encapsulation of the peptide alyteserin-1c in polymer-coated liposomes (Cantor et al.  2019 ). Other lipid-based nanoparticle formulations are under investigation for AMP delivery, including phospholipid micelles, recently investigated for the encapsulation of polymyxin B (Brandenburg et al.  2012 ). In this study, encapsulation of the peptide in DSPE-PEG(2000) micelles was high; however, the in vitro activity against  P. aeruginosa  was significantly reduced compared to free peptide, presumably due to reduced electrostatic interactions between the encapsulated peptide and the bacterial membrane as a result of the PEG (200) coating. Solid lipid nanoparticle solutions are colloidal dispersions of solid-state lipids, often stabilized with surfactants. They are formulated using lipids with increased melting points, such as mono- and tri-glycerides, steroids and fatty acids. Various production methods have been proposed, and parameters such as drug structure and solubility, final particle size and production conditions such as increased temperature must be considered. They have been used for the encapsulation of polymyxin B (Brandenburg et al.  2012 ), cyclosporin A (Zhang et al.  2000 ; Müller et al.  2006 ; Kim et al.  2009 ) and nisin (Prombutara et al.  2012 ). To increase wound healing, Fumika et al. fabricated solid lipid nanoparticles comprised of glyceryl monostearate and phosphatidylcholine co-encapsulated with two AMPs, LL-37 and serpin A1 (Fumakia and Ho  2016 ). The nanoparticles were found to accelerate wound healing and closure via BJ fibroblasts and keratinocytes, and the two peptides were found to possess synergistic antimicrobial activity against  S. aureus  and  E. coli . Conclusion Worldwide health institutions generally project multidrug-resistant infections to cause several million deaths annually by 2050. In the search for new antimicrobial compounds and biomaterials to counter the alarming progression of such infections, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered as promising candidates by the research community. The increasing interest in these compounds is indicated by the exponential number of scientific articles published on AMPs, which led this review to cite close to 400 references to provide a global overview of this accelerating research area. AMPs present the advantage of typically targeting microbial lipid membranes, a site of action less prone to resistance. AMPs often concomitantly act on other microbial sites, either intracellular and/or extracellular targets. Such multi-target mechanisms of action further limit the occurrence of resistance. The recent years have seen the emergence of molecular engineering principles for the creation of optimised synthetic AMPs. Thanks to intense fundamental research in peptide design, it is now possible to engineer and optimise short peptide sequences that exhibit selective antimicrobial activity while limiting toxicity. Peptide molecular engineering is also now capable to optimise sequences towards biomaterial applications via controlling peptide self-assembling properties, including into nanostructured peptide hydrogels. Challenges still remain to translate this global research effort to marketed products, especially improving pharmacokinetic properties of peptide-based therapeutics and continuing to decrease the costs of synthesis. However, recent advances in peptide synthesis and bio-nanotechnology augur well for overcoming these issues and providing AMP-based formulations and biomaterials with optimised pharmacokinetic properties at a reasonable cost. </Body>

    <Title>Biophysical Reviews: slowly getting back to ‘normal’?</Title>
    <Doi>10.1007/s12551-021-00797-7</Doi>
    <Authors>Hall Damien</Authors>
    <Abstact>Run by the International Union for Pure and Applied Biophysics (IUPAB) and published by Springer Nature, Biophysical Reviews is an international journal dedicated to publishing topical review articles in the areas of (i) biology-related physics, (ii) structural biology, and (iii) molecular biology. This Editorial for Volume 13, Issue 2 of Biophysical Reviews provides a brief summary of the contents of the current Issue and then describes some matters important to the journal for 2021.</Abstact>
    <Body>Each Issue of  Biophysical Reviews  is divided into two sections, the front matter section that consists of informative Editorials, Commentaries, and Letters and the review body section, which contains short- and long-form scientific review articles. In this Editorial (Hall  2021 ), the reader is first provided with a short informal summary of the contributions in these two sections, before then going on to describe the upcoming Special Issues appearing in the journal during 2021. The Editorial concludes with a short explanation of the mechanism for arranging Special Issues (SI) within the journal and lists the benefits available to SI Editors electing to do so. The first article to immediately follow this Editorial is this Issue’s edition of the ‘Meet the Editors series’—this time focused on Prof. Addmore Shonhai (University of Venda, South Africa) (Shonhai  2021 ). As with all of these Meet the Editors scientific biographies, the reader is given both a personal and professional glimpse of the author’s life in and around science. Growing up in a country devastated by war, Addmore has had to overcome significantly more challenges than most to become a scientist and establish a successful research career (becoming both Professor and Head of a research institute). Aside from being a fascinating read, the piece highlights Addmore’s academic and commercial links with the biophysical, pharmaceutical, and molecular biology communities of South Africa (Shonhai  2021 ), and in this regard, it is worth pointing out that he is one of just two members of the Editorial Board located in continental Africa 1 . Over the coming years, the journal hopes to expand its reach into different regions of the world with Africa a key part of this planned future development.  Biophysical Reviews  would like to thank Prof. Shonhai for his service to date and the journal notes that it is, both lucky to have him, and extremely grateful for his time. The next article in the front section is a Commentary from the four Special Issue (SI) Editors of the upcoming SI on the 20 th  International Union for Pure and Applied Biophysics (IUPAB) (Itri et al.  2021 ). The triennial IUPAB Congress is typically the largest international meeting in the biophysics field with literally thousands of attendees. Acting as both an advisory on the altered nature of this year’s meeting as well as a call for submissions for the associated Special Issue, all participants attending or thinking of attending should read this Commentary carefully to see how they may also be able to participate in the SI dedicated to the meeting (Itri et al.  2021 ). The final article of the front section is a Letter from Iraq arising from a collaboration between the Department of Physics (University of Basrah) and the Basrah City Public Health Offices (Mohi et al.  2021 ). This Letter describes the application of multiple laser optical traps to characterize the difference in cellular elasticity of red blood cells isolated from either healthy patients or patients suffering from sickle cell anemia. As an interesting demonstration of physics applied to medicine, this article deserves to be widely read (Mohi et al.  2021 ). The first review of Issue 2 is a contribution from four research institutes located near Saarbrücken in Germany (Vesperini et al.  2021 ). This fascinating article deals with the topic of ‘immune surveillance’—a general term used to describe how immune cells responsible for killing invading pathogens (via phagocytosis 2 ) both detect their presence and migrate to the site of the pathogen. Concerned with quantifying this behavior in vitro, the bulk of the review describes the results of clever experiments that use microfabrication techniques to create ‘mini-obstacle courses’ for cultured immune cells, along with methods for observing and recording the timing of their completion (Vesperini et al.  2021 ). The second review article contributed from the Haryana region of India (Singh et al.  2021 ) is concerned with the general topic of sarcopenia (muscle loss) and how the wasting of muscle is regulated via quite complex cross-talk between two signaling pathways respectively responsible for autophagy and ubiquitin directed proteolysis (Ubiquitin-Proteasome System, UPS). This Review discusses correlations between various signaling pathway components and their expression levels and through its exposition highlights the often-real barrier to quantitative/biophysical entry into a complex field—namely that some general descriptive model must first be in place (Singh et al.  2021 ). The third review article is a collaborative effort from researchers in the UK that concerns antimicrobial vaccines in which signature carbohydrate groups covalently attached to a pathogen’s outer membrane are used as the immuno-eliciting agent (Bazhenova et al.  2021 ). Focusing on vaccine development against diarrhea inducing enteric microbes, Salmonella and Shigella, this Review examines both the determinants of carbohydrate antigenicity (such as peptide-carbohydrate ligation strategies for enhancing antigen presentation and the branch-point chemistry of the carbohydrate itself) as well as biophysical and computational methods for analyzing/predicting the carbohydrate epitope structure. The use of a flexible carbohydrate as the principal immune-eliciting component represents a different paradigm to the standard protein-based approach to vaccine development and this review article makes an excellent (and extremely timely) contribution to the discussion of vaccine technology in the current climate (Bazhenova et al.  2021 ). The next review is a single-author submission from a research scientist at SCION, one of New Zealand’s Crown Research Institutes (CRI), established to advance basic and applied research in biotechnology (Mabbitt  2021 ). This article deals with the relatively new topic of engineering protein ligation relays—biochemical pathways in which one protein is attached with extreme specificity to another through a cascade of intermediate shuttle protein reactions. In approaching this subject, the author casts a wide historical net, first reviewing the simpler related problem of chemical ligation of dyes to certain protein surface groups e.g. amino (lysine) and thiol (cysteines) chemical moieties. As reviewed by the author, the chemistry of such simpler dye ligand covalent attachment problems can be ‘improved’ through bioengineering, into more complex ligation relay type systems by employing both a bio-recognition element (to direct and mediate the covalent reaction) and a reporter handle (such as green fluorescent protein) that allows localization and quantification of the attached molecule (Mabbitt  2021 ). The fifth review provides a focused description of a particular class of broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs known as sulfonamides (Ovung and Bhattacharyya  2021 ). Covering the history of their invention, their synthesis and pharmacology, their quantum-level structure, and their current potential as starting blocks in the development of more potent drugs, this review article provides a welcome window through which to better appreciate this somewhat neglected class of drugs (Ovung and Bhattacharyya  2021 ). The final review article is a collective effort submitted by scientists from Australia and the UK (Winzor et al.  2021 ). The topic of this review is concerned with the nature of a correction factor employed in analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) studies using the sedimentation velocity technique. Since the derivation of the basic theory governing the migration of a dilute solute in a centrifugal field (Svedberg and Nichols  1923 ; Lamm  1929 ; Svedberg and Pedersen  1940 ), an equivalent description at arbitrary concentration has been sought. Experimentally, the question of assessing the concentration dependence would at first seem straightforward, simply involving plotting the average concentration employed in the experiment against the determined parameter (e.g. the sedimentation coefficient). However, all who have done an AUC experiment realize that the concentration changes over time (due to diffusion and heterogeneity) and radius (due to radial dilution) making the exact averaging technique employed a complicated function of the experiment. This review provides a fascinating historical assessment of how this problem has been solved in the past along with descriptions on modern-day approaches (Winzor et al.  2021 ). Special issues for 2021 Typically, all special issues (SIs) appearing in  Biophysical Reviews  are decided the previous year after suitable consultation between the  Biophysical Reviews’  Editorial Board Members, the SI Guest Editorial Teams proposing the SIs, and the Springer Nature professional staff, with these SIs announced in Issue 1. However, these last 12 months of pandemic have been anything but typical with a lot of vagary as to whether meetings would (or even could) proceed. Not surprisingly, these uncertainties manifested within the SI lineups for 2021. However, with notable resilience, the scientific community has adapted and workarounds involving massive online meetings and small group Zoom/Skype calls have become common enough to constitute a ‘new normal.’ So, somewhat late, but with the spirit of hopefully returning to ‘normal,’ I list here the SIs for 2021 along with their SI Editors.
 The 20 th 
 International IUPAB Congress (in conjunction with Brazilian Biophysical Society and Brazilian Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology) (SI Editors: Rosangela Itri, Mauricio Baptista, Richard Garratt, and Antonio Jose Costa-Filho) Cardiovascular Mechanobiology: State of the art and the newest insights into the role of mechanical forces in cardiovascular development, physiology, and disease (SI Editors Pamela: Swiatlowska and Thomas Iskratsch) More details about these SIs can be gotten by contacting the authors directly, with their details found on the journal website: https://www.springer.com/journal/12551/editors Your SI in  Biophysical Reviews - The benefits To parallel a previous piece on the ‘benefits of writing a review article’ (Hall  2019 ), I thought it might be worthwhile 3  to point out the benefits, provided to all potential Guest Editors, when organizing an SI within  Biophysical Reviews. 
 i. Powerful friends :  Biophysical Reviews  is the sole journal of the International Union for Pure and Applied Biophysics (IUPAB). With sixty-four national biophysical society affiliates and with International Science Council (ISC) backing, IUPAB is the single international body championing and promoting biophysics at the policy, funding, and development levels. If your subject matter is biophysics, then  Biophysical Reviews  is the most pedigreed of the international journals in this area. More can be read about IUPAB and the ISC at the following web addresses: ISC:  https://council.science/about-us/ IUPAB:  http://iupab.org/ ii. Professional services :  Biophysical Reviews  is jointly owned in a 50:50 arrangement between IUPAB and the Springer Nature Corporation. As one of the two largest scientific publishing houses in the world, Springer Nature is able to apply its considerable experience and professional services in the areas of manuscript handling, editorial processing, and article production. The journal has three full-time professional staff (an Editorial Assistant, a Production Manager, and a Journal Manager) along with a number of part-time professional staff involved in desktop publishing. As part of the Springer Nature commitment to ethics in publishing, the journal follows the Committee on Publishing Ethics (COPE) guidelines in its manuscript handling procedures (COPE  2021 ). iii. Significant impact : Whilst pointing out that a journal’s metrics do not necessarily always correlate with the scientific importance of the articles published within, it would be naive not to acknowledge that such metrics sway authors’ perception and consideration for choosing a venue for publication. Within the search category of biophysics in the three major free-to-use journal assessment tools, Elsevier’s Scopus–based SCIMAGO (SCIMAGO  2021 ), Leiden University’s Center for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS  2021 ), and Google’s Scholar Journal Rank (Scholar  2021 ),  Biophysical Reviews  is ranked as follows: SCIMAGO—12 th  of 136 (based on SJR ranking) CWTS—12 th  of 112 (based on SNIP ranking) Scholar—15 th  overall (based on h5 ranking) iv. Eye on cost : Increasingly, many legitimate journals operate on a mandatory open-access fee basis—a situation which can be problematic when not made clear to SI Editors and SI contributors beforehand 4 . In this regard, it is important to note the following about  Biophysical Reviews  fee structure. To maintain its accessibility to scientists from all corners of the world, the journal operates a hybrid open-access system, meaning that it has two tracks of payment available to all authors irrespective of location:
 Free to publish (no cost) option (0 Euros) Gold open access option (~2500 Euros) The free-to-publish option involves placing the published article behind a paywall for a period for 6 to 12 months before it then becomes freely available for download through PubMed Central. However, due to the fact that most large institutions carry the Springer catalogue of journals and that Springer operates special free access platforms in many less-developed countries, any serious downsides for authors electing to use the free to publish track are rarely seen in practice. Although the gold open access approach is the superior format for authors with funds to pay for it (also benefitting from Springer’s post publication cross promotion services) both publishing tracks offer an excellent outcome and the free to publish option is invaluable for authors with more more modest funding arrangements.
 xxii. Social media (Twitter/YouTube) : The  Biophysical Reviews  journal operates two social media channels on Twitter and YouTube that it uses to promote each article 1 month after its initial publication. The journal has been an early advocate of an online sharing tool provided by Springer Nature, known as SharedIt, that allows for free reposting of each author’s work in a completely unrestricted manner on any social media site (Hall  2017 ). Practically speaking, these free sharing links can be used to promote one’s work to the maximum of the author’s inclination and comfort level in doing so! The journal web page and the two social media sites operated by the journal are shown below. Web:  https://www.springer.com/journal/12551 Twitter: @BiophysicalRev1 YouTube:  www.youtube.com/channel/UCzG_5MWmnrB2UBibtxs2DuA vi. Two bespoke SI formats : At the planning and consultation stage, SI Editors are offered the option of two formats: Special issue format—a minimum of ten published articles (consisting of an Editorial, Commentaries, Letters, and short- and long-format review articles) with the entire issue devoted to the Special Issue topic. Issue focus format—in which a five-article space (consisting of a sub-Editorial, Commentaries, Letters, and short- and long-format review articles) is blocked off within a regular issue. These two formats offer SI Editors a lot of flexibility in the design and construction of the SI with the one caveat being that due to the fact that they possess the entire Issue, full SIs must be committed to once chosen. Concluding remarks Both prospective SI Editors, interested in compiling an SI, and prospective authors, interested in submitting a single review article to  Biophysical Reviews , are encouraged to first broach the matter with either the Biophysical Reviews Chief Editor or their local Executive or Editorial Board Member. After discussion on the suitability of their topic, an appropriate timetable for their submission will be arranged in conjunction with the professional officers of the journal. </Body>

    <Title>Effects of macromolecular crowding on intracellular diffusion from a single particle perspective</Title>
    <Doi>10.1007/s12551-010-0029-0</Doi>
    <Authors>Hall Damien, Hoshino Masaru</Authors>
    <Abstact>Compared to biochemical reactions taking place in relatively well-defined aqueous solutions in vitro, the corresponding reactions happening in vivo occur in extremely complex environments containing only 60–70% water by volume, with the remainder consisting of an undefined array of bio-molecules. In a biological setting, such extremely complex and volume-occupied solution environments are termed ‘crowded’. Through a range of intermolecular forces and pseudo-forces, this complex background environment may cause biochemical reactions to behave differently to their in vitro counterparts. In this review, we seek to highlight how the complex background environment of the cell can affect the diffusion of substances within it. Engaging the subject from the perspective of a single particle’s motion, we place the focus of our review on two areas: (1) experimental procedures for conducting single particle tracking experiments within cells along with methods for extracting information from these experiments; (2) theoretical factors affecting the translational diffusion of single molecules within crowded two-dimensional membrane and three-dimensional solution environments. We conclude by discussing a number of recent publications relating to intracellular diffusion in light of the reviewed material.</Abstact>
    <Body>Introduction In colloidal and polymer chemistry, the theoretical description of diffusion in non-turbulent fluids 1  has reached a high level of predictive capability primarily due to the ability to test and refine the theory using relatively well-defined experimental systems (Doi and Edwards  1999 ; Batchelor  2000 ; Byron Bird et al.  2002 ). In contrast, a predictive theory of diffusion in cell biology has yet to be attained due to the general lack of system definition associated with the type of reaction vessels, i.e. there are many different cell types, with each cell’s internal composition capable of dramatic variation over the very small spatial and temporal scales associated with diffusive motion. Indeed, as indicated by Fig.  1 , we are often largely ignorant of the exact chemical surroundings in which our diffusing probe is moving, making the application of complex theory problematic. As a result, our measurements become largely phenomenological in nature and lack ready transferability to other situations. Deciphering observations of diffusive motion made in the complex patchwork collection of microstructures within the cell requires that the discussion of diffusion be conducted within a reductionist framework. In such an approach, general physical principles espoused from the consideration of more highly resolved situations are used to help interpret observations made from small regions of the intracellular molecular landscape (Baumeister  2004 ). It is towards this viewpoint that we have tailored this review. In the belief that the next step towards a quantitative accounting of intracellular diffusion will be assisted by benchmark conceptualizations of the process, we have reviewed some of the general physical features associated with diffusion in crowded solutions from the perspective of a single molecule’s Brownian motion, giving a simple introduction to the factors responsible for the phenomenon and highlighting methods capable of extracting maximum information from the data. The subject of diffusion is a perennial favourite for review, with many excellent examples on different aspects of the topic (Berg  1993 ; Saxton and Jacobson  1997 ; Peskir  2003 ; Frey and Kroy  2005 ; Philibert  2006 ; Dix and Verkman  2008 ; Saxton  2008 ). Aware of this fact, we have tried our best to approach the subject matter in a manner that will hopefully prove useful as both a practical and conceptual aid for those actually engaging with the complexities of diffusion in the cell using single particle tracking methods as their experimental avatar.
 Fig. 1 Interrogating Brownian motion in the ‘black box’ of the cell. A labeled ( white ) particle’s motion is followed in ( top ) the two-dimensional (2D) plane of the cell membrane (shown here as composed of various lipid domains and integral membrane proteins in contact extracellularly with polysaccharides and intracellularly with the cortical cytoskeleton) and ( bottom ) in the three-dimensional (3D) space of the cell cytosol (shown here as composed of various soluble proteins, cytoskeletal elements, nucleic acids, lipids, carbohydrates and inorganic ions) 
 Some diffusion basics Particles in fluids undergo near continual random displacements due to collisions and subsequent momentum transfer with the surrounding solvent molecules—a situation termed ‘Brownian motion’. 2  For a large number of particles initially located near to the same region in space, such Brownian motion has the consequence that the particles will tend to disperse over time, this situation being known as diffusion (Fig.  2 ). At the macroscopic level, the dispersal of the concentration profile of an arbitrary ideal solute component i, C i ( r ,t), can be described by Fick’s second law of diffusion 3  (Eq.  1a ), which is an equation relating the partial time derivative of the concentration to its second partial spatial derivative using a phenomenological 4  coefficient of diffusion, D i  (units of m 2 s -1 ). At the time of its development, the diffusion coefficient was interpreted as a simple constant denoting a shared characteristic of the diffusing component i and the operative solution conditions under which the experiment was conducted. Throughout the period from 1905 to 1908, three scientists, Einstein (Einstein  1956 ), Smoluchowski (Fulinski  1998 ) and Langevin (Langevin  1908 ), all using different approaches, were able to provide a theoretical link between the phenomenological diffusion coefficient utilized by Fick and the system properties governing the individual particle displacements, ∆ r

 In this description, k is Boltzmann’s constant, T is the absolute temperature, f i  is the particle’s frictional constant, and d is the dimensionality of the Cartesian space involved in the diffusion process. These theoretical predictions relating the diffusion coefficient to the sampling observation time and the particle mean squared displacement (MSD) were confirmed experimentally in the following years by optical microscopy-based observations of colloidal behaviour made by Perrin and co-workers (Perrin  1910 ) and sedimentation dispersion profiles measured by Svedberg and colleagues in the newly invented analytical ultracentrifuge (Svedberg and Pederson  1940 ). Importantly, both the theoretical assumptions used to derive Eqs.  1a  and  1b  as well as the experimental requirements necessary for achieving agreement with the theory, require that the solute particles be dilute and non-interacting—situations which are far removed from the reality inside the cell. Experimental measurement of single particle motion within the cell In correspondence with the macroscopic and particle level descriptions of diffusion embodied by Eqs.  1a  and  1b , there are two general approaches for experimental determination of the diffusion coefficient: methods that measure the time-dependent behaviour of a large number (virtual continuum) of particles over relatively large regions of space and methods that involve observing the properties of individual particles over a small region of space. Experimental techniques belonging to the former category include pulsed gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (Stejskal and Tanner  1965 ; Morris and Johnson Jr.  1992 ; Regan and Kuchel  2003 ), electron spin resonance (ESR) procedures (Regan and Kuchel  2003 ; Mirosavljević and Noethig-Laslo  2008 ), optical microscopy-based observation of light-absorbing or light-emitting solutes (Guo et al.  2008 ; Lorén et al.  2009 ), neutron scattering (Doster and Longeville  2007 ) and single- and multi-wavelength dynamic light scattering experiments (Peetermans et al.  1987 ). Experimental methods belonging to the later category, i.e. methods capable of observing intracellular single molecule diffusive motion at the microsecond and 100-nm level of precision (approximately) are largely due to technological advances in optical microscopy (Diaspro  2002 ; Elson  2004 ; Murcia et al.  2007 ; Guo et al.  2008 ). Particular promising from the viewpoint of deciphering the effects of underlying internal cellular structure are the single particle molecule tracking (SPT) techniques (Saxton and Jacobson  1997 ; Kusumi et al.  2005 ; Murcia et al.  2007 ) and the confocal based fluctuation microscopy approaches (Elson  2004 ; Weiss  2008 ). As the confocal based fluctuation approaches have been recently reviewed, both in this journal and elsewhere (Elson  2004 ; Weiss  2008 ; Chiantia et al.  2009 ; Jameson et al.  2009 ), we place our focus in this review on the SPT approach. Optical microscope based SPT experiments involve recording the trajectory of a single molecule possessing either some naturally occurring detectable feature or an attached label (Fig.  3 ). The most common formats for realization of this procedure involve tagging the diffusing component of interest with a fluorescent compound having a high quantum yield (e.g. fluorescent proteins attached via molecular biology procedures (Hibino et al.  2009 ) or modern fluorescent ‘laser’ dyes and quantum dots (Alcor et al.  2009 ) which can be visualized using various implementations of fluorescence microscopy. Alternatively, differentially polarizable materials (e.g. small metal or latex colloidal particles) which are capable of being observed using standard bright field or interference based microscopy approaches (de Brabander et al.  1991 ; Geerts et al.  1991 ; Kusumi et al.  2005 ) can be attached to the molecule of interest. The choice of format for particle detection is usually dictated by the experimental problem at hand in conjunction with the photophysical properties (e.g. fluorescence excitation/emission bands, fluorescence lifetime, ‘blinking’ artefacts) and physical compatibility (size and chemical properties of the label in relation to the tracer molecule of interest). In the cases where a molecular biology based approach is not adopted, the labelled tracer can be introduced into the cell via passive uptake, liposome fusion, electroporation or micro-injection (Kusumi et al.  2005 ; Alcor et al.  2009 ). Once in place, a video or digital movie camera attached to the microscope is used to record the Brownian motion of the individual particles. The coupling of highly sensitive camera equipment (CCD or CMOS) with modern microscope developments, such as cylindrical objective lenses with multi-focus capabilities (Kao and Verkman  1994 ), confocal and multiphoton methods (Diaspro  2002 ; Hellriegel and Gratton  2009 ) and evanescent wave-based total internal reflection illumination procedures for recording close to surfaces, has meant that time-dependent single particle tracking (SPT) experiments are able to be performed in both the two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D, respectively) intracellular spaces (e.g. the cell membranes and cytosol) at relatively high temporal and spatial frequencies.

 Extracting information about the diffusive properties of the observed tracer particle involves analysing the particle’s position trajectory,  r (t) (Fig.  3 ), by repetitive calculation of the position difference vector, ∆ r , over an arbitrary time interval, n∆t (Eq.  2 ).

 For a given integer multiplier, n, of the smallest recorded sampling time interval, ∆t, the diffusion tensor of component i,  D 
 i , (Batchelor  2000 ; Fernandes and de la Torre  2002 ) may be calculated by sufficiently averaging the successive product of the position difference vector with its transpose, both throughout the trajectory and, where possible, by averaging from multiple particles migrating through the same region of space.

 The diffusion tensor as calculated by Eq.  3  provides a measure of the isotropy 6  of the system. For isotropic systems, all diagonal elements of  D  will be equal, and all non-diagonal elements will average to zero, thereby allowing a description of the system by a single diffusion constant D = D xx  = D yy  = D zz . When this condition is not met, a rotational matrix,  R , can be applied to the diffusion tensor with the condition of producing a transformed diffusion tensor  D′  that is diagonal in nature and necessarily defined in terms of a Cartesian coordinate system x′,y′,z′ that lies along the principle axes of the anisotropy (Eq.  4 )

 The system isotropy can be visualized graphically by making the diagonal terms of the diffusion tensor the characteristic measures of an ellipsoid lying along the axes specified by the rotational transform (Fig.  4 ). For the isotropic case in which diffusion along all three axes will be equally likely the representation will be a sphere.

 Calculation of the tensor elements at different sampling time intervals, n∆t, provides additional information on the so-called anomalous nature of the diffusion constant. In this approach, each tensor element calculated at the limiting sampling time interval is effectively modified by an empirical function, f(n∆t), of the sampling time interval. A common form of the function, f(n∆t) = (n∆t) (α) , is shown in Eq.  5  in which the parameter α is termed the anomalous diffusion coefficient.

 For normal diffusion, the modifying functional parameter, α, is equal to 1 (Fig.  4 c. d). For the case of super-diffusion (D i  increasing with time), α is ≥ 1 (Fig.  4 e), and in the case of sub-diffusion (D i  decreasing with time), α is ≤1 (Fig.  4 f). Although the problem is essentially an inverse one, many researchers have used an iterative process of model building and simulation to provide an interpretation of experimentally observed anomalous diffusion in terms of cellular structural characteristics or local solution conditions (Goulian and Simon  2000 ; Jin and Verkmann  2007 ; Sanabria et al.  2007 ; Saxton  2007 , Saxton  2008 ; Weiss  2008 ). We cite it here as an important descriptor of the diffusion process in crowded solutions (Banks and Fradin  2005 ; Ridgway et al.  2008 ; Weiss  2008 ). It also serves as an important reminder of the importance of asserting the sampling interval time when comparing tracer diffusion coefficients. Indeed, the two limiting forms corresponding to short time n∆t → 0 and long time n∆t →∞ are commonly used for comparative purposes (Bernadó et al.  2004 ). Theoretical description of Brownian motion within the cell Parallel to the advances in technology that have made high spatial, high temporal frequency single particle tracking a relatively straightforward technique, corresponding developments in computing power have meant that coarse grained particle modelling of cell like situations have started to become a possible, if not routine, addition to the biophysicist’s bag of tools, providing a much required extra level of discrimination in the construction and testing of cellular level biological hypotheses. In general the particle based models available for simulating intracellular diffusion involve the specification of a set number of solute particles within a boundary enclosing volume representing the cell wall (Andrews and Bray  1994 ; Jeschke  2008 ; Czech et al.  2009 ; Moraru et al.  2009 ; Takahashi et al.  2005 ; Wils and De Schutter  2009 ). If one considers the average cell size to be defined by a length scale approximately 10 μm and the average protein radius approximately 2 nm, then it becomes obvious that a full particle representation of the components of the cell is beyond current computing capabilities as it would involve on the order of 1 × 10 10  particles. To subvert this problem models of intracellular diffusion are ‘coarse grained’ i.e. they are simplified by reducing the number of components and the level of detail. Such modelling approaches often involve simplifications in which Brownian motion characteristics are considered to be independent of the surrounding local environment, and particle interactions (if considered) are incorporated at the level of like/dislike rule based algorithms. Contrarily, much of the higher order theory already developed for the description of diffusion in concentrated solution environments cannot feasibly be employed due to the problems discussed in the introduction relating to general ignorance of the cellular solution composition. In the following section we discuss some of the factors affecting the Brownian motion of single particles in crowded environments and then we review some different levels of approximation for carrying out particle model simulations at different time and length scales commensurate with the level of knowledge of the fine structure of the cell. Factors affecting the Brownian motion of single particles in crowded environments The Langevin approximation (Langevin  1908 ; Dhont  1996 ; Snook  2006 ) of Brownian motion formalises the particle model approach by considering the solution as an implicit background of solvent containing a number of explicitly recognized particles. As such the Newtonian acceleration of the i th  particle can be calculated as the net force due to the combination of intermolecular potentials acting between explicitly considered particles, ( F 
 p ) i , a frictional forces arising from the tendency of the solvent to resist directed motion, ( F 
 f ) i , and random forces resulting from unbalanced collisions with the solvent molecules, ( F 
 r ) i . When the number of explicitly recognised particles is low the Langevin description approaches its dilute limiting form (Eq.  6a ). However at elevated ‘crowded’ conditions the intermolecular potentials become significant and must be accounted for (Eq.  6b ).

 Although the Langevin equation has limited potential in the simulation of diffusion in crowded systems due to its requirement for short time scales during numerical integration, it provides a very useful pedagogical aid for developing a mechanical understanding of the subject. For now we note that in the concentrated limit the Langevin equation is composed of three force terms,  F 
 p ,  F 
 f  and  F 
 r , each of which we will discuss in the sections below. Forces resulting from intermolecular potentials ( F p ) Although the term macromolecular crowding is used in biology to describe the special role played by the cell’s crowded microenvironment on the biochemical reactions occurring within it, the effects of crowding are, as for all chemical reactions, physically manifested through the existence of intermolecular potentials acting between individual particles. To a first approximation, the properties of solutions can be described on the basis of the summation of external forces acting on each of the individual particles and the summed contribution of the individual particle-particle pairwise interaction potentials (Elimelech et al.  1995 ; Leach  2001 ) (Eq.  7 ).

 The types of potential specified depend upon the level of detail included in the description of tracer and background molecules (Elimelech et al.  1995 ; Leach  2001 ; Elcock  2003 ; McGuffee and Elcock  2006 ; Qin and Zhou  2009 ).

In this review, we regard the tracer particle (particle i) and crowding background molecule (particle j) as spheres of respective radii R i  and R j . In general, the intermolecular potentials all feature some form of repulsive interaction at short range that physically arises from electronic repulsion. At longer distances, the interaction may take on attractive or repulsive characteristics empirically defined in terms of a potential energy depth ε and a screening length, L ij . The potentials described in Fig.  5  and Table  1  are assumed to have spherical symmetry and hence are functions of intermolecular distance, d ij , only  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

 Although the described potential functions and the forces derived from them are not realistic, they serve both heuristic and practical purposes in that they are (1) easy to comprehend, (2) easy to incorporate into simulations and (3) represent an advance to just ignoring these features. Additional features, such as the dependence of the interparticle potentials on such things as ionic strength, can be incorporated phenomenologically by the inclusion of scaling terms in the potential depth and screening length terms (Elimelech et al.  1995 ). Forces resulting from friction exerted by the solvent ( F f ) At limiting dilution in non-turbulent flows, a tracer particle of characteristic size &lt;10 μm undergoing motion relative to a viscous solvent environment will experience a frictional force opposing its motion that is equal to the negative product of the velocity of the particle,  v 
 i  (relative to the velocity of the surrounding fluid), and a frictional constant, f i , characteristic of the shape of the particle (Dhont  1996 ; Byron Bird et al.  2002 ) (Eq.  9a ). For spherical particles undergoing translational motion in a 3D solvent environment, f i  is given by Stokes law (Eq.  9b : Jones  2002 ; Byron Bird et al.  2002 ). Proteins and lipids in the two dimensions of the cell membrane are usually modelled as upright cylinders (of characteristic radius R i  and cylinder height, H i ) with the frictional coefficient of such a cylinder given by Eq.  9c  (Saffman and Delbrűck  1975 ). In Eqs.  9b  and  c , η and η′ are the dynamic viscosities (units kg m -1 s -1 ) of the solvent or membrane, respectively. Typical values for η and η′ at 37°C are ∼1 × 10 -4  and ∼1 × 10 -1  kg m -1  s -1 , respectively (Byron Bird et al.  2002 ; Spooner et al.  2000 ;).

 At non-dilute concentrations, the simple expressions for the frictional force described in Eqs.  9  becomes suspect due to the fact that all particles undergoing directed motion 7  through a solvent environment must necessarily exert force on the surrounding solvent, which in turn communicates that force to other nearby regions of fluid. This means that the relative velocity between the particle and the surrounding solution environment can no longer be simply equated with the velocity of the particle with respect to an ideal consideration of its local streamline. This additional component to the frictional force, known as the hydrodynamic interaction (HI) force, becomes more pronounced with increasing concentration and level of volume occupation. Consequently, recognition of these HI effects in studies on macromolecular crowding is desirable. Within the Langevin framework, hydrodynamic interactions can be incorporated by including supporting functions containing various degrees of information on the positions, velocities and precise geometries of all N explicitly considered simulation components (Eq.  10a ) (Rotne and Prager  1969 ; Ermak and McCammon  1978 ; Batchelor  1982 ; Fernandes and de la Torre  2002 ; Padding and Louis  2006 ; Geyer and Winter  2009 ). As such a precise level of system definition is often lacking when conducting investigations of diffusion within the cell, coarser methods for factoring in HI forces based on effective viscosity have been attempted (Heyes  1995 ; Wade  1996 ; Urbina-Villalba et al.  2003 ; Sun and Weinstein  2007 ). In this approach, a localized mean field approximation is used to calculate an appropriately averaged scalar value of the frictional coefficient, &lt; f 
 i &gt;, over the displacement ∆ r  (Eq.  10b )

 In practice the average frictional coefficient, &lt; f 
 i &gt;, is approximated from the known value of the short-time diffusion constant 8  of a tracer particle in a hard particle fluid, with the value either derived from experimental data (Urbina-Villalba et al.  2003 ) or made using a higher order theoretical method for implementation of hydrodynamic interactions (e.g. Fernandes and de la Torre  2002 ; Falck et al.  2004 ; Geyer and Winter  2009 ). For calculations of tracer diffusion within a solution of identical particles, these averaged values for &lt;f i  &gt; in three dimensions (written in terms of fractional volume ϕ) or two dimensions (written in terms of fractional area θ) are presented as Eqs.  11a  and  11b , respectively.

 i  . As an example, Fig.  6  describes the altered frictional force resulting from HI effects experienced by a tracer protein R i  = 2 nm) in an enclosed 2D membrane at either limiting dilution or under crowded conditions (θ = 0.4). The equations derived above should be seen as a first order inclusion of HI as they ignore differences in the perpendicular and parallel components of the viscosity predicted by higher order theory (Elimelech et al.  1995 ; Dhont  1996 ; Batchelor  2000 ).

 Forces resulting from random collisions with the solvent ( F r ) The final term required for specification of Eq.  5  is the stochastic force variable, [ F 
 r (∆t)] i , written here as a function of the time interval, ∆t, specifying the frequency with which it is updated. A simple conceptualization of the random force term that offers physical insight is that of a thermostat-regulating function (Langevin  1908 ; Snook  2006 ) through which it combats the tendency of the viscous frictional force to slow the system down (and hence cool it). The most common procedure for assigning a numerical value to [ F 
 r (∆t)] i  involves requiring that it conforms to relations derived from application of the fluctuation dissipation theorem (Eq.  12 ) (Kubo  1966 ).

It can be shown (Kubo  1966 ) that these requirements are satisfied by selecting the random component forces (ξ) from a Gaussian distribution (Eq.  12c ) with a standard deviation, σ, given by  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The magnitude of σ can be seen to be dependent upon the sampling time, 10  the temperature and the local frictional coefficient (Saxton  2008 ). The mathematics behind the result presented in Eq.  12  can be relatively difficult to follow so here we offer a simple argument which although only yielding an approximate result provides some useful insight into the physical origins of the random force and the natural time constant of the system. In this simplified model, the average kinetic energy of the system is first equated with the average thermal energy via the equipartition theorem, i.e.  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Over time scales sufficiently small enough to preserve inertial memory, we can equate the average magnitude of the random force with the average absolute value of the frictional force (Eq.  13a ), with this relationship being further developed by combination with the relation for the average particle velocity to determine the magnitude of the random force term (Eq.  13b ).

 From a dimensional analysis of Eq.  13b , it can be noted that m/&lt;f i &gt; has units of time and can thus be interpreted as specifying a natural time constant for the system, such that  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

For specification of larger time intervals ∆t &gt;&gt; ∆τ, such a direct physical interpretation of the random force term breaks down due to the fact that the path taken between the application of the intervening stochastic random forces is not linear, but rather occurs as the result of a random walk produced by many collisions, each occurring at or around the natural time constant of the system. In this time regime, the average motion of the particle is best described as a function of its mean squared displacement (Langevin  1908 ; Einstein  1956 ) (Eq.  1b ). Using that definition of the diffusion coefficient, a phenomenological velocity can be determined over the time step and calculated displacement (Eq.  14 )

 If Eqs.  16a  and  16b  are further integrated over a short time step (∆t &lt; ∆τ) some of the information relating to the velocity previously held by the particle is retained (Eq.  17a ). At longer time steps (∆t &gt; ∆τ) the contributions from the exponential terms becomes relatively minor and a description of the over-damped Brownian dynamics algorithm (Ermack  1975 ; Ermack and McCammon  1978 ) is recovered (Eq.  17b ).

 The upper limit for the time step, τ B  = ∆t, chosen for numerical integration in the Brownian dynamics regime corresponds to a value which prevents particles from passing through each other over the interval. For systems composed of particles of a single radius R i , τ B  ∼ R i 2  &lt;f i &gt;/(2d k B T).

 Discussion of recent experimental findings From the very earliest studies of diffusive motion in the 2D and 3D biological environments of the cell membrane and cell cytosol, strong differences to the simple behaviour predicted for continuum fluids have been observed (e.g. 3D: Jacobson and Wojcieszyn  1984 ; Gershon et al.  1985 ; Arrio-Dupont et al.  2000 ; Goulian and Simon  2000 ; e.g. 2D: Schlessinger et al.  1977 ; Sheetz et al.  1980 ; Haggie and Verkman  2002 ; Sakaki et al.  1982 ). Recently, rather than being interpreted as just unnecessary complications, these effects are now seen as probable design features of the cellular reaction environment that have resulted from the natural optimization process of evolution (Kurganov et al.  1985 ; Bray  1998 ; Luby-Phelps et al.  1988 ; Burdzy and Hołyst  2001 ; Haggie and Verkman  2002 ; Schnell and Turner  2004 ; Sear  2005 ; Ma'ayan et al.  2005 ; Weiss  2008 ). In this vein, the degree of anomalous diffusion in the cytoplasm has been interpreted as a means of tuning the search process for an interacting partner (Burz et al.  2006 ; Iwahara and Clore  2006 ;Tang et al.  2006 ) in crowded solution conditions by helping to both spatially determine the location of the interacting partner and also to enhance the probability of encounter (Weiss  2008 ; Szymanski and Weiss  2009 ). In cells lacking significant compartmentalization and structural organization (e.g. prokaryotes), the intracellular 2D and 3D fluids might be approximated by concentrated macromolecular environments (Zimmerman and Trach  1991 ; Konopka et al.  2006 ). Using the Brownian dynamics algorithm presented in Eq.  17b , we provide example simulations of 2D and 3D diffusion in a crowded solution of particles of identical size (Fig.  7 ). Estimates of the long time tracer diffusion coefficient 12  indicate that for intermediate crowding regimes, the effect of a repulsive potential is to increase the magnitude of the short-time diffusion coefficient by helping to keep the tracer particle out of the ‘stagnant’ region associated with high local densities of background particles. Not surprisingly, the effect of a weakly attractive potential shows the reverse behaviour, with the tracer diffusion coefficient decreasing due to a combination effect arising from the attractive intermolecular potential (i.e. larger particles diffuse more slowly) and the HI forces (i.e. the tracer spends more time located in higher viscosity regions). The purely hard sphere tracer case with no associated potential was also simulated and is intermediate between the two 13 . The time dependence of the diffusion coefficient was also analysed and is displayed in Fig.  7  e, f for the three different types of associated intermolecular potential. All three examples demonstrated anomalous diffusion characteristics (α ≈ 0.85) similar in magnitude to those previously measured (Banks and Fradin  2005 ; Szymanski and Weiss  2009 ).

Central panel  ( c  and  d ) Normalized long-time tracer diffusion coefficients as a function of fractional area, θ, or volume, ϕ: occupation for repulsive saw tooth ( blue ), attractive saw tooth ( black ) and hard particle ( red ) intermolecular potentials operative between tracer and crowder molecules (ε = +k B T, -k B T or 0, L ij  = R i ) (all trajectories were ended before approaching the wall).  Green line  indicates reduction in long-time tracer diffusion for hard particle cases as calculated for unconfined 2D fluids by Bussell et al.  1995  and in unconfined 3D fluids by Tokuyama and Oppenheim  1994 .  Bottom panel  ( e  and  f ) Averaged diagonal elements of the mean squared displacements from the diffusion tensor for repulsive ( blue ), attractive ( black ) and hard particle only ( red ) for the most crowded cases considered in 2D and 3D, respectively 
 The existence within the cell of internal membrane compartments along with the numerous fibrous elements associated with the cellular cytoskeleton means that certain regions of volume (Blum et al.  1989 ; Provance et al.  1993 ; Goulian and Simon  2000 ; Sanabria et al.  2007 ; Klann et al.  2009 ) or area (Sheetz et al.  1980 ; Saxton  1995 ; Kusumi et al.  2005 ) may be effectively caged or confined. The partitioning of the cell membrane into such caged regions has been interpreted as a means for forming reaction modules (Fig.  8 a) (Kurganov et al.  1985 ; Bray  1998 ; Kusumi et al.  2005 ; Ma'ayan et al.  2005 ). For the case of caging (Fig.  8 a), our example simulations are in general agreement with the predictions and observations of hop diffusion (Saxton  1995 ; Saxton  2008 ; Kusumi et al.  2005 ), with the mean squared displacement attaining a horizontal asymptote that is dependent upon the permeability of the confining elements. Interestingly, only small differences are seen for molecules having different limiting case intermolecular potential behaviours, although this difference would be expected to increase with increasing potential magnitude. Additionally, the intrinsic asymmetry of the fibrous elements can impart orientation derived ordering effects similar to those observed in liquid crystal theory (Hentschke and Herzfeld  1989 ; Herzfeld  2004 ), leading to regions that are capable of generating altered diffusion behaviour that is direction-dependent (Blum et al.  1989 ; Han and Herzfeld  1993 ; Kang et al.  2007 ). We highlight some of these different findings in Fig.  8 b and c using example simulations showing the general effects of confinement and ordering for the 2D cases of an open channel (Fig.  8 b) and a confined wedge (Fig.  8 c). Analysis of the diffusion tensor indicates that the structures have an intrinsic anisotropy generating function that is dependent upon both the width and angle of alignment in accordance with previous work (Blum et al.  1989 ; Han and Herzfeld  1993 ; Kang et al.  2007 ).

 Modelling approaches capable of accounting for such complex diffusive behaviour as that described above are required if we are to develop predictive models of intracellular diffusion. Towards the development of a such a predictive theory explicit accounting for the spatial dimension is an important first step. Methods for factoring in the dimensions of the cellular reaction vessels have been implemented in programs such as MCELL (Czech et al.  2009 ), VIRTUAL CELL (Moraru et al.  2009 ), E-CELL (Takahashi et al.  2005 ) and STEPS (Wils and De Schutter  2009 ) by incorporation of structures from confocal or EM image traces. However, as we have noted in this review diffusive, transport processes occurring in solution are not just affected by geometric considerations, but also by a combination of intermolecular potentials, hydrodynamic interactions and random forces effected by the solvent. Recent modelling and simulation efforts have started to address some of these issues (Bicout and Field  1996 ; Andrews and Bray  2004 ; Takahashi et al.  2005 ; Jeschke  2008 ; Czech et al.  2009 ; Moraru et al.  2009 ; Wils and De Schutter  2009 ). It is towards the goal of providing a readily digestible review of the general physical factors affecting Brownian behaviour that we have endeavoured to achieve here. Concluding remarks The general area of study relating to how the complex structured microenvironment of the cell affects the fate of biochemical reactions occurring within it has been termed as ‘macromolecular crowding and confinement’ or simply ‘crowding’ for short (Minton and Wilf  1981 ; Harris and Winzor  1985 ; Minton  1992 ; Zhou et. al.  2008 ). Despite the fascination that ‘biological chemistry’ holds for many, the study of intracellular crowding effects is a difficult subject area in which to both design and conduct experiments and to theoretically interpret the experimental results (Zimmerman and Minton  1993 ; Hall and Minton  2003 ; Zhou et al.  2008 ). In conventional biochemical investigations complications arising from unwanted side-reactions are made tractable via reduction of the number and extent of variable system components (Goto et al  1993 ; Hoshino et al  1997 ). However, even in in vitro model system approximations of crowding, such an option is limited when the objective is to examine the effect of a complex and highly concentrated background environment of the biochemical reaction at hand. The situation becomes more difficult when studying crowding in, in vivo, model systems due to a lack of definition/knowledge of both the composition (Zimmerman and Trach  1993 ; Ma'ayan et al.  2005 ) and position (Luby-Phelps et al.  1988 ; Diaspro  2002 ; Leis et al.  2009 ) of the system components. Often times, the irreducible nature of the experimental system can lead to the presence of multiple competing effects which can confound the ready application of theoretical methods. As such, the ability of modelling approaches for generating easily accessible guiding principles has generally been inversely proportional to their degree of realism (Zimmerman and Minton  1993 ; Schnell and Turner  2004 ; Sear  2005 ; Hall and Dobson  2006 ; McGuffee and Elcock  2006 ; Qin and Zhou  2009 ). Relatively simple models of diffusion in crowded solution have provided considerable insight into diffusive behaviour within cells (Muramatsu and Minton  1988 ; Minton  1989 ; Han and Herzfeld  1993 ; Hall  2008 , Hall  2010 ). Recent advances in both single particle tracking (Saxton and Jacobson  1997 , Kusumi et al.  2005 ; Murcia et al.  2007 ; Hellriegel and Gratton  2009 ) and single particle simulation methods (Bernadó et al.  2004 ; Sun and Weinstein  2007 ; Dix and Verkman  2008 ; Ridgway et. al.  2008 ; Weiss  2008 ) hold the promise that as we move into the new decade our potential to understand diffusive behaviour within the complex confines of the cell will continue to grow – perhaps putting a predictive theory of diffusion within the cell within eventual reach. </Body>

    <Title>Population dynamics of a pathogen: the conundrum of vivax malaria</Title>
    <Doi>10.1007/s12551-010-0034-3</Doi>
    <Authors>McQueen Philip G.</Authors>
    <Abstact>Building a mathematical model of population dynamics of pathogens within their host involves considerations of factors similar to those in ecology, as pathogens can prey on cells in the host. But within the multicellular host, attacked cell types are integrated with other cellular systems, which in turn intervene in the infection. For example, immune responses attempt to sense and then eliminate or contain pathogens, and homeostatic mechanisms try to compensate for cell loss. This review focuses on modeling applied to malarias, diseases caused by single-cell eukaryote parasites that infect red blood cells, with special concern given to vivax malaria, a disease often thought to be benign (if sometimes incapacitating) because the parasite only attacks a small proportion of red blood cells, the very youngest ones. However, I will use mathematical modeling to argue that depletion of this pool of red blood cells can be disastrous to the host if growth of the parasite is not vigorously check by host immune responses. Also, modeling can elucidate aspects of new field observations that indicate that vivax malaria is more dangerous than previously thought.</Abstact>
    <Body>Introduction Population biology is concerned with the dynamics of a population of organisms and influences on those dynamics. For example, consider a herd of zebras on a plain. Lions and hyenas prey on the zebras. If there is a drought, fewer zebras may survive, thus fewer lions and hyenas survive. Lions and hyenas compete against each other, and parasites infect both zebras and predators. A less nutritious grass may invade the plain, etc. From a biophysical standpoint, interactions among the species facilitate the exchange of energy along with nutrients necessary to use that energy. The plain is a substrate on which natural selection acts on the component species and thus shapes their genomes. Mathematical modeling of an ecosystem lets us investigate “what if” situations: given a proposed interaction or process in the ecosystem, what is the logical outcome of the presence of that interaction or process upon the dynamics of the populations in that system? Will these outcomes be robust against perturbations on the system? To quote John Maynard Smith (Maynard Smith  1968 ), modeling (1) “provides a rapid way of discovering the kind of effect various features—for examples, predation, parasitism, territorial behavior, a long or short period of immaturity—may have on the behavior of a population” and (2) “suggests what needs to be measured before the behavior of any particular species can be understood.” A group of pathogenic agents in a multicellular host also forms a population. The pathogen is a predator if it attacks a cell type. But multicellular hosts are usually proactive against an invader, mounting immune responses to kill or limit the pathogen and starting processes to repair the tissue damage. From a modeler’s perspective, perhaps the ecosystem is a morass: we may not know all the components of the host’s response, and of those we do know, we may not know which are most important. Host responses may be self-amplifying, self-regulating, and possibly self-harming. They may differ greatly among individuals of the same species due to genetic background or contingency of environmental exposure. The pathogen might have mechanisms to evade or interfere with host responses. But again, we can use mathematical modeling to answer “what-if” questions, and this in turn can guide researchers in the laboratory or clinic. There are two levels of population dynamics in a host-pathogen system: (1) those of individual cells or virions of the invader as well as host cells and responses, and (2) those of both host population and disease incidence, the subject of epidemiology. In this review, I discuss the application of mathematical modeling to a type of human malaria, with the focus on the within-host dynamics of the pathogen. I will also discuss the significance of the results from both public health and evolutionary standpoints. A conundrum of malaria biology Malarias are diseases of red blood cells (RBCs) in vertebrates caused by 100+ species of single-cell eukaryotes of the genus  Plasmodium , order Haemosporida of the class Apicomplexa. Birds, reptiles, and mammals are targeted (Garnham  1966 ; Perkins and Austin  2009 ). Apicomplexans have a set of specialized organelles, together called the apical complex, that enables them to penetrate the cells of their hosts. All known Apicomplexans are intracellular parasites, and some are human disease agents ( Cryptosporidium parvum ,  Toxoplasma gondii ) or serious livestock pathogens ( Babesia  spp.,  Theileria  spp.). At least five  Plasmodium  spp. infect humans regularly, causing disease characterized by repeating bouts of severe fever and anemia [see Cox-Singh and Singh ( 2008 ) for commentary]. Part of the life cycle of these species is spent in mosquitoes of genus  Anopheles . The mosquitoes serve as vectors that spread the disease from human to human by picking up the gametocytes, the sexual forms of the parasite that mate within the mosquito gut. Mosquitoes transmit to humans the haploid descendants of the mated forms, the sporozoites, which then enter liver cells. The form of parasite that infects RBCs is the merozoites, which are released initially from the liver as the descendants of sporozoites but then later by the bursting of infected RBCs. [Baer et al. ( 2007 ) is an illustrative study of the initial merozoite release.] After a merozoite enters an RBC, its nucleus undergoes rounds of division by schizogony. The infection is sustained among the host’s RBCs in this manner, but some asexual forms become gametocytes in a process that is not well understood. The disease pathology is due to the asexual forms that cannot be transmitted to mosquitoes, although blood transfusion can spread them. Two species,  Plasmodium falciparum  and  Plasmodium vivax , cause the bulk of the public health burden of the malarias. [For review, see White and Breman ( 2008 ) and Miller et al. ( 2002 ).]  P. vivax  attacks mainly reticulocytes, which are RBCs that have aged 36 h or less after differentiation from erythroblasts and that still retain traces of a nucleus. This parasite infects ≈10 8  people per year in both temperate and tropical areas. Infection is temporarily incapacitating, but as I discuss below, its true public health burden is only now becoming apparent.  P. falciparum  can infect RBCs of any age. This species infects ≈5 × 10 8  people each year and causes &gt;10 6  deaths per year, mostly in tropical regions and especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Severe anemia and organ complications, especially in the brain, cause death or long term disability. Figure  1  shows a human RBC parasitized with this species.

 In 2003, Ellis McKenzie of the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, approached me with a conundrum: It was assumed that  P. vivax  caused less severe disease than  P. falciparum  because a mere 1.25% of RBCs are reticulocytes (Krogstad  1995 ). Yet data from neurosyphilis patients who were infected with  P. vivax  showed that this parasite has a rather large growth rate early in infection, with parasites from a single infected RBC infecting up to 15 other RBCs (McKenzie et al.  2002 ). (Before penicillin came into use, the induction of antibacterial fever by malaria was the standard of treatment for neurosyphilis.) This was similar to the initial growth rate of parasitemia seen in  P. falciparum  infections in neurosyphilis patients (Collins and Jeffery  1999 ) and other patient groups (White  1997 ). Could  P. vivax  cause severe anemia by depleting the reticulocyte population, thus choking off replacements for aging RBCs removed by the spleen? If so, what makes  P. vivax  supposedly less dangerous than  P. falciparum ? We set about modeling the dynamics of the parasite population in an hypothetical patient to address this question. This review describes the results of our efforts. Incidentally, there are many fine theoretical studies of the within-host population dynamics of malaria parasites that attempt to address several aspects of malaria infection. For a selection, see Gravenor et al. ( 1995 ), Hoshen et al. ( 2000 ), Gravenor et al. ( 2002 ), Rouzine and McKenzie ( 2003 ), Haydon et al. ( 2003 ), Maire et al. ( 2006 ), Chiyaka et al. ( 2009 ), and Thibodeaux ( 2010 ). Starting with Malthus We first considered the following question: what would happen if parasitemia grew to the maximum level constrained only by availability of RBCs, with no immune response from the host against the parasite? This situation resembles Malthusian growth of the within-host parasite population, although Mathus was primarily concerned with the effects of human population growth on economies. But the basic idea is that a population grows unchecked until limited by availability of resources, and the growth can lead to catastrophe for the population if the host dies due to anemia. (However, if a mosquito has picked up some of the gametocytes, the catastrophe is not for the  Plasmodium  species itself. The within-host population is sacrificed.) The 1798 essay of Malthus had a great impact on biologists in the 19th century and is considered one of the founding works in population biology (Malthus  2003 ). In some ways, the models that I describe are akin to the logistics equation introduced by Malthus’s younger contemporary P.F. Verhulst to account for population growth limited by a resource (Hoppensteadt  1982 ). Before introducing the models, I must introduce two important concepts. Concept I: basic reproduction rate The lifetime  τ 
 μ  of a free merozoite is ≈10 min (Johnson et al.  1980 ), much shorter than the development time of the parasite within RBCs (≈2 days for both  P. vivax  and  P. falciparum ). The difference between these time scales allows us to derive, by statistical arguments, the average number of descendants an infected RBC has after one development cycle,  R , early in the infection before an immune response can respond (or if there is no immune response). Assuming that all vulnerable RBCs are equally likely to be invaded, we introduce a merozoite-RBC binding affinity ζ, so that the rate of infection of RBCs per unit volume of blood,  Inf 
 r , is

Making an additional assumption that early in the infection  V  changes slowly during one cycle of the within-RBC parasite, we obtain

				\begin{document}$$ R = \frac{{p{\tau_\mu }\zeta V}}{{1 + {\tau_\mu }\zeta V}} $$\end{document} 
 Here  p  is the average number of merozoites released from an infected RBC. [The details of the derivation are given in McQueen and McKenzie ( 2004 )]. Direct photographic evidence of bursting infected RBCs suggests that  p  ≈ 16 (Glushakova et al.  2005 ). As already mention in the section “ A conundrum of malaria biology ” above,  R  for both species at the beginning of infection is ≈15. Thus, the asexual forms of both species are very effective at propagating themselves before host immune reactions can intervene, with a characteristic time to invade an RBC ζ V  ≈ 24  s. I call the initial value of  R  the basic reproductive rate,  R 
 0 . Given  V ,  τ 
 μ , and  p , knowing  R 
 0  determines ζ. As infection progresses,  R  declines from  R 
 0  because (1) the vulnerable RBC population is depleted and (2) the host mounts an immune response against the parasite. Concept II: populations consist of aging individuals To develop a reasonable mathematical model, one has to treat the various constituents of the pathogen-host system (the erythocytes, the parasite, etc.) as populations of aging individuals: that is, on a population average, individuals spend  D  amount of time in a given stage of development with some standard deviation  σ . If simple rate equations were used to model the population levels of the constituents, then population level changes would be like that of radioactive nuclei decaying at random. Yet the development time of an individual parasite within an RBC is 48 h for the two species, with maybe a few hours of variation. Reticulocytes last only 36 h, plus or minus a few hours. Individuals in such populations are not like radioactive nuclei that randomly “pop” with probability per unit time of  D 
 −1 . To account realistically for aging, we used the technique of compartment ordinary differential equations in which a stage of development of an organism (with duration  D ) is described as a set of  N  substages with duration  DN 
 −1  that decay into one another. Letting  P 
 n  be the population in substage  n  (and ignoring interactions between individuals for a moment):

 I stress that  D ,  σ , and the total population Σ P 
 n  are the tangible quantities connected to measurement, not  N . The  N  substage populations are just a fictional construct. This technique was developed in the 1960s for population modeling, with Lloyd adapting it to epidemiology and within-host pathogen population dynamics (Lloyd  2001a ,  b ). [See also supplementary material in McQueen and McKenzie ( 2004 ).] We wrote a set of modular code libraries in Java (now in C++) that allowed for rapid modification of the numerical model as needed. It was found that a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with adaptive time stepping (Cash and Karp  1990 ) worked very well to solve the ordinary differential equation system arising from the application of Eqs.  3  and  4 , even though such systems might contain hundreds of dependent variables. The erythocyte-limited model This model was first described in McQueen and McKenzie ( 2004 ); it can thought as two developmental chains, one for RBCs and the other for the parasite. The stages of each chain are indicated in Fig.  2 . For each such stage, a system of differential equations similar to Eq.  3  describes the population changes; the corresponding values of  D  and  σ  are also shown in Fig.  2 . The two chains interact through the binding of merozoites to the vulnerable RBCs, as described in Eq.  1 . For convenience of the reader, the full system of differential equations that describe this model is given in the  Electronic supplementary material  (ESM).
 Fig. 2 The development chains assumed for normal and infected RBCs.  Plasmodium malariae  attacks human senescent RBCs; see the section “ Plasmodium vivax  is an insidious pathogen ” concerning this parasite 
 The simulation is started with a small number of merozoites to mimic the primary release of merozoites from the liver. The normal basal production rate for human RBCs is about 1,736 μl −1  h −1 ; we considered models in which this rate could be amplified to compensate for the RBC loss due to infection. We also considered models with dyserythropoiesis, a decline in the rate of production due to factors of the parasite. [For a review of observed effects of malaria upon erythropoiesis, see Wickramasinghe and Abdalla ( 2000 ).] For some sets of simulations, we varied the  σ  for the erythrocytic stage of the parasite to test the effects of changes in this model parameter upon the results. This will be discussed more in the section “ Sensitivity to the standard deviation of the life cycletime of the intraerythrocyte parasite .” Plasmodium vivax  is an insidious pathogen The erythrocyte-limited model of parasite dynamics predicts that even for a basic reproduction rate  R 
 0  ≤ 2,  P. vivax  infection would eventually deplete the reticulocyte pool enough to kill the patient: there would not be enough replacements for aged RBCs removed by the spleen (McQueen and McKenzie  2004 ). Figure  3  shows some typical simulation results. [The results in the figure are slightly different from those presented in McQueen and McKenzie ( 2004 ) because (1)  σ  of the infected RBC stage is 2.4 h instead of 4.8 h as in that paper, and (2) the level of lethal anemia was set lower than in that paper.] One effect apparent in Fig.  3  is that a compensatory response of RBC production would make matters worse for the host with  P. vivax  infection by lowering the value of  R 
 0  at which death via severe anemia could occur, as well as increasing the overall parasitemia. Conversely, dyserythropoiesis would tend to lower the number of parasites produced in lethal infections. These latter effects would also occur in the resource-limited model of  P. falciparum  infection, but then there is less effect on the survival of the host (see Fig.  S1  in the ESM).
 Fig. 3 a  Time of death for simulated  P. vivax  infection,  T D , assuming no immune constraints, as a function of basic reproduction rate  R 0 .  b  Corresponding total number of RBCs parasitized during the infection,  IBC INT . The  basal  results are for an erythocyte production rate at its basal value;  comp  results are for a production rate up to five times the basal value to compensate for blood loss due to infection; and  dys  results assume dyserythropoiesis: the production rate reduced by an amount equal to twice the rate of depletion of RBCs by infection. Infections were simulated for 5 years unless the RBC count dropped below 60% of the basal count, at which point the host was assumed to have died from anemia and the simulation was terminated. Each curve is the result of simulations at 1,000 random values for  R 0  chosen uniformly on the interval [1.01, 15.0]. Note: Log-log scale for both axes; horizontal axis is log ( R 0  − 1) in order to emphasize the differences between the curves 
 Since  R 
 0  ≈ 15 in actual infections, even in patients who survive the disease, human immune constraints on the growth of  P. vivax  must be very tight indeed! Even though the erythropoietic function affects some of the details of the erythrocyte-limited model infection outcome, infection with  P. vivax  in this model would be lethal even if  R 
 0  were just above 1 regardless of the erythropoietic function. The importance of the age-structured nature of the attack of  P. vivax  becomes apparent when examining Fig.  4 , which shows results for simulations using parameters for the pathogen  Plasmodium malariae , an attacker of senescent human RBCs. [The duration of the infected RBC stage for this pathogen is 72 h instead of 48 h. See McKenzie et al. ( 2001 ) for a review of knowledge about this parasite.] No simulated  P. malariae  infection ended in host death unless there was dyserythropoiesis, even though  P. malariae  attacks a slightly larger subset of RBCs in this model. Since no other stage of RBC development depends on the senescent cells, depletion of this population would not cause severe anemia unless a secondary effect disrupted the production of RBCs or killed uninfected RBCs.
 Fig. 4 Panels  a  and  b  are the same as in Fig.  3 , except that the model pathogen is  P. malariae ; see the section “ Plasmodium vivax  is an insidious pathogen ” for details. Curves are the same erythropoietic responses as in Fig.  3 . Note for  a : only simulation with dyserythropoiesis ended with death of the host 
 If both  P. vivax  and  P. falciparum  infect the host in an erythrocyte-limited model, the results depend on which infects first, and their respective values of  R 
 0 . Basically, we found that the species with the largest value of  R 
 0  dominates. See McQueen and McKenzie ( 2006 ) for more detailed discussion. Adding host immunity In real malaria infections, hosts mount aggressive immune responses, both innate and adaptive. For example, the report of Karunaweera et al. ( 1992 ) illustrates the quick production (and then decay) of cytokines associated with innate responses in patients infected by  P. vivax . [Some good reviews of immune responses to malaria are Engwerda and Good ( 2005 ), Karunaweera et al. ( 2003 ), and Plebanski and Hill ( 2000 ).] To address how the presence of immune responses might affect the virulence of  Plasmodium  spp., we added additional components to the model to incorporate two types of immune reactions: (1) a fast acting, fast decaying response to mimic the intense innate reactions seen in malarias, and (2) a slowly activating, slowly decaying response to mimic an antibody response. Since some of the innate immune reaction is believed to be triggered by the bursting of the schizonts, the model innate response is triggered when the level of late-stage-infected RBCs is above a threshold (that varies from simulation to simulation). Then a factor is produced that attacks some subset of the parasite; the rate of removal of parasites,  C , would be

 Here,  Att 
 Inn  is the attacker level in the blood for the model innate reaction,  ξ 
 Inn  is the binding affinity of the attacker to the targeted parasites, and  P  is the subset of parasite population that is attacked. (For example, it could be only infected RBCs that are trophozoites. In another simulation it might be only schizonts.) In a sense, it is the product  ξ 
 Inn 
 Att 
 Inn  that is the tangible quantity, as it is a rate of removal. The model antibody response is similar, except that a delay is incorporated before the level of the attacker factor grows; a formalism similar to that of Eq.  3  above enforces the delay. The dynamics of both types of immune responses are modeled with a system of differential equations; for details see McQueen and McKenzie ( 2008 ). Also, the immune components of the model are expounded in the  ESM . The targets, trigger levels, and binding affinities of both types of responses were varied so that simulations were performed for thousands of points in the parameter space of the models. (In addition, we consider several values of  σ  for the infected erythrocyte stage; see the section “ Sensitivity to the standard deviation of the life cycletime of the intraerythrocyte parasite ” below.) The main conclusion is that given an immune response with the same capacity to detect and clear parasites,  P. vivax  infection would be just as severe in terms of risk of lethal outcome as  P. falciparum . This can be seen in Fig.  5 , which shows the results of simulations with basic reproduction rate  R 
 0  = 15 but with immune responses present. In most of the phase space of the model immune parameters, the immune responses protect the host from death by severe anemia. A compensatory increase in the rate of erythropoiesis to blood cell loss due to infection tends to boost overall parasitemia, especially for  P .  vivax , although the fraction of phase space in which the host dies is about same as for the case when the erythropoiesis is fixed at the basal rate. On the other hand, dyserythropoiesis tends to reduce on average the burden of parasitemia to which the host can mount an immune response, but increases the fraction of phase space that is lethal to the host, especially for  P. vivax . One wonders if the dyserythropoiesis observed in some patients has been shaped by an evolutionary struggle between humans and  Plasmodium  spp.

The fraction is of 9,520 simulations: 2,380 combinations of immune response parameters, each with four values of  σ  for the duration of the infected RBC stage.  b  The number of parasites produced during infection,  IBC INT , averaged over all points in parameter space for those four types of erythropoietic responses.  c  Symbols used for the two  Plasmodium  spp. Abbreviations:  Comp  production rate can go up to five times the basal rate to compensate for RBC loss,  Basal  erythrocyte production rate held at basal rate,  MDys  moderate dyserythropoiesis: production rate declines by 4.5× rate of loss of cells due to infection,  SDys  severe dyserythropoiesis: production rate declines up to 8.5× rate of cell loss due to infection. Host was assumed to die if the RBC count dropped to under 60% of the basal count 
 Since even models with plausible immune responses predict that  P. vivax  can cause infections as severe as those of  P .  falciparum , why does the latter species cause more severe disease on average than the former, especially in people who have no previous exposure to either pathogen? One possible answer is that actual human immune responses to  P. vivax  are in a part of the immune system phase space in which infections are controlled more readily, either by being detected at a lower threshold than  P. falciparum  or by more efficient processes of removal of  P. vivax -infected cells. Furthermore, immune responses are immensely complex, and perhaps some important component has been left out. For example, we did not consider the effects of antigenic variation in  P. falciparum  infection, in which the parasite modifies over time some of its proteins exposed to the immune system (Hommel et al.  1983 ). And RBCs infected with  P .  falciparum  can sequester from the blood by adhering to vascular endothelium (Udomsangpetch et al.  2002 ), which perhaps gives that species an extra ability to evade immune attack. Although both species produce factors to suppress host responses (Kubata et al.  1998 ; del Portillo et al.  2004 ), perhaps  P. falciparum  can achieve suppression more readily. Yet there is another possibility: maybe severe  P. vivax  infection is more common than thought. News from the clinic: severe vivax malaria As we were doing our theoretical work on the population dynamics of  P. vivax , empirical evidence mounted that this pathogen can cause severe disease after all. In Korea, vivax malaria was associated with retinal hemorrhaging (Choi et al.  2004 ) and splenic infarction (Kim et al.  2007 ). Kochar et al. ( 2005 ) reported 11 patients with severe malaria (renal and cerebral complications, severe anemia, fatal outcomes) from northwestern India in which polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of parasite DNA as well as pathology examination showed  P. vivax  present, but not  P. falciparum  [see also Kochar et al. ( 2007 )]. A follow-up report from that region (Kochar et al.  2009 ) showed that out of ≈1,100 patients admitted to a hospital in Bikaner for malaria, 40 of them had severe malaria in which PCR analysis could only find  P. vivax  and not  P. falciparum . If further investigation can confirm this work, then  P. vivax  is a more severe public health problem than realized. The question is not academic, as the drug regime for  P. vivax  disease is somewhat different from that for  P. falciparum  disease. There are other questions, too, that need investigating: (1) Has severe vivax malaria always been present but cryptic, or are the cases seen in India and Korea due to the emergence of new strains? (2) Do patients with severe vivax malaria have some other health problem that exacerbates the disease? Only further research will show. Empirical observation is what ultimately defines the truth of the matter, but the construction of a plausible mathematical model of malaria infection can help us understand why  P .  vivax  can cause severe or even lethal disease. Of course, not all the pathology is due to anemia, as it is in the models discussed in this review. Some disease symptoms will be due to self-damage by the host immune responses, and perhaps by toxins released by the parasite (Elsheikha and Sheashaa  2007 ). Nonetheless, the modeling shows that there is no a priori reason for  P. vivax  to be harmless just because it attacks only a small subset of RBCs, the reticulocytes. The fact that all RBCs must pass through the reticulocyte stage means that  P. vivax  has the capability to do immense harm, especially if it can interfere with erythropoiesis in the bone marrow. Many of the vivax malaria patients described by Kochar et al. ( 2009 ) had severe anemia, a result understandable from our models. Sensitivity to the standard deviation of the life cycle time of the intraerythrocyte parasite In addition to elucidating how severe anemia can come about, mathematical modeling can help frame other questions concerning basic malaria biology. One interesting phenomenon in human malaria is the synchronization of merozoite release from bursting infected RBCs. Various mechanisms have been proposed for this: (1) different effects of fever during the earlier and late parts of the erythrocytic stage (Kwiatkowski  1995 ), (2) modulation of the life cycle of the parasite by immune responses (Hoshen et al.  2000 ; Rouzine and McKenzie  2003 ), and (3) modulation by the melatonin cycle of the host (Hotta et al.  2000 ). We found in our simulation that a quickly acting, quickly decaying innate response would induce synchronized release of merozoites as illustrated in Fig.  6 ; otherwise, bursting of individual parasitized cells becomes out of phase (McQueen and McKenzie  2008 ). One question we investigated was the sensitivity of simulation results to the standard deviation in the time that parasites spend within RBCs,  σ 
 IBC . The value of this quantity by itself does not determine if synchronization occurs, but it does effect the duration of merozoite release from the synchronized bursting of schizonts. In particular, we wanted to know if short duration of release would enhance the parasite levels by allowing an evasion of immune pressures.
 Fig. 6 An example of a time series of the density of merozoites,  μ , from a simulated  P. vivax  infection. These data are from the same simulation used to illustrate the gray curves in Fig. 1, panels A–D, in McQueen and McKenzie ( 2008 ). Both a quickly acting, quickly decaying model innate response and a slowly acting, slowing decaying antibody response are present. Time = 0 marks the beginning of infection 
 Simulation results indicate that a small value of  σ 
 IBC  (“tight” synchronization) might not necessarily benefit the parasite; in fact, as is apparent in Fig.  7 , it might actually suppress overall parasitemia. Furthermore, the fraction of the model parameter space in which the host dies of anemia is smaller as the standard deviation in the within-host duration decreases, especially for  P. vivax  infection. From a purely dynamical point of view, a tight synchronization of merozoite release might well benefit the host, not the parasite. However, one effect not included is the possible release of a factor that might suppress immune responses: a quick, overwhelming release of such a factor could boost parasitemia. Another issue is that for the propagation of the parasite genome, it is the survival of the gametocytes and their ability to be taken up by mosquitoes that is important, and we do not know what bearing tight synchronization has on that process. Both of these issues merit further empirical and theoretical investigation.

The fraction is of 9,520 simulations: 2,380 combinations of immune response parameters, each with the four types of erythropoietic responses as given in the legend of Fig.  5 .  b  Number of parasites produced during infection,  IBC INT , averaged over all points in parameter space for those four values of  σ .  Squares P. falciparum  ,  circles  P. vivax . Host death was assumed if the RBC count dropped to under 60% of the basal count 
 Some further directions The production of gametocytes is an area of active research, as much remains to be discovered. For example, are gametocytes produced at a constant rate throughout infection or is their production triggered by some stressor on the within-host parasite population (Carter and Miller  1979 )? Indeed, Diebner et al. ( 2000 ) used mathematical modeling results to argue that the rate of gametocyte production is highly variable during  P. falciparum  infection and is modulated by host innate immunity. Furthermore, the actual transition steps from asexual forms to gametocytes are still not known, although careful gene expression analysis is giving us a clearer answer (Eksi et al.  2008 ). Can modeling help with the understanding of that process? The development of gametocytes differs between  P. vivax  and  P. falciparum  (McKenzie et al.  2007 ); what are the implications of that for their population dynamics (and perhaps on their transmissibility to mosquitoes)? Further modeling could well prove fruitful in understanding the genesis and development of gametocytes. Finally, in the discussions above, I used severe anemia as a proxy for severity of infection in the hypothetical patient. But one could easily use additional criteria to define an infection in which the host is at major risk of dying or suffering long term disability. For example, the level of cytokines in a model immune response could be used as a proxy for possible cerebral damage. One could also consider a build-up of toxins from the parasite as well. “What-if” questions could be used to elucidate the consequences of plausible processes that may damage the host in cases of malaria.

    <Abstact>My career in science started with my PhD under Professor Darcy Gilmour at the University of Sydney. I quickly learned his iconoclastic ways and completed the degree in early 1969 in just over three years. Professor Charles Birch was the Head of Zoology and had been watching my progress and offered me a position as Lecturer as soon as my PhD was submitted. He asked me to set up a new course on invertebrate physiology, and the salary enabled me to afford the airfare to San Francisco for my family. In December 1969, I headed to the University of California San Francisco to work with Manuel Morales in the renowned Cardiovascular Research Institute headed by Julius Comroe (1965), the author of the textbook of pulmonary physiology, The Lung. I had a great time there meeting many important scientists that I had only read about, including Setsuro Ebashi, Andrew Huxley, Fumio Oosawa and Bernard Katz who had just won his Nobel Prize. It was inspiring. For the next two and a half years, I immersed myself in fluorescence polarisation spectroscopy, and rubbed up against with some of the best minds in the muscle field including Roger Cooke. Manuel Morales sent Roger to collect this Aussie and his family, and we have remained friends ever since.</Abstact>
    <Body>The Louis N Katz prize In 1971, I had the good fortune to be awarded the Louis N Katz Prize of the American Heart Association for Young Investigators for my first big manuscript (dos Remedios et al.  1972 ). Later, this manuscript was selected by the Editors of  Journal of Muscle Research and Cell Motility  inclusion in the list of 50 outstanding contributions to muscle research since the publications by AF Huxley and J Niedergerke and by HE Huxley and J Hanson in  Nature  in 1954. The news of this prize quickly spread back to Sydney, and in 1972 I was offered a Senior Lectureship in human anatomy at the University of New South Wales which I gratefully accepted. But then two years later, the head of the Department Professor Michael Blunt moved to the University of Sydney and invited me to follow him. The Muscle Research Unit In 1974, I established the Muscle Research Unit at the University of Sydney. I focused on the structure and function of the muscle protein actin. This ubiquitous protein is expressed in significant quantities (10% of total protein) in all cells and represents about 30% of the total contractile proteins in muscle. This research was initially funded (1975) by the National Heart Foundation and the ARC, but soon I had several concurrent project grants funded by the NHMRC that continued for three decades. I published the first images of actin monomer using two-dimensional crystals of actin (dos Remedios and Dickens,  1978 ), and over the next 20 years I published over 60 papers on actin and actin-binding proteins. Much of my focus was using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) spectroscopy to map intramolecular and intermolecular distances of actin of myosin. Sceptics of FRET believed that assuming the value of kappa ( k 2 ) to be 2/3 relied on the assumption that both donor and acceptor probes could freely precess. They argued that covalently binding these probes to surface amino acids would restrict probe movements; therefore,  k 2  was “unknown”. In 1995, we (dos Remedios and Pierre Moens) put that argument to rest, not only by citing scores of papers where  k 2  worked, but also by citing who demonstrated rotational freedom of peptide side chains (dos Remedios and Moens  1995 ). I also edited four books which arose from International Conferences I arranged devoted to advances in actin and actin-binding proteins. The last book (dos Remedios and Chhabra  2007 ) had 12,469 chapter downloads by 2017. However, my fascination with actin dwindled once the actin-DNaseI complex was crystallised; the atomic structure of actin was determined by Kabsch et al. in  1990 . Dr Victor Chang In 1989 following a chance meeting, I began working with Dr Victor Chang, famous for his role in the development of human heart transplantation in Australia for which he was awarded the nation’s highest honour Companion of the Order of Australia in 1986, and in 2000 he was named Australian of the Century. Although we worked together for only two years before he was murdered, Victor changed the course of my life from a protein chemist to a 30-year research program with the aim of trying to understand the molecular basis for human heart failure. Tragically, Victor was murdered on July 4, 1991. By then, my students and I had gotten used to getting up in the small hours of the morning to collect the hearts at St Vincent’s Transplant Theaters. Also, I was travelling a lot in the US, UK, Japan and Europe developing close contacts with the muscle biophysics community through the Gordon Research conferences. My approach was simple. I believed that no one person could hope to get to the bottom of all forms of human heart failure, but as a community we could certainly make good progress. Sydney Heart Bank Today, the Sydney Heart Bank contains explanted hearts from over 350 patients. I am not overstating when I say the quality of the tissue from these patients was exceptional. All heart samples were snap-frozen in the theatres of the St Vincent’s Hospital in liquid nitrogen. All parts of the heart were collected within 40 minutes of the “cross-clamp” when the heart loses its supply of arterial blood. Initially, we collected only a few samples from each of the four chambers of the heart, but soon we realised that other researchers also needed tissue, particularly from the left ventricles. Victor Chang was very encouraging but real progress was inhibited by the paucity of healthy donor hearts with which we could compare with the failing hearts. Healthy non-failing hearts were primarily used as donors in the Heart &amp; Lung Transplant Unit. However, every so often, a donor would become available with a tissue type that did not match any of the waiting patients. Gradually, we accumulated hearts that, for a variety of reasons, made them unsuitable as donors. Brain-dead donors often resulted from a motor vehicle accident (including motorcycles), but most arose from aneurisms or massive haemorrhages of the arteries that supply the brain. Others, particularly children, had drowned and been revived but with no brain wave activity. When there were no young patients waiting for a heart transplant, we collected the heart. Other donors sadly had taken their own lives. Over the decades, we have collected over 120 healthy donor hearts. None of these were post-mortem cases where tissue was not collected for 24 hours or more after death. Sydney Heart Bank Logistics Transportation of the heart samples around the world was achieved using nitrogen-vapour dewars. Airlines would not allow sufficient dry ice for a flight from Sydney to the West Coast of the USA. Our dewars could maintain – 190 °C for sufficient time to deliver samples from Sydney to researchers anywhere. When dewars returned to Sydney which sometimes created long delays, the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service (AQIS) even threatened to decontaminate dewars with liquid which would have destroyed a $2000 dewar. It took quite a lot of persistence to get access to the head of Australia’s AQIS and explain that our dewars were never used to transport animal tissue. That solved the problem. Collection, transportation and storage at temperatures completely prevented the degradation of sensitive biomolecules, such as RNA, and giant proteins like titin (the largest protein in the heart). Soon, reviewers of our manuscripts stopped assuming human tissue was degraded in any significant way. In fact, the tissue we collected in 1989 shows no sign of degradation in 2020. The collection process is really most efficient when two members of the team are involved. Usually, these were students working on various aspects of heart failure. I am grateful to Tom Yeoh, Toby Trahair (Trahair et al.  1990 ;  1993 ), Desiree Berry, Masako Tsubakihara, Sean Lal and Amy Li, to mention just a few, many of whom went on to do Medicine and a PhD. I could not have managed without their assistance. To date, we have collaboratively published 143 papers in high-quality journals. What have we discovered? The SHB has made many contributions to our understanding of the molecular basis of human heart failure. Here, I briefly outline three examples: There has been a long-running polemic over whether post-natal human cardiomyocytes can proliferate. We sent 36 samples to Bernhard Kühn’s group (Harvard) of healthy SHB donors aged between 3 months and 65 years (Mollova et al.  2013 ; Polizzotti et al.  2015 ). They developed a novel method of isolating cardiomyocytes using a preliminary fixation followed by collagenase digestion. This yielded over 92% of cardiomyocytes. Using microscopy, they found that cardiomyocyte proliferation and growth contribute to heart development. They measured a 3.4-fold increase in the number of cardiomyocytes which was consistent with predictions based on cell cycle activity during childhood and young adolescence, suggesting that with treatment during this period it may be possible to stimulate cardiac repair. The Sydney Heart Bank also contributed heart samples to the Jonas Frisén-Olaf Bergmann (Bergmann et al.  2015 ) laboratory in Stockholm, who took a very different approach to the question of proliferation. On April 26, 1986, the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in northern Ukraine effectively resulted in pulse-labelling ( 14 C) all people born after 1986. This was an extensive analysis of not only the left ventricle but of all chambers of the heart. We contributed samples from some of our younger donor hearts but over 50 human hearts were examined. They concluded that cardiomyocyte numbers do not appreciably change soon after birth and that changes in heart mass can be accounted for by hypertrophy remaining constant throughout the human lifespan, with a low turnover rate. Cardiac endothelial cell turnover was greater than 15% per year. Turnover of mesenchymal cells was also appreciable (&lt; 4% year in adults), but the exchange rate for cardiomyocyte is highest in babies and children and their numbers increase into adulthood to &lt; 1%. We will need new ideas and new techniques to determine which lab is correct. The second example deals with a different but equally fundamental question. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common familial disease, and more than one-third of these patients carry a mutation in myosin heavy chain 7 ( MYH7 ). While the severity of the phenotype depends on the location of the mutation in the MYH7 gene, it also depends on the fraction of mutated vs wild-type protein expressed. Theresia Kraft and her colleagues from the laboratory of the Late Bernard Brenner (Hannover) reported a surprising result. Using left ventricle samples from HCM patients, they measured contractile force in isolated single cardiomyocytes and found large cell-to-cell differences in Ca-induced contraction (Montag et al.  2018 ). They also characterised gene transcription by visualising active transcription of intronic and exonic sequences of  MYH7 -pre-mRNA (Montag et al.  2018 ). Some cardiomyocytes were essentially the same, as healthy donors suggested they expressed no mutated  MYH7  RNA. In total, 27% of myocyte nuclei were without active transcription sites and this was inconsistent with a continuous transcription mechanism. However, it was consistent with a burst-like transcription of mutant where wild-type alleles result in some myocytes having a completely wild-type expression, while adjacent cells had a completely hypertrophic phenotype (Montag et al.  2018 ). These reports ring “alarm bells” when attempting to phenotype from analyses of bulk heart tissue. My third example arose in a curious way. We had been collaborating with Michael Ackerman and Martijn Bos (Mayo Clinic) for nearly a decade but we puzzled over the meaning of the data, so we decided to not publish. Then, in February, when COVID-19 became hot news, they remembered that ACE2 was the single largest upregulated (×3.5) gene and was the most (×5) upregulated protein. The connection to COVID-19 and heart complications suddenly became clearer because ACE2 is the membrane receptor through which SARS-CoV-2 enters cardiomyocytes, thus conferring an increased risk of cardiac involvement in COVID-19. The paper (Bos et al.  2020 ) was quickly accepted, but it illustrates how good science is never wasted. </Body>

    <Title>Biophysics of human anatomy and physiology—a Special Issue in honor of Prof. Cristobal dos Remedios on the occasion of his 80th birthday</Title>
    <Doi>10.1007/s12551-020-00745-x</Doi>
    <Authors>Hall Damien, Li Amy, Cooke Roger</Authors>
    <Abstact>In 2001, Cristobal dos Remedios was made Professor of Anatomy (now emeritus) within Australia’s highest-ranked university (University of Sydney). For the majority of his career, he has examined the biomechanics and biophysics of human muscle contraction. To coincide with the occasion of his 80th birthday, this Special Issue has commissioned a collection of review articles from experts exploring biophysical subjects within the general areas of human anatomy and physiology. After introducing the scope and contents of the Issue, we provide a short scientific biography, placing his scientific achievements within the context of the course of his life’s developments.</Abstact>
    <Body>Cris dos Remedios has played an important role in the development of biophysical research both within Australia and worldwide. Passionate about research, he has pioneered a number of molecular biophysics methodologies for the investigation of muscle contraction (dos Remedios et al.  1972 ; dos Remedios and Moens  1995 ; dos Remedios and Chhabra  2007 ; Mollova et al.  2013 ; Montag et al.  2018 ). Within the cardiac muscle field, he is perhaps best known for establishing the Sydney heart bank—a community-wide resource that consists of a very large sample repository of healthy and diseased patient’s hearts that have a full associated medical workup and case history (dos Remedios et al.  2017 ). This Special Issue is split into two general sections. The first includes a series of Commentaries and Letters that allow the authors to describe their scientific and personal interaction with Cris through the course of his career (Table  1 ). Contributions have been received from both present and former collaborators as well as students at different stages of their professional and academic progression. The second section involves a collection of scientific review articles associated with Cris’s principal research topic, the molecular basis of heart muscle contraction. These review articles include analysis of areas ranging from the molecular, to the tissue level, of study (Table  2 ). To set the scene and help place these articles in context, this Editorial provides a short history of Prof. dos Remedios's life and research in roughly chronological order 1 . Following this Editorial is a personal recollection by Cris reflecting on his life in research (dos Remedios  2020 ). Immediately after this is the fourth addition to our Biophysical Reviews ‘Meet the Editor Series’ featuring Assoc. Prof. Joshua Ho (University of Hong Kong) - one of the five Executive Editors (Ho  2020 ).

( 2020 ) An interesting family history As science is an international endeavour, it is relatively common to meet people from different countries and cultures. With this said, it would be fair to say that Cris has one of the more exotic cultural pedigrees likely to be encountered. The dos Remedios surname is in fact Portuguese and was inherited from his paternal grandfather Carlos dos Remedios. Carlos was a Portuguese national who traded between the Spanish port of Barcelona and the major Japanese port of Kobe in the late 1800s (soon after Japan opened to the outside world). Honoured by the Spanish government for his efforts in expanding this trade route, Carlos was granted a minor title and Spanish citizenship. At the turn of the century, he married a Chilean woman who sadly died in childbirth, but years later he met and married a Japanese woman, Kimura-san, in Kobe. At that time, marrying a non-Japanese person meant that Kimura-san had her Japanese citizenship withdrawn and literally became a stateless person under Japanese law. The marriage meant she became Spanish but without any citizenship or passport; she was unable to leave Japan (this situation persisted well into the latter part of the twentieth century). Happily, the union produced two children, Maria Franco (nee dos Remedios) and Carlos Guillermo dos Remedios, the latter being Cris’s father. The family settled in Yokohama where they lived in relative comfort with their children growing up in the rapidly changing environment of Japan in the first half of the twentieth century 2 . Carlos entered the family trading business and eventually met and fell in love with Joyce Lillian Taylor, the daughter of an English Professor of Economic History in Tokyo. Carlos and Joyce were married in 1937 just a few years before Japan entered World War II. The outbreak of war and the polarization of society that accompanied it was not kind to Cris’s parents in their pursuit of a happy married life. Identifying as a Japanese, Cris’s father felt obliged to remain in Japan to look after his American friends who were interned there. Carlos’ Spanish citizenship meant he was free to remain in Japan but due to her English citizenship, Joyce was deemed persona non grata and given a limited time to leave the country. This she did together with her eight-month-old son Cris, her younger sister Brenda, and her Mother Mary and Father Ronald (REM Cameron) on the steamship ‘ The Ruys ’, one of the last commercial vessels departing from Japan for Sydney, Australia. Arriving with her newly born son in an unfamiliar country in 1940, Joyce set about starting a new life, as the Second World War in the pacific began in earnest. Early schooling Life was not easy for Joyce as a young single mother in Sydney. Taking a job as a teacher, she raised Cris whilst Australia was mobilizing to fight alongside Britain in Europe and the USA in the Asia Pacific region. Despite being separated from her husband and considering the marriage to be non-repairable, she had nevertheless promised Carlos that Cris would be raised as a catholic (despite herself identifying as a member of the Church of England). With limited funds and location requirements, this meant that Cris’s earliest schooling was carried out at St. Vincent’s catholic girl’s school with Cris enrolling as the school’s only boy pupil. As he got older, he transferred to Campion Hall—a slightly further afield Jesuit primary school that was, to his great delight, solely for boys. Inevitably however his Japanese heritage leaked to his classmates and the children, with child-like reasoning, sought to extract some rough justice for what they perceived as his shared responsibility for the recent war in the pacific. During the interview process for the preparation of this Editorial, Cris was asked what he did to curtail the beatings suffered on the playground. In what may be a particularly insightful answer, Cris remarked that he set about forming his own gang that were, on the whole, collectively tougher than his playground detractors—after which bullying became increasingly less of a problem! This primary school ‘gang’ became a close-knit and highly loyal group of friends that he kept throughout junior and senior high school. Along with this group, Cris entered Marist Brothers North Shore Jesuit High School and it was here that he received an excellent introduction to the sciences 3  which helped to propel him into Australia’s top university, the University of Sydney. A peripatetic academic beginning After finishing high school, Cris signed up to perform mandatory national army service. However, upon turning eighteen, Australian law mandated that he take the citizenship of his father—so Cris found himself a Spanish citizen once again. Before entering national service, he was required to become a naturalized citizen 4 . In a somewhat anticlimactic fashion after becoming naturalized, the army service requirement was cancelled allowing Cris a straight path to university. Cris was admitted to study medicine; however, after completing three years of a six-year course, he realized that he was not naturally suited to caring for the sick. Upon attending a lecture by John Eccles 5  on neurophysiology, Cris made the decision to change his enrolment to science which, with prior credit, he obtained in two years. Upon suggestion from his undergraduate mentor, the noted geneticist and population ecologist Prof. Charles Birch, Cris was encouraged to enrol in an Honours Degree in Physiology. Upon graduating with a first-class degree, he then undertook a PhD course supervised by Prof. Darcy Gilmour on the topic of the filament structure of muscle (Fig.  1 ). Cris describes Gilmour as an iconoclastic intellectual and in this spirit, he set Cris the ambitious project of determining the microscopic filament structure of skeletal muscle isolated from the common mud crab using an electron microscope (EM). Fig. 1 Mentors and some friends and colleagues from six decades of research. PhD supervisor Prof. Darcy Gilmour University of Sydney ( top left ). Postdoctoral supervisor Prof. Manuel Morales in Germany in 1981 ( top right ).

Taking a break whilst starting the muscle research unit at the University of Sydney in 1976 ( mid right ). Cris with some of the postdoctoral fellows of the Morales laboratory in 1971 ( bottom ) (photos from personal collection of Cristobal dos Remedios) As Cris recalls the story, his first challenge was to get time on the electron microscope of which the department had two—a low-resolution Siemens Elmiskop 1A and a higher-resolution Phillips 200. In what would be a recognizable situation to many experimentalists, the facility manager fiercely guarded the two machines, making it hard for a novice to gain familiarity with the equipment and the much needed time to investigate freely. To overcome this problem, Cris enrolled the help of the microscope engineer Bob Wright, who Cris persuaded to train him in the usage of the EM from 6 pm, after the facility manager had departed for the day. Proceeding in this way (working the night shift), he became experimentally adept in operating both devices, mastering sample preparation, microscope setup and alignment, image capture, and (at times) emergency repairs running to an 8-am deadline! When Cris reached a resolution limit due to the staining protocol he was using, he independently reached out to Edgar Mercer, an electron microscopy expert located at the Australian National University. Travelling on his own initiative to Canberra for a few weeks, Cris received instruction on a superior single myofilament sample preparation and staining protocol based on the use of ammonium molybdate. Cris’s remarkably well resolved longitudinal and transverse EM images suggested that, in addition to the thick (myosin) and thin (actin) filaments, a third unknown filament may be present within the basic myofibril structural unit 6 . To further investigate his ‘residual filament hypothesis’, Cris sought time on a higher energy laboratory-built electron microscope housed within the department of physics. With his somewhat clandestine night-time usage of the high-resolution EM, his improved staining protocol and his borrowed time on an experimental device in a different department, Cris was able to finish his PhD thesis in three years (dos Remedios  1965 ). This was considerably less time than what was considered standard within the Department of Physiology at that time. On recalling his PhD experience, Cris credits both Gilmour and Birch for instilling in him a sense of the need to carefully formulate his own hypotheses and solve these problems in an independent fashion 7 . Starting both a family and an academic career During his PhD studies, Cris met Trish Harrison, who would go on to play the most significant role in his life—as his future wife and mother of his four children. A daughter of a renowned local family 8 , Trish worked for the Sydney branch of Vogue magazine. She met Cris at a party whilst he was still attending medical school and the two soon started courting. Cris recalls having to apply all his charm to overcome his future in-laws’ sense of trepidation about having a ‘foreigner’ dating their daughter. However, things progressed and the young couple married in 1964, with their first son Nick born in Australia during Cris’s PhD write-up period in 1967. Cris and Trish went on to have three more sons, Dominic (born 1971), Benedict (born 1978) and Oliver (born 1982). Towards the end of his PhD, Cris applied to the American Heart Foundation for a postdoctoral fellowship to be carried out in Prof. Manuel Morales laboratory at the University of California San Francisco. Although successful in obtaining the fellowship, the award came without travel support. Fortunately for Cris, he was offered a junior lectureship in anatomy at the University of Sydney by the head of his department (and former mentor) Prof. Charles Birch. This allowed him to save sufficient money to cover the relocation of his new family to the west coast of America. Even at that time, the cost of rent in San Francisco was not commensurate with a scientists’ salary and Cris recalls having to spend 70% of his fellowship monies on a small one-bedroom apartment. Despite Prof. Morales having a reputation as an authoritarian, Cris both enjoyed working with him and the scientific life in the group. Equipped with the latest equipment, the laboratory was staffed by postdoctoral fellows only. With no students to assist the young postdoctoral cohort could really concentrate on serious research. Cris continued his research topic of myofibril structural analysis but employed new techniques based on electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) (Barden et al.  1980 ) and various forms of fluorescence microscopy that included fluorescence photobleaching methods and fluorescence polarization techniques (dos Remedios et al.  1972 ; Botts et al.  1973 ). During his postdoctoral fellowship, Cris formed many close friendships with other postdoctoral and visiting scientists, with many of these contributing to the current Issue. Of particular scientific note during this time was Cris’s research into: (I) Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence studies of actomyosin function. Cris noted that a single tryptophan existed in the ‘head’ region and that this lone intrinsic fluorescent label could be used for localized structure function experiments (dos Remedios et al.  1972 ). (II) FRET studies of actomyosin contraction that helped to provide some of the earliest precise distance information between actin and myosin proteins (dos Remedios and Cooke,  1984 ; dos Remedios and Moens  1995 ). An interesting story recalled by Cris about his stay in the Morales laboratory was his refusal, on one occasion, to include an additional author on a scientific paper that was being jointly written with the laboratory chief Morales. Cris’s feeling was that the scientist in question had not made a significant contribution. This put Cris in direct conflict with Prof. Morales—a seemingly untenable position. However, instead of giving up, Cris organized a discussion over dinner where he made his case calmly and without rancour, after which Morales relented. As many realize, such determination to take a stand on principal is not always advantageous to a scientist’s career advancement; however, in this case, it served Cris well and the interaction led to a greater personal respect for him from Morales. Return to Australia Notably, Cris’s work on the use of intrinsic fluorescence for the study of actomyosin function led to him receiving the Louis N Katz Prize for young researchers from the American Heart Association. Partly due to the notoriety associated with the winning of this award, Cris was approached by a senior colleague of Morales working in the Mayo Clinic at the University of Minnesota and offered a tenure track position. At roughly the same time, he received a telegram offering him a lectureship in anatomy, at the University of New South Wales. After a discussion with his wife, Cris realized that it was time to return home but managed to use the Minnesota offer to negotiate for an upgrade to a Senior Lectureship position at UNSW. Returning in 1972, he received both Australian Research Council and National Health and Medical Research Council grants to support his Australian return to a position involving a mixture of teaching and research. After two years at UNSW, Cris was offered a senior lectureship at his alma mater, the University of Sydney, which he took in 1974. Cris remained at the University of Sydney from 1974 till his formal retirement in 2015 (after which he maintained his laboratory as an Emeritus Professor through to 2019). Progressing through the ranks from Senior Lecturer to Associate Professor (1986) and then Full Professor (2000), Cris trained a bevy of students along the way, with many contributing to this Special Issue. A popular lecturer, the dos Remedios seminars on comparative anatomy were notable for often containing practical dissections of the kind made famous in the early history of medicine. On the research front, Cris continued with his research on the molecular mechanisms of human heart failure (Bao et al.  1990 ; dos Remedios and Moens  1995 ; Berry et al.  1999 ; Dunn et al.  2003 ; Ho et al.  2008 ; Li et al.  2012 ; Hamdani et al.  2013 ; Mollova et al.  2013 ; McNamara et al.  2017 ). However, despite having access to human hearts donated for research, Cris noted that many studies (including his own) suffered a major deficiency, in that the number of age- and sex-matched controls was severely limited and the sample storage post mortem was often not optimal. To combat this problem, Cris, together with one of Australia’s most famous heart surgeons Dr. Victor Chang, personally attended human transplants and end of life surgeries to receive and properly store hearts as well as providing systematic documentation of patient histories. What started as a personal effort to improve data quality would go on to become the Sydney Heart Bank—an important resource for heart researchers throughout the world (dos Remedios et al.  2017 ). Another notable feature of Cris’s research career in Australia was his ability to reconnect to his Japanese routes. Forming close collaborations with a number of Japanese scientists, Cris became a frequent visitor to Japan. Amongst many notable collaborations, we point out Cris’s close involvement with Prof. Fumio Oosawa of Nagoya University—a giant of the actin research field. IUPAB and  Biophysical Reviews In interacting with Cris, one often hears his critical assessment of a less than capable colleague as ‘a do nothing kind of person’. This comment goes a long way to describing some of Cris’s philosophy on work and science. A strong believer in the concept of scientific service, Cris has always attempted to put personal effort into the collective scientific enterprise. Part of this mentality can be recognized in Cris’s activities as Director of the Bosch Institute at the University of Sydney, as a council member (2004–2008) and then Secretary-General (2008–2014) to the International Union of Pure and Applied Biophysics (IUPAB) (Fig.  2 ) and in his service to the  Biophysical Reviews  journal of which he was chief editor from 2014 to 2018 (dos Remedios  2019 ). In all these associations, Cris has been an energetic advocate and genuine force for good—oftentimes propelling the structures forward through a combination of his enthusiasm and unselfish efforts, along the way creating robust structures, able to benefit the many and not just the few.

Cris as Editor in Chief of  Biophysical Reviews  handing out journal material at the US Biophysical Society Meeting in 2009 together with Springer representative Dr. Sabine Schwarz ( bottom ) (photos from personal collection of Cristobal dos Remedios) ‘Winding down’ Cris dos Remedios style Having fully retired from active teaching and supervision roles at the University of Sydney, Cris (at the age of 80) has recently accepted a Guest Professorship at the research-focussed Victor Chang Heart Research Institute, located just around the corner from his former laboratory. This position has allowed Cris, in a state of semi-retirement, to perform individual research projects supported by small grants 9 . Still heavily involved in collaborative research, Cris’s most recent research effort concerned the analysis of cardiac tissue damage arising from COVID-19 infection (Bos et al.  2020 ). Through telephone conversation, Cris explained that he had a hunch that related high levels of ACE2 expression on cardiac tissue to heart damage and thought that this may be an important factor in understanding the current systemic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such a clear, concise, direct and enthusiastic approach to formulating hypotheses and carrying out research will be a lasting legacy of Cris dos Remedios and all the scientists he has trained through the course of his career. On the occasion of his 80 th  birthday, we, along with all those contributing to this Special Issue, wish him well and continued future research success. </Body>

    <Title>Adaptations of cytoarchitecture in human dilated cardiomyopathy</Title>

    <Abstact>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is characterised by a histological phenotype of myocyte disarray, but heart tissue samples from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) often look comparatively similar to those from healthy individuals apart from conspicuous regions of fibrosis and necrosis. We have previously investigated subcellular alterations in the cytoarchitecture of mouse models of dilated cardiomyopathy and found that both the organisation and composition of the intercalated disc, i.e. the specialised type of cell–cell contact in the heart, is altered. There is also is a change in the composition of the M-band of the sarcomere due to an expression shift towards the more extensible embryonic heart (EH)-myomesin isoform. Analysis of human samples from the Sydney Human Heart Tissue Bank have revealed similar structural findings and also provided evidence for a dramatic change in overall cardiomyocyte size control, which has also been seen in the mouse. Together these changes in cytoarchitecture probably contribute to the decreased functional output that is seen in DCM.</Abstact>
    <Body>In human heart disease the heart changes in one of two ways, either hypertrophy or dilation (Seidman and Seidman  2001 ). In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the walls of the ventricle thicken, which leads to a restricted chamber volume. HCM is usually identified histologically by a marked pattern of myocyte disarray in addition to fibrosis. HCM is additionally characterised by the re-expression of a set of marker genes that are usually not detectable in the postnatal heart, including those for atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or of the embryonic isoforms of, for example, contractile proteins such as myosin and actin (MacLellan and Schneider  2000 ; Copeland et al.  2010 ). In dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), the heart balloons and the chamber volume increases (Seidman and Seidman  2001 ). This condition can be accompanied by a thinning of the ventricular wall. The heart tissue of DCM patients can have an apparently normal appearance at the histological level, with nicely arranged strands of myocytes running in parallel. While there are areas of necrosis and fibrosis, often the majority of the tissue looks comparatively normal, thereby providing no good explanation for the dramatic failure in function that is seen at the physiological level. To date, only a very limited number of molecular markers specific for DCM have been defined. Alterations at the cellular level in mouse models of dilated cardiomyopathy Our research group initially set out to explore potential alterations at the cellular level in DCM by employing mouse models of this disease (for a schematic representation of a single cardiomyocyte and its main structural components, see Fig.  1 ). In a first study, we used the MLP knockout mouse, which is the first genetically modified mouse model of DCM (Arber et al.  1997 ). We then went on to confirm our observations in a tropomodulin-overexpressing transgenic mouse (Sussman et al.  1998 ) and in a mouse that expressed a non-degradable version of the adherens junction protein beta-catenin (Hirschy et al.  2010 ). These studies focussed on the expression and localisation of different cytoskeletal proteins in the specialised type of cell–cell contacts found in the heart (intercalated discs) or in myofibrils. At the intercalated discs we saw a dramatic upregulation of proteins that anchor the sarcomeric actin filaments. Cytoplasmic components of the adherens junctions, such as beta-catenin and plakoglobin and their transmembrane counterpart, the catenins, were upregulated, contributing to an increased width of signal at the intercalated disc, as observed by immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy (Ehler et al.  2001 ). The expression levels of desmosomal proteins were unchanged, but the levels of connexin-43, a component of the gap junctions involved in ion transfer between cardiomyocytes, were reduced. We also detected increased expression of nebulin-related anchoring protein (NRAP) and formin-homology-domain-containing protein 1 (FHOD1). Both are located at the intercalated disc, and the latter is a member of the formin family of regulators of actin filament formation (Ehler et al.  2001 ; Dwyer et al.  2014 ). The increased width at the intercalated disc seen by light microscopy following staining for actin-associated proteins was explained as an increased degree of membrane convolution, as has also been seen in ultrastructural analysis (Ehler et al.  2001 ). Fig. 1 Schematic representation of an isolated adult cardiomyocyte. The regions of cell–cell contact, i.e. the intercalated discs, are situated at both ends of the cell. The cytoplasm is filled with myofibrils (just one shown here), which are arranged in a paracrystalline fashion and have sarcomeres which stretch between two Z-discs as the basic unit. Actin and its associated proteins (thin filaments,  yellow ) are found in the I-band, and myosin and its associated proteins (thick filaments,  dark blue ) are found in the A-band. One titin molecule (elastic filaments,  red ) stretches from the Z-disc to the M-band (shown in  magenta ), which is in the middle of each sarcomere and links the elastic filament system with the myosin filaments. The transitional junction ( TrJ ) is a proposed site for insertion of new sarcomeres in the region of the intercalated disc. At the sides the myofibrils are linked at Z-disc level with the surrounding extracellular matrix by structures called costameres 
 Most sarcomeric proteins, such as alpha-actinin (a component of the Z-disc), myomesin (a component of the M-band) and thin and thick filament proteins [cardiac actin, sarcomeric myosin or MyBP-C (muscle protein myosin binding protein C)] do not alter their expression levels or their localisation patterns in DCM (Ehler et al.  2001 ). Schoenauer et al. ( 2011 ) observed a shift in isoform expression of myomesin towards the expression of EH (embryonic heart)-myomesin, which is usually predominant only in the embryonic heart muscle and in slow muscle. The myomesin molecule is made up almost exclusively of immunoglobulin and fibronectin type III domains (Agarkova et al.  2000 ), similar to other myosin binding proteins, such as MyBP-C and titin. EH-myomesin has an insertion of a domain in the middle of the myomesin molecule that appears to function in an analogous way to the PEVK domain of titin and displays more elastic properties in biophysical assays (Schoenauer et al.  2005 ). The composition of the M-band can be correlated to muscle type and developmental stage (Agarkova and Perriard  2005 ), and it has been speculated that this more extensible domain in EH-myomesin may be required for the function of myofibrils that have not perfectly aligned thick filaments, such as in the embryonic heart (Manasek  1968 ; Agarkova and Perriard  2005 ). In DCM, a similar switch in expression to a more extensible, embryonic isoform of a protein has been reported for titin (Makarenko et al.  2004 ), an elastic filament protein that spans all the way from the Z-disc to the M-band. Can similar changes be observed in samples from human patients with dilated cardiomyopathy? Since inbred mouse strains are not necessarily representative of the heterogenous human population, the aim of our research group for several years has been to try to determine whether similar cytoskeletal alterations can also be seen in human hearts from DCM patients using samples from the Sydney Human Heart Tissue Bank that had always been stored in liquid nitrogen. Different types of DCM, as classified by the clinicians, were analysed in these studies, including idiopathic DCM (IDCM), familial DCM (FDCM) and DCM following a viral infection (VDCM). Our initial analysis of different human DCM samples by immunohistochemistry followed by confocal microscopy revealed an increase in size distribution when the outlines of the cardiomyocytes were delineated by staining for beta-catenin and laminin. The traditional assumption is that DCM is caused by a general elongation of the cardiomyocytes that is accompanied by their slippage, leading to a thinning of the ventricular wall. Our measurements showed that while cardiomyocytes from non-failing hearts showed relatively little variability in size, diameter or length, cardiomyocytes from DCM patients of different etiologies were always characterised by an increased variation in these parameters (Fig.  2 ; Table  1 ). These findings mirror our initial studies on mouse models of DCM where we saw more variability in size—and not necessarily just elongation—of the cardiomyocytes (Leu et al.  2001 ; Hirschy et al.  2010 ). These observations suggest that the thinner wall of the DCM ventricle cannot always be explained solely by longer cells and that during the course of the disease cardiomyocytes lose some degree of size control. The signalling pathways which control cardiomyocyte growth are not very well understood at present (Földes et al.  2011 ). Fig. 2 Analysis of size parameters of non-failing healthy cardiomyocytes and failing cardiomyocytes in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Failing (DCM) cardiomyocytes show a larger range of measurements, indicating a departure from the usually narrow distribution of physiological size. Cell dimensions were obtained from confocal micrographs of longitudinally sections of cardiomyocytes stained with antibodies against beta-catenin and laminin to delineate the cell borders and myomesin.

 a Non-failing and DCM heart sample sections were stained for laminin and beta-catenin to delineate the cell borders and myomesin for cardiomyocyte identification. The slides were co-stained with DAPI to indicate nuclei, and individual cells were measured at the nucleus level using LAS AF Lite software (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) 
 When intercalated disc composition was analysed, we again observed increased protein levels for plakoglobin at the intercalated discs of the failing (DCM) patients compared to the non-failing controls (Fig.  3 ). This protein is found in adherens junctions, which anchor actin filaments, and in desmosomes, which anchor intermediate filaments. The concept that these two types of cell–cell contacts are clearly separated in cardiomyocytes has been recently challenged by the proposal of the “area composita”, demonstrated in the hearts of a variety of species, including humans (Franke et al.  2006 ). Interestingly, in samples from failing human hearts, a consistent downregulation of connexin-43 expression is not found: in some patients it is reduced, while in others the levels are comparable to those found in non-failing tissue (Pluess and Ehler, manuscript in preparation). At present it is unclear why failing (DCM) cardiomyocytes in humans respond differently to those in mice, but the effects of patient medication on connexin-43 expression cannot be excluded. Fig. 3 Increased signal for plakoglobin at the intercalated disc of DCM tissue samples. Confocal micrographs of cryosections from non-failing (healthy;  NF ) control and failing hearts (DCM). The intercalated discs were stained with monoclonal mouse antibodies against plakoglobin ( red  signal in overlay), the myofibrils were stained with polyclonal rabbit antibodies against the titin m8 epitope ( green  signal in overlay) and the nuclei were visualised with DAPI ( blue  signal in overlay). An increased width of signal for plakoglobin is apparent at the intercalated discs from tissue samples of different DCM patients compared to tissue from control (healthy) patients ( arrowheads ). A signal at the lateral edges of the cardiomyocytes can be occasionally detected in DCM ( arrow ) 
 We found the general arrangement of sarcomeric proteins to be unaffected in both human and mouse DCM samples. As can be appreciated from the localisation pattern for titin or myomesin shown in Figs.  3  and  4 , the cross-striations resemble those of the controls, i.e. there is not much evidence of dramatic myofibril disarray. Similar to the mouse, re-expression of EH-myomesin was also detected in human DCM hearts (Fig.  4 ). Upregulation of the expression of this embryonic isoform was seen in some cardiomyocytes and not in others. We made use of a tissue array with different cardiomyopathy samples and stained it for EH-myomesin expression. Analysis of the extent of expression revealed that there was a good correlation between high expression and IDCM and FDCM, but that lower expression of EH-myomesin occurred in HCM and non-failing hearts (Fig.  5 ). This makes EH-myomesin a potential marker for DCM. However, it must be noted that EH-myomesin is also expressed in the conduction system of the heart, particularly in the interventricular septum (Meysen et al.  2007 ); therefore it is important to note the location in the ventricle where the samples are taken. Fig. 4 The more extensible, embryonic isoform of the M-band protein myomesin ( EH-myomesin ) is re-expressed in a cell-autonomous manner in DCM. Confocal micrographs of cryosections from non-failing healthy and DCM hearts. The M-bands were stained with monoclonal mouse antibodies against myomesin ( red  signal in overlay), the EH-myomesin isoform was stained with polyclonal rabbit antibodies against the human EH domain ( green  signal in overlay) and the nuclei were visualised with DAPI ( blue  signal in overlay). While no  green  signal can be detected in the healthy human heart, individual cardiomyocytes show a re-expression of EH-myomesin 
 Fig. 5 EH-myomesin expression is increased in IDCM and FDCM compared to HCM and healthy tissue samples. Quantification of pixel intensity from a tissue array containing 108 tissue spots for 54 individuals, stained with anti-human EH-myomesin antibodies and analysed by confocal microscopy. The values were grouped according to the underlying disease. A median of the weighted averages was determined for each subgroup: IDCM = 41.6; FDCM = 40.4; HCM = 28.1; non-failing healthy controls = 22.2 
 Approximately 25 % of cases of FDCM are caused by truncation of the titin gene (Herman et al.  2012 ). Next generation sequencing (NGS) of FDCM in the samples in the Sydney Human Heart Tissue Bank has commenced only recently, and no results have yet been published. Fürst et al. ( 1988 ) reported a monoclonal antibody (clone T12) against the N-terminal region of titin that recognises an epitope at the edge of the Z-disc, and Obermann et al. ( 1996 ) located a polyclonal antibody against the C-terminal titin m8 domain at the M-band. In all of the samples we have analysed to date, these two antibodies have revealed clear alterations of titin striations at apparently similar levels of intensity throughout the section (Fig.  6  and unpublished data). This result is surprising, since our expectation was fainter staining for the C-terminal epitope in some of the samples if they originated from patients with a truncated titin. However, since we currently have no NGS information on the genetic status of the samples used in our studies, we do not know whether these patients carry mutations in the titin gene that would lead to a truncated protein. Another complication of this research is that mutant titin may not necessarily be expressed at the expected ratio, which is 50 % since all the patients will be heterozygous. In the case of MyBP-C, truncating mutations can also cause HCM, and for this disease a haploinsufficiency mechanism has been proposed (Marston et al.  2009 ). Truncated MyBP-C has never been detected at the protein level, leading to the proposal that nonsense-mediated decay of the mRNA prevents its production (van Dijk et al.  2009 ) and may even prevent the translation in cases of point mutations in MyBP-C (Vignier et al.  2009 ). Mutations in other sarcomeric proteins, such as myosin, are not expressed at the expected 50 % ratio, but can be expressed at variable levels between patients and even between cardiomyocytes (Tripathi et al.  2011 ). The first report on a titin mutation causing DCM did show the existence of a truncated titin protein (Gerull et al.  2002 ). However, no biochemical analysis of titin has been carried out on the DCM samples available to us to date. Fig. 6 The titin T12 and m8 epitopes are stained with equal intensity in longitudinal sections of different DCM samples. Confocal micrographs of cryosections from non-failing (healthy;  NF ) and DCM hearts. The T12 epitope of titin in the Z-disc region was stained with monoclonal mouse antibodies ( red  signal). The m8 epitope of titin was stained with polyclonal rabbit antibodies ( green  signal) at the M-band. The Sydney Human Heart Tissue Bank patient codes are indicated.  Scale bar : 2 μm 
 Dilated cardiomyopathy: From cellular to functional phenotype? What are the functional consequences of the changes that we observed in the DCM samples from mice and (wo)men? The higher variability in cell size will obviously affect the three-dimensional composition of the heart tissue and may be one of the explanations why we see these alterations in the cell–cell contact sites, i.e. the intercalated discs (for schematic representation of changes in DCM see Fig.  7 ). Suboptimal co-ordination between cell size and force per cell may necessitate an increase in actin anchorage to prevent tissue disintegration during contraction. It remains to be seen whether the formin FHOD1, detected at elevated levels at the intercalated discs of DCM in mice and humans (Dwyer et al.  2014 ), is responsible for the increased actin filament formation. The importance of the proper stoichiometry of expression of adherens junction protein resulting in heart failure has been reviewed elsewhere (Perriard et al.  2003 ; Vite and Radice  2014 ). NRAP is the first reported protein to be upregulated in the course of DCM (Ehler et al.  2001 ). Transgenic mice that overexpress this protein have dilated hearts and develop right ventricular dysfunction (Lu et al.  2011 ). The composition of the intercalated disc is important because it is the major site for the insertion of new sarcomeres during growth of the adult heart (Yoshida et al.  2010 ). In DCM hearts, this otherwise carefully regulated process leads to altered “step sizes” between the cells that no longer follow the “one step amounts to the length of one sarcomere” rule (Wilson et al.  2014 ). These irregularities are probably the basis for the increased degree of membrane convolution that is seen in the DCM heart and has also been reported for the aged heart (Forbes and Sperelakis  1985 ; Ehler et al.  2001 ). Other potential consequences of irregular tissue composition are fibrosis and changes in intercalated disc architecture that lead to an increased risk of arrhythmic events. Reduced expression of the gap junction protein connexin-43, as observed in all mouse models of DCM and a subset of the human patients, will impair intercellular communication and thus interfere with the efficient propagation of stimuli that produce contraction. In addition, lateral deposition of proteins such as plakoglobin and erroneous lateral gap junctions will contribute to a more arrhythmogenic phenotype (Severs et al.  2008 ). Fig. 7 Schematic representations of the alterations at the level of the heart tissue ( a ) and the cardiomyocyte ( b ) in healthy and DCM hearts.  a  While the alignment of the cardiomyocytes is not greatly affected in DCM, there are patches of fibrosis ( yellow ) and a wider variation in cell size that lead to impaired coupling between cardiomyocytes. A subset of the cardiomyocytes ( darker colour ) re-express EH-myomesin.  b  The membrane at the intercalated discs is more convoluted in DCM cardiomyocytes. This is accompanied by an increased presence of actin anchoring adherens junctions ( blue ). The alignment of the myofibrils is unaffected, but there is an isoform shift in myomesin expression of the more extensible EH-myomesin at the M-band ( darker striations ) 
 The general composition of the myofibrils and arrangement of sarcomeres seems to be little affected in DCM, and myofibril disarray also appears to be minimal. There may be a failure in myofibril maintenance, which will eventually lead to shrinking of the cardiomyocytes or necrosis. For example, we correlated decreased expression levels of another formin, the muscle isoform of FHOD3, with human heart failure (Iskratsch et al.  2010 ). The composition of the M-band of the sarcomere is changed and reverts to a more embryonic phenotype. At present it is unclear whether the cell autonomous re-expression of EH-myomesin is beneficial. Schoenauer et al. ( 2011 ) reported that high EH-myomesin levels are correlated with a decrease in cardiac function in human samples. On the other hand, the initial reversion to embryonic phenotypes of myomesin and titin isoforms may be an adaptation to cope with increased mechanical stress. In the human samples we examined higher expression levels of EH-myomesin correlated with a longstanding disease and a low ejection fraction (Pluess and Ehler, manuscript in preparation). The above observations point to the complimentary nature of the interactions of titin and myomesin and provide plausible explanations for the changes observed in DCM heart failure. In summary, alterations that are seen at the level of tissue composition and in the arrangement of the cytoskeleton of cardiomyocytes appear to contribute to the functional changes that are seen at the level of physiology. </Body>

    <Title>Enhanced and effective conformational sampling of protein molecular systems for their free energy landscapes</Title>

    <Abstact>Protein folding and protein–ligand docking have long persisted as important subjects in biophysics. Using multicanonical molecular dynamics (McMD) simulations with realistic expressions, i.e., all-atom protein models and an explicit solvent, free-energy landscapes have been computed for several systems, such as the folding of peptides/proteins composed of a few amino acids up to nearly 60 amino-acid residues, protein–ligand interactions, and coupled folding and binding of intrinsically disordered proteins. Recent progress in conformational sampling and its applications to biophysical systems are reviewed in this report, including descriptions of several outstanding studies. In addition, an algorithm and detailed procedures used for multicanonical sampling are presented along with the methodology of adaptive umbrella sampling. Both methods control the simulation so that low-probability regions along a reaction coordinate are sampled frequently. The reaction coordinate is the potential energy for multicanonical sampling and is a structural identifier for adaptive umbrella sampling. One might imagine that this probability control invariably enhances conformational transitions among distinct stable states, but this study examines the enhanced conformational sampling of a simple system and shows that reasonably well-controlled sampling slows the transitions. This slowing is induced by a rapid change of entropy along the reaction coordinate. We then provide a recipe to speed up the sampling by loosening the rapid change of entropy. Finally, we report all-atom McMD simulation results of various biophysical systems in an explicit solvent.</Abstact>
    <Body>Introduction Large-scale intramolecular conformational motions are necessary for protein folding, with large intramolecular translational/rotational motions causing protein–ligand binding. With the rapidly increasing capabilities of computers, the study of these motions has come to be an important computational task. To trace large motions, fast computers specialized for molecular simulations, such as MDGRAPE-3 (Narumi et al.  2006 ) and ANTON (Shaw et al.  2007 ; Maragakis et al.  2008 ), might be useful. An alternative useful approach is the use of a source program that is especially coded for rapid processing, such as GROMACS (van der Spoel et al.  2005 ). A generalized ensemble method is also an alternative means to accelerate conformational sampling (Mitsutake et al.  2001 ). This algorithmic approach is useful whether or not fast computers or suitable programs are used. Protein conformational sampling is equivalent to an exploration of a conformational space, which is an abstract space used to completely express the structural variety of a protein. When the protein consists of  N 
 aa  amino-acid residues, the number of degrees of freedom to specify any allowable protein structure is approximately proportional to  N 
 aa . It is likely that a power law of  N 
 aa  approximates the volume  V 
 cs  of the conformational space for the protein as 1 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

				\begin{document}$$ {V_{\text{cs}}} \propto s_{\text{p}}^{{N{\text{aa}}}}, $$\end{document} where  s 
 p  is a constant that is specific to the protein system. Then,  V 
 cs  increases rapidly with increasing  N 
 aa , and the conformational sampling is confronted with a difficulty. Actually, rigorous all-atom computations of peptides in explicit solvent have demonstrated that three-residue prolongation of  N 
 aa  expands  V 
 cs  by tenfold (Ikebe et al.  2011a ). Furthermore, numerous low-energy basins (energetically stable structures) or narrow energetic pinholes distributed widely in the conformational space trap the conformation during the simulation. A larger basin has a lower free energy than a smaller one. Consequently, it is desirable that the sampling method be able to both escape from basins and also be able to measure the basin size. Protein simplification is a useful computational technique to study the overall features of protein folding (Go  1983 ; Dill  1985 ; Miyazawa and Jernigan  1985 ; Bryngelson et al.  1995 ). The Go-like model (Go  1983 ) modulates the potential energy in advance so that the native protein structure has the lowest energy. It can then predict the folding core regions (Koga and Takada  2001 ) and the folding kinetics (Munoz and Eaton  1999 ) for two-state proteins. The smoothing of the potential energy surface speeds up the protein conformational motions considerably. In an all-atom simulation, in contrast, the conformation is easily trapped in a local energy basin during a prolonged simulation time: once the conformation escapes from the basin, another basin traps it, and so on. This repetition of trapping-and-escape is likely to be the real picture of the protein folding occurring in a time scale that is too short to be identified experimentally. Consequently, all-atom simulation is an indispensable research step to ascertain the details of molecular events. When a protein is bound to its partner molecule, the two molecules move in space to form a complex. In theory, numerous complex modes are possible. Additionally, once a complex is formed in the simulation, the thermodynamic stability of the complex should be examined. Consequently, the sampling is expected to be sufficiently powerful to produce various complexes and to estimate the binding free energy for each complex accurately. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), classified as a new protein group, are structurally disordered in the free state (unbound state) and adopt well-defined tertiary structures upon binding to their partner molecules (Wright and Dyson  1999 ; Sugase et al.  2007 ). In terms of IDP function, therefore, the binding is coupled indivisibly with the folding. As the time scale for this process is too short to be traced experimentally, a computer simulation is a key approach to study this process. However, one must solve the folding and binding in parallel, which necessitates higher sampling efficiency than solving either folding or binding alone. As described in this paper, we review the multicanonical simulation, which is compatible with the all-atom treatment of proteins in explicit solvent. This method can assign free energies (i.e., statistical weights) to the energy basins. Therefore, a realistic free-energy landscape is obtained by mapping/projecting the sampled conformations in the conformational space. The multicanonical algorithm was originally introduced to study a physical system, namely, a two-dimensional Potts model (Berg and Neuhaus  1992 ), and was applied to polypeptide systems combined with a Monte Carlo simulation (Hansmann and Okamoto  1993 ; Kidera  1995 ). Subsequently, the algorithm was combined with a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to study large fluctuations of a peptide (Hansmann et al.  1996 ; Nakajima et al.  1997b ). Nakajima’s MD version, denoted as McMD in this paper, solves the Newtonian equations in Cartesian coordinate space, while Hansmann’s version integrates the equations in a dihedral-angular space. In the all-atom treatment, a protein consists of densely packed atoms, and solvent atoms tightly surround the protein. The Monte Carlo simulation is unsuitable for such a crowded-atom system because most trial conformations result in rejection by atomic bumps. Consequently, the adoption of MD is extremely important. The McMD simulation has been applied to various systems, from a two-residue peptide (Nakajima et al.  2000 ) to a 57-residue protein (Ikebe et al.  2011b ), and applied to protein–ligand flexible docking (Nakajima et al.  1997a ,  b ; Kamiya et al.  2008 ). A trajectory-parallelization method has been developed (Higo et al.  2009 ; Ikebe et al.  2011a ) to increase the sampling efficiency still further, and this method has been applied to the coupled folding and binding of an IPD to generate the free-energy landscape (Higo et al.  2011 ). Another useful simulation method used to generate the free-energy landscape is the replica-exchange method (REM). Herein we briefly mention this method, although we do not specifically examine this method in this review. REM was introduced to study an Ising spin glass system combined with the Monte Carlo simulation (Hukushima and Nemoto  1996 ) and applied to a biological system combined with canonical MD (Sugita and Okamoto  1999 ). A user executes multiple runs of the same system (replicas) at different temperatures in parallel and tries to exchange the temperatures among different replicas with reference to a physicochemical exchange probability between the replicas. When the exchange is accepted frequently, the replicas are relaxed thermally, and the sampled conformations are used to generate the free-energy landscape. To increase the exchange probability, the replica-exchange and multicanonical methods are combined (Sugita and Okamoto  2000 ) or a microcanonical MD version is used (Kar et al.  2009 ). An optimal choice of replica set has been discussed (Trebst et al.  2006 ). Furthermore, this method was generalized for exchanging parameters other than temperature (Sugita et al.  2000 ), and it was extended to a Hamiltonian-exchange form (Fukunishi et al.  2002 ). Another generalized-ensemble replica-exchange method has been proposed to focus on the first-order transition phenomena (Kim et al.  2010 ). As explained later, the multicanonical simulation controls the sampling so that the energy distribution converges to a desired form. One can imagine a simulation in which a distribution function of another parameter than energy converges to a desired form, as introduced by Paine and Scheraga ( 1985 ) or Mezei ( 1987 ). This sampling method is now called ‘the adaptive umbrella (AU) sampling’. The multicanonical and AU sampling methods therefore are similar in terms of their methodology. This review report describes the methodology of AU sampling as well as that of multicanonical sampling. In this review, we begin with an introductory/preparative section (‘ Preparation ’) in which we provide a general explanation of conformational sampling; this is followed by two sections ‘ Adaptive umbrella sampling ’ and ‘ Multicanonical sampling ’, respectively, which describe in detail the theory of AU and multicanonical methods. We then solve a simple protein–ligand docking problem to show that the AU method does not always enhance sampling (‘ Traffic slowing in enhanced sampling ’) and provide a recipe to drastically increase the sampling efficiency (‘ Traffic enhancement ’). This recipe provides an important supplement tor both the AU and multicanonical methods. Next, we explain actual procedures for multicanonical and AU methods (sections ‘ Actual procedure for multicanonical sampling ’ and ‘ Actual procedure for adaptive umbrella sampling ’) and provide some technical sections (‘ Methods to update the canonical distribution ’, ‘ TTP-multicanonical sampling ’, and ‘ Other computational techniques ’). After the free-energy landscape (‘ Free-energy landscape ’) is explained we further describe the results of the McMD simulations of various biophysical systems expressed by the all-atom model in explicit solvent (‘ All-atom McMD simulations of various systems ’). Preparation In this section, we provide a general description of conformational sampling to produce a canonical ensemble, which is linked smoothly to the discussion in the next section on enhanced conformational sampling. Consider that a system consists of biomolecular and solvent-molecular atoms. We express the position of atom  i  in the system by its Cartesian coordinates:  x 
 i ,  y 
 i , and  z 
 i . Then, a microscopic state of the system is expressed completely using a vector  r  as 2 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

 y , and  e 
 z  respectively represent the unit vectors parallel to the  x -,  y - and  z -coordinate axes. It has not been generally proved that an MD simulation trajectory always converges to the canonical distribution  ρ 
 c ( r , T ). However, many MD studies have assumed convergence because energy dissipation occurs extensively in the atom-crowded system (biological system) when the simulation temperature is controlled appropriately (Evans and Morriss  1983 ; Nose  1984 ; Hoover  1985 ). The MD and MC methods described above are generally regarded as  canonical sampling  and the sampled conformations as a  canonical ensemble . However, canonical sampling does not guarantee a quick convergence of the simulation trajectory to the canonical ensemble. In fact, very slow convergence is often experienced when a large and complicated system is simulated. To avoid this difficulty, enhanced conformational sampling has been proposed. Adaptive umbrella sampling The energy surface of a biological system is generally vast and bumpy. Therefore, acceleration for the sampling is crucial. Here we introduce a modified potential energy  h ( r ), which is an arbitrary single-valued function that is differentiable with respect to the atomic coordinates { x 
 1 ,…, z 
 N }. Accordingly, the detailed balance between the microscopic states m A  and m B  is defined as 11 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

 Equation  19  shows that a sufficiently long simulation produces a flat distribution on the λ axis. This property of  E 
 u ( r ) may enhance the sampling in a following situation: presuming that the canonical distribution  P 
 c (λ, T ) is a bimodal distribution function (broken line in Fig.  1 a) where the conformation is stable at around λ 1  and λ 2  and unstable at around λ = λ mid  (Fig.  1 a), then the transitions between the stable states might be rare in the canonical sampling. In contrast,  P 
 u (λ, T ) is flat (solid line in Fig.  1 a). Therefore, we expect that the inter-state transitions using  E 
 u ( r ) are more frequent than those obtained by canonical sampling, as presented in Fig.  1 b. Figure  1  was prepared so that λ, called the  reaction coordinate , is a good parameter to discriminate the stable and unstable states. Fig. 1

 The usual aim of AU sampling is to generate a flat 1D distribution on the λ axis at equilibrium (Eq.  19 ). However, one might want to generate a non-flat distribution instead of a flat one. We can see that the flat distribution is a particular case of the non-flat distribution. We therefore redefine the modified potential function  E

 mc  is a normalization constant. This simulation is called multicanonical simulation or multicanonical sampling. The aim of multicanonical sampling is to speed up energy relaxation. In this context, therefore, multicanonical sampling does not directly aim to speed up structural relaxation. However, energy barriers separate thermodynamically stable structures in the  N -dimensional conformational space. Consequently, structural relaxation is related to energy relaxation. Figure  2 a shows the conformational space characterized by  E . In canonical sampling at a high temperature  T 
 high , the conformation ascends into the high-energy regions without descending into energy barriers (red line in Fig.  2 a), and the energy distribution  P 
 c ( E , T 
 high ) is narrow (red line in Fig.  2 b). Consequently, the room temperature ( T 
 room ) structures in the oblique-line region are seldom sampled. In contrast, at a low temperature  T 
 low , the conformation is trapped in an energy basin (blue line in Fig.  2 a), and the energy distribution  P 
 c ( E , T 
 low ) is narrow (blue line in Fig.  2 b). Therefore, the escape from the basin requires a considerably long simulation time. Although we might obtain some room temperature structures in this basin, we cannot judge whether those structures are biophysically more important than those in other basins because the trajectory visited only one basin. Multicanonical sampling explores both the high-energy regions and low-energy basins (black line in Fig.  2 a), yielding a flat energy distribution  P 
 mc  (black line in Fig.  2 b). Fig. 2

 The AU sampling procedure is effective when an essential reaction coordinate is known, along which biophysically important structures are well discriminated. Multicanonical sampling is suitable to sample the entire conformational space and to generate the entire free-energy landscape. We can identify thermodynamically important energy basins and the free-energy barriers in the conformational ensemble at a desired temperature. Traffic slowing in enhanced sampling Enhanced conformational sampling controls the distribution as  P 
 u (λ, T ) =  g (λ) or  P 
 mc ( E , T ) =  g ( E ). Therefore, the sampling indirectly controls the traffic of conformation along the λ or  E  axis as a by-product of the probability control (see Figs.  1 b and  2 a). Below we solve a simple protein–ligand docking problem by AU sampling and show that the probability-control does not always enhance the traffic, contrary to our expectations. Here we consider a simple system mimicking protein–ligand binding. First, we prepare a large box designated as ‘LC’ in Fig.  3 a. The x-, y-, and z-coordinate axes are defined so that they are parallel to the box sides, with the origin set on the body center of the LC box. Next, the LC box is divided into 3D cubic lattices with dimensions of 241 3 , where 241 (= 2 × 120 + 1) lattice points line up along each of the coordinate axes. The ligand is represented as a particle (open circle in Fig.  3 a) moving on the 3D lattice points. The ligand position ( r 
 x 
 , r 
 y 
 , r 
 z ) is then conditioned as −120 ≤  r 
 x  ≤120, –120 ≤  r 
 y  ≤ 20, and −120 ≤  r 
 z  ≤ 20. The smaller box, designated as ‘PC’ in Fig.  3 a, is the protein of which the dimensions are 7 3 : seven lattice points line up along each of the x-, y-, and z-axes. Figure  3 b shows a cross-section (x–y plane with  z  = 0) of the system. The body center of PC is set at the coordinate origin, at which the ligand-binding site (filled circle of Fig.  3 b) is also set. A cuboid-shaped hole, mimicking the ligand binding cleft, is caved on the plane of  x  = 3 of PC, for which the dimensions are 5 × 3 × 3 (Fig.  3 b). The ligand then accesses the binding site through the hole. We also assume that the ligand can access the lattice points on the protein surface (open circles in Fig.  3b ) but cannot enter into the protein interior (gray region in Fig.  3 b). There are 89 sites in the inhibited region. The number of the accessible sites for the ligand is then 13,997,432 (= 241 3  – 89). We set the potential energy as zero ( E  = 0) at any accessible site to assess an entropy effect in the sampling. Below we examine two sampling methods: non-enhanced sampling and AU sampling. Fig. 3

The origin of the x-, y-, and z-axes (  arrows x ,  y ,  z , respectively) is set at the center of LC. The center of PC is also set on the origin.  Zigzag line  Ligand motions. The  cuboid hole  in PC mimics a cleft through which the ligand access to the ligand-binding site.  b  Cross section [x–y plane ( arrows x ,  y , respectively, with z = 0] of PC to show the cuboid hole and the ligand-binding site ( filled circle ).  Lattice points , labeled such as (−3, 3, 0), are the edge positions of the PC,  open circles  PC-surface lattice points, at which the ligand can access. The ligand cannot access the interior of the PC ( gray region ) 
 The non-enhanced sampling is a conventional Monte-Carlo sampling. The ligand was initially put randomly at a lattice point with excluding a case in which the ligand is buried in the protein interior and then moved randomly to the nearest neighbor lattice points. The moves were accepted unconditionally (remember that  E  is always zero), except for a motion to outside the LC box or the protein interior. We estimated the average interval for the reciprocation of the ligand between the binding site and a ‘Far region’ (| r 
 x | ≥ 100, | r 
 y | ≥ 100, or | r 
 z | ≥ 100) presented in  Fig.  4 , as follows: once the ligand reached the binding site at a step number  N 
 b , we memorized this number and waited until the ligand reached the Far region, for which the step number is denoted as  N 
 f . Before reaching the Far region, the ligand might revisit the binding site. However, we did not reset  N 
 b  to the revisiting step. The trajectory interval for this motion was then defined as Δ N 
 fb  =  N 
 f  –  N 
 b . We then waited until the ligand visited the binding site, for which the step number is denoted again as  N 
 b . Before accessing the binding site, the ligand might revisit the Far region. However, we did not reset  N 
 f  to the revisiting step. We then calculated the interval for this motion as Δ N 
 bf  =  N 
 b  –  N 
 f . The simulation was continued, the reciprocation was observed many times, and the average for the intervals was calculated as &lt;Δ N  &gt; = (&lt;Δ N 
 fb  &gt; + &lt; Δ N 
 bf &gt;)/2, where &lt;Δ N 
 fb  &gt; and &lt;Δ N 
 bf  &gt; represent the average of Δ N 
 fb  and Δ N 
 bf , respectively. This simulation was performed four times, with each run executed for 5 × 10 12  steps, discarding the initial 10 8  steps to compute &lt;Δ N &gt;. We used the Mersenne twister MT19937 (Matsumoto and Nishimura  1998 ) to generate a random number series. The resultant value was &lt; ΔN&gt; = (2.53 ± 0.02) ×   10 7 , where the ligand moved about 197,000 times between the binding site and the Far region. Fig. 4 Two-dimensional drawing to identify the space partitioning. Protein ( PC ) is located at the center of the LC box.  State 1  Ligand-binding cleft, with the ligand-binding site at the center of State 1, which overlaps the center of PC. In the two-state adaptive sampling, the region other than State 1 (i.e., State 2 + State 3 + State 4) is called the ‘Other region’. Boundary 1 partitions States 1 and 2, Boundary 2 partitions States 2 and 3, and Boundary 3 partitions States 3 and 4. The ‘Far region’ is a part of State 4. Positions of Boundaries 2 and 3 are specified uniquely by L 2  and L 3 , respectively, which are intercepts of the boundaries to the x-axis 
 The next step in the AU sampling is to enhance the probability of the ligand in the binding cleft. As such, we defined State 1 as having dimensions of −1 ≤  r 
 x  ≤ 1, –1 ≤  r 
 y  ≤ 1, and −1 ≤  r 
 z  ≤ 1, as portrayed in Fig.  4 . The binding site is located at the center of State 1. We controlled the distribution as  P 
 State1  =  P 
 Other , where  P 
 State1  and  P 
 Other  denote the probabilities of the ligand in State 1 and the ‘Other region’, respectively. States 2, 3, and 4 in Fig.  4  (States 2 + 3 + 4 = Other region) are described in the next section. We designate this adaptive umbrella sampling as the ‘two-state AU sampling’ or simply ‘two-state sampling’. Boundary 1 separates State 1 and the Other region (Fig.  4 ). The numbers ( N 
 State1  and  N 
 Other ) of ligand accessible sites are 27 and 13,997,405, respectively, for State 1 and the Other region. The transition probability of the ligand traversing Boundary 1 from State 1 to the Other region is  N 
 State1 / N 
 Other . This setting of the transition probability is explained later. The transition for the reversal process is accepted unconditionally. Other moves are always accepted. We repeated the simulation four times, with each run executed for 5 × 10 12  steps and discarding the initial 10 8  steps. The resultant interval is &lt; ΔN &gt; = (2.81 ± 0.01) ×  10 7 , where the ligand moved about 178,000 times between the binding site and the Far region. The probabilities were controlled well as  P 
 State1 / P 
 Other  = 0.998. This probability partitioning is in contrast to the result from the non-enhanced sampling:  P 
 State1  /  P 
 Other  = 0.193 × 10 –5 . Consequently, the two-state AU sampling enhanced  P 
 State1 . In return, this sampling slowed traffic &lt; Δ N &gt;, as shown above. For the ligand starting from the Far region, the probability of visiting State 1 is the same for each of the two simulations because all moves are unconditionally accepted in both. For the ligand starting from the binding site, all moves are also accepted unconditionally in the non-enhanced simulation. In contrast, in the two-state AU simulation, the ligand traverses Boundary 1 with the small transition probability  N 
 State1 / N 
 Other , which slows the traffic. In the current protein–ligand docking model, the slow traffic does not cause a problem; i.e., the simulation is able to predict the correct complex structure once the ligand reaches the ligand-binding site. In an all-atom treatment, however, the ligand may enter the binding site with a different orientation from that in the correct complex structure or may weakly bind with non-binding sites on the protein surface. Those non-native complexes should be dissociated as quickly as possible during the enhanced sampling. Therefore, the slow traffic may cause a serious problem in conformational sampling. To increase the statistical significance, the traffic should be increased. We survey the two-state AU sampling with the aim of more fully understanding a mechanism of the slowed-down traffic. The enhanced conformational sampling introduces the modified potential energy  E 
 mod  to control the probability distribution:  E 
 mod  =  E 
 u ( r ) and  E 
 mc ( r ) for the AU and multicanonical methods, respectively. The potential energy  E  is always zero in the present system. Therefore, the canonical ensemble assigns an equal probability to all accessible lattice points. The canonical distributions  P 
 c (State1) and  P 
 c (Other) are proportional, respectively, to  N 
 State1  and  N 
 Other . The modified potential energy  E 
 mod  is then given as 33 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

 mod  that originated from the entropy difference. As a general rule, in adequate enhanced sampling, the traffic slows down when the conformation traverses a boundary with a large change in entropy. It is noteworthy that coercive traffic enhancement might result in a non-equilibrated ensemble, particularly in the all-atom treatment with explicit solvent where deep pinholes characterized by small entropies are distributed throughout the conformational space. The coercive enhancement pushes the conformation into a pinhole in the vicinity of the current conformation before the conformation takes a long trip to visit a wide energy basin. Traffic enhancement Is there any prescription for enhancing the traffic solely by controlling the distribution function? We now introduce States 2–3 partitioned by boundaries (Fig.  4 ).

 We denote this AU sampling as ‘four-state AU sampling’ or simply ‘four-state sampling’. The simulation was performed with various sets of Boundaries 2 and 3 (i.e., various values of  L 
 2  and  L 
 3 ) to investigate the dependency of the traffic on the boundary positions. We fixed State 1 (binding cleft) and the Far region as in the two-state sampling for all simulations. This simulation was performed four times at each set of boundary positions, and each run was executed for 1 × 10 12  steps with the initial 10 8  steps being discarded to compute &lt; Δ N  &gt; . Figure  5  shows the dependence of &lt;Δ N  &gt; on the boundary set [ L 
 2 , L 
 3 ]. The probability was well controlled as  P 
 State i  = 25.00 ± 0.01%. The traffic was enhanced considerably for all boundaries examined. The smallest &lt; Δ N  &gt; (fastest traffic) was 5.21 × 10 5  steps at [ L 
 2 , L 
 3 ] = [10,60], where the traffic was about 50-fold faster than that from two-state sampling because the introduced states (States 2–4) loosened the large entropy change: | S 
 State i  –  S 
 State i +1 | &lt; &lt; | S 
 State1  –  S 
 Other |. The modified potential energy of this system is funnel-like (red line in Fig.  6 ), contrasting to the golf hole-like potential of the two-state sampling (black broken line in Fig.  6 ). We also plot  E 
 mod  for two other sets [ L 
 2 , L 
 3 ] = [5,15] (blue line) and [40,80] (green line) in Fig.  6 , for which &lt;Δ N &gt; was 9.45 × 10 5  and 24.1 × 10 5  steps, respectively. The former is more golf-hole-like than the red line, and the latter was more jar-like. Modulation of the boundaries to speed up the traffic is subtle—even for this simple sampling. We also examined simulations to produce uneven distributions ( g

 The introduction of the intermediate states, States 2–4, corresponds to the adoption of a reaction coordinate suitable for weakening the entropy gaps. Because the present system is extremely simple, its conformational space is also very simple. As a general rule, the choice of the reaction coordinate depends on the structure of the conformational space, and the structure remains unknown for most biological systems. It is also likely that the energy surface of a real biological system involves several low-energy basins, pinholes, and dead ends of conformational changes, which cause deep conformational trapping. Consequently, to define an effective reaction coordinate might be a difficult task for the realistic protein system. However, we generally note that the appropriate reaction coordinate drastically enhances the protein dynamics. For example, the tuning of  g (λ) (or  g ( E ) for multicanonical sampling) increases the sampling efficiency, as shown above. Then, starting with  g  = 1, we can detect values of λ or  E  at which the traffic slows. We can then modify  g  at the values. Actual procedure for multicanonical sampling To perform enhanced conformational sampling, one should define the modified potential energy,  E 
 mc ( E ) or  E 
 u ( r ), which involves the canonical distribution  P 
 c ( E , T ) (Eq.  30 ) or  P 
 c (λ, T ) (Eq.  20 ). This is self-contradictory because the canonical distribution is unknown in advance. To solve this problem, we iterate the simulation where the canonical distribution function gradually converges to the aimed function  g ( E ) or  g (λ). Below, we first explain practical procedures for multicanonical sampling and then explain those for the AU sampling. First, we mention the energy range [ E 
 low ,  E 
 up ] to be explored in the multicanonical simulation. From a general thermodynamic formula 1/ RT  =  d  ln  n ( E )/ dE , we obtain the following relation. 37 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

 Consequently, solving Eq.  37  is equivalent to evaluating the energy value [denoted as  E 
 P mx ( T )] at the maximum value of  P 
 c ( E , T ). To ensure quick structural relaxation in the multicanonical simulation, the upper limit  E 
 up  should correspond to a high temperature  T 
 up , at which the conformation overcomes high energy barriers. However, our biophysical interest is usually devoted to the conformations at room temperature ( T 
 room ). The lower energy limit  E 
 low  is therefore expected to correspond to a temperature  T 
 low  that is slightly lower than  T 
 room . For that reason, the energy range [ E 
 low , E 
 up ] is determined as 39 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

 When we initiate multicanonical simulation, this energy range is unknown because  E 
 P mx ( T ) is evaluated from  P 
 c ( E , T ), which is unknown in advance. In the iterative procedure explained below,  P 
 c ( E , T ) converges to an accurate function, following which the energy range is determined gradually. The iterative procedure used to evaluate  P 
 c ( E , T ) is as follows. A canonical simulation (denoted as ‘pre-run’) is first performed at  T 
 up  with setting  E 
 mc  =  E . This run produces a canonical energy distribution  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Actual procedure for AU sampling In multicanonical sampling, all microscopic states of the same energy  E  contribute evenly to  P 
 c ( E , T ). For this reason, the density of states  n ( E ) appears in the formulae (Eqs.  26  and  27 ). Although AU sampling has some similarity to multicanonical sampling,  n ( E ) does not appear in the former formulation because microscopic states of the same λ, which contribute to  P 
 c (λ, T ), have various energies. Therefore, the procedures for the AU sampling are somewhat different from those for multicanonical sampling. We denote the sampled range for λ as [λ low , λ up ], where the canonical distribution  P 
 c (λ, T ) should be determined accurately. If the structures at λ low  and λ up  belong to different stable states (different energy basins) at  T , then the sampling might provide possible pathways for the conformational changes between the states. To start with, a canonical run (again demoted as ‘pre-run’) is performed using the original potential energy at  T , which is usually an interesting temperature such as room temperature. In this run, we restrict the sampling in a range  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

 The second AU run is then performed at  T . The procedure is repeated until the sampling covers the intended range [λ low , λ up ]. The expansion of the sampling range and the simulation length should be determined carefully with progression of the iteration. Methods to update the canonical distribution In the methods described above, the modified potential energy is invariant during an iterative run, and the canonical distribution function  P 
 c ( q , T ), in which  q  =  E  or λ, is updated after completion of the iterative run. The  i -th run should be performed sufficiently long to generate  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Consequently, the simulation is categorized in equilibrium sampling when the initial relevant simulation conformation is prepared. We have designated this updating method as ‘the every-run update method’. An alternative means is to update  P 
 c  slightly at every step of the simulation. When the conformation is detected in a bin [ q ,  q  + Δ q ],  P 
 c  is modified by a small increment Δ q  as 52 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

 This method is called the Wang–Landau sampling for  q  =  E  (Wang and Landau  2001 ) and the metadynamics (Laio and Parrinello  2002 ) or the filling potential sampling method (Fukunishi et al.  2003 ) for  q  = λ. The increment Δ P 
 c  is usually positive and restricted in the detected bin or bins in the vicinity of the detected bin. When the sampling is based on MD, Δ P 
 c  should be differentiable with respect to  q . The modified potential energy is modified at every simulation step. Therefore, this simulation is categorized in non-equilibrium sampling independently of the initial simulation conformation. During the simulation, the conformation feels a repulsive force to escape from bins that have been visited. With progress of the simulation, increment Δ P 
 c  decreases gradually, ultimately vanishing: Δ P 
 c  → 0. One expects convergence of   P 
 c  to the accurate distribution function at this final stage. We designate this updating method as ‘the every-step update method’. The benefit of the every-step update is its ease of automation: Once the protocol for setting Δ P 
 c  is determined, one can perform the simulation without manual operations until Δ P 
 c  vanishes. However, the conformational space of a large biological system is vast, within which numerous energy basins, pinholes, and energy barriers can be distributed. In this case, the emerging repulsive force might push the conformations within a local region of the conformational space before the conformation fluctuates toward vast regions that have not yet been visited. In other words, the conformation wanders among a small number of basins/pinholes without overcoming energy barriers to visit the new regions. To avoid this delicate problem, a force-biased multicanonical sampling (Kim et al.  2004 ) has been proposed. In this method, the modified potential energy is maintained for a long interval of the simulation, during which Δ P 
 c  is summed up ( \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

 c  at every time step. Then, after executing the interval, Δ P 
 sum  is added to  P 
 c . This method is categorized in the equilibrated sampling in each interval. We designate this updating method as ‘the every-interval update method’. If the interval length is sufficiently long, then the method is substantially equivalent to the every-run update. However, if the interval is short, this method reaches the every-step update. The benefit of the every-interval update is its ease of automation, where the setting of the interval length controls the entire sampling process. All of these methods target the accurate estimation of the canonical distribution  P 
 c ( q , T ). Consequently, a long final run (production or sampling run) is required while using the converged canonical distribution without another update. This additional procedure is important for checking whether the converged distribution can produce the aimed distribution  g ( q ) [usually  g ( q ) = 1)] Coincidentally, the sampled conformations from the production run are used for analyses. A conventional MD (canonical MD) at a temperature provides a canonical energy distribution,  P 
 c ( E , T ), which is accurate only in a narrow energy range, from which a partially accurate density of states  n ( E ) is obtained. Terada et al. ( 2003 ) performed several canonical MD runs at different temperatures, obtained the fractions of  n ( E ), and constructed the entire density of states by integrating the fractions. When the computed system is small, the constructed  n ( E ) is useful for the production run of multicanonical simulation without the iterative procedure. With increasing system size, however, the accuracy of the constructed  n ( E ) decreases because a canonical run at a temperature sample only involves a restricted region of the conformational space. However, this method provides the first approximation of  n ( E ), which can be refined via iterative multicanonical runs. TTP-multicanonical sampling The methods described above guarantee that the accuracy of  P 
 c ( q , T ) increases concomitantly with increased simulation length. However, the volume of the conformational space increases rapidly with increased system size (Eq.  1 ), while the moving speed of the conformation in the conformational space remains almost unchanged despite the system size. Consequently, equilibration becomes unachievable in an actual computational time with increased system size. Trajectory-parallelization methods have recently been developed for use in the multicanonical simulation of a large system in which many runs are performed, starting from various initial conformations (Higo et al.  2009 ; Sugihara et al.  2009 ). In the trivial trajectory-parallelization multicanonical molecular dynamics (TTP-McMD), the multiple trajectories are simply connected, where each trajectory might be short. Importantly, the integrated long trajectory can be regarded theoretically as a single simulation trajectory because the detailed balance is satisfied at the inter-trajectory connection points (Ikebe et al.  2011a ). Because the initial conformations spread in the conformational space in advance, the sampled space is wider than that by the single multicanonical simulation, even though the length of the integrated trajectory is equal to or shorter than the single simulation trajectory (Fig.  8 ). To substantialize the wide sampling, trajectory parallelization is done from the pre-run stage, where the conformations are randomized in the high-energy region. The next multiple runs (first multicanonical runs) are then initiated from the last snapshots of the pre-runs, and so on. This method has been used for the coupled folding and binding of an intrinsically disordered protein (Higo et al.  2011 ).

 Parallel computing to speed up a single run by a number of computing nodes is effective when the time development of the system is of interest. In multicanonical sampling (and in any of the generalized ensemble methods) the simulation trajectory does not provide realistic time development of the system. The purpose of multicanonical sampling is to obtain the conformational ensemble. To increase the statistics of the ensemble,  N  runs should be executed when there are  N  computing nodes. In fact, the computing nodes do not communicate during the simulation. In other words, the parallelization efficiency is always 100% in the TTP method. Other computational techniques The enhanced sampling methods explained in this review are those that control the sampling by a 1D distribution  P 
 c ( q , T ). This can be extended naturally to a multi-dimensional version where  P 
 c ( q 
 1 ,  q 
 2 , …;  T ) controls the sampling. Some 2D versions have already been proposed (Higo et al.  1997 ; Iba et al.  1998 ; Nakajima  1998 ; Okumura and Okamoto  2004 ), such as multi-dimensional AU sampling (Bartels and Karplus  1997 ), multi-dimensional replica exchange (Sugita et al.  2000 ), and multi-dimensional AU/multicanonical sampling (Zheng et al.  2008 ). If the sampling is performed for a sufficiently long period to determine  P 
 c ( q 
 1 ,  q 
 2 ,  T ) accurately, then the generated conformational ensemble provides more information than the 1D distribution. We now introduce two computational techniques: the mass-scaling and puddle-skimming methods. Although these methods are not categorized in the generalized ensemble method, they can be combined to the AU or multicanonical sampling. In the mass-scaling method, atomic masses are varied to speed up the sampling. Feenstra et al. ( 1999 ) scaled up the mass of hydrogen atoms in a system and increased the time step Δ t  to integrate the Newtonian equations because fast motions related to the hydrogen atoms are slowed by mass scaling. In contrast, Gee and van Gunsteren ( 2006 ) scaled down the masses of the solvent atoms, with the result that the viscosity decreased and the peptide moved quickly. One might point out that the system kinetics changes through mass scaling, suggesting that this method is less useful for tracing the time series of the system motions. However, the equilibrated distribution converges to the canonical ensemble (i.e., after a long simulation) irrespective of the unrealistic kinetics. Mass-scaling can help the generalized ensemble method to speed up the sampling. A protein is a long polypeptide chain in which the atoms are connected by covalent bonds. Therefore, once the chain has misfolded during a simulation, the structure should unfold to restart the folding. In the puddle-skimming method, energy that is higher than a given value  E 
 b  is reset to  E 
 b  (Steiner et al.  1998 ; Rahman and Tully  2002a ,  b ). When  E 
 b  is set to a high value, conformations with energies larger than  E 
 b  do not influence the equilibrated ensemble at room temperature. This method might allow self-overlapping of the polypeptide chain, i.e., misfolded structure refolds without unfolding. A simplified protein model has shown that the self-overlapping considerably enhances the structure relaxation when the overlap is controlled well (Iba et al.  1998 ). Free-energy landscape The enhanced conformational sampling is used for constructing the free-energy landscape. The free-energy landscape visualizes conformational clusters (low free-energy basins) and inter-cluster pathways. The free energy assigned to cluster  i  is defined as  F 
 i  = −  RT 
 a  ln[ N 
 i ], where  N 
 i  is the number of conformations involved in the cluster and  T 
 a  is the temperature at which the conformational ensemble is obtained (detail is described later). Therefore, the largest cluster (i.e., the cluster involving the most conformations) has the lowest free energy, and the free-energy difference between clusters  i  and  j  is calculated as Δ F  =  F 
 j  –  F 
 i  = −  RT 
 a  ln[ N 
 j  /  N 
 i ]. When a conformational distribution  P ( q 
 1 , q 
 2 ,…) is computed from the ensemble, where the set of parameters [ q 
 1 , q 
 2 ,…] specifies a position in the conformational space, the free-energy map is defined as  F ( q 
 1 , q 
 2 ,…) = −  RT 
 a  ln[ P ( q 
 1 , q 
 2 ,…)]. In the map, a cluster corresponds to a low free-energy region, and free-energy barriers are identified among the low free-energy regions. In multicanonical sampling, the entire conformational ensemble, denoted as  Q 
 all , is characterized by a wide energy distribution. A canonical conformational ensemble  Q 
 c ( T 
 a ) at temperature  T 
 a  is generated as follows: first, we pick a conformation from  Q 
 all , for which energy is denoted as  E 
 pic , and assign a probability  P 
 c ( E 
 pic , T 
 a ) to the selected conformation as 53 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

 c ( E , T 
 a ). If  p 
 c ( E 
 pic , T 
 a ) is larger than a random number distributed uniformly in [0,1], then the chosen conformation is registered in  Q 
 c ( T 
 a ). Repeating this procedure for all conformations in  Q 
 all , the ensemble  Q 
 c ( T 
 a ) is generated. The most biophysically interesting ensemble is usually that at room temperature:  Q 
 c ( T 
 room ). We can generate a visible free-energy landscape by projecting the structures in  Q 
 c ( T 
 room ) onto a low-dimensional conformational space. The low-dimensional space might be constructed by overall structural identifiers, such as the radius of gyration, solvent accessible surface area, or root mean square deviation measured from a given structure, or by abstract coordinate axes derived from principal component analysis (PCA). Ono et al. ( 1999 ) constructed a fine free-energy landscape for the  cis / trans- imide isomerization of a peptide dimer, –Ala–Pro–. The TTP-McMD produces short trajectories, and a long trajectory is generated connecting the short trajectories. Since the long trajectory can be regarded as a single multicanonical trajectory, the snapshots recorded in the long trajectory construct the entire conformational ensemble  Q 
 all . The distribution  P 
 c ( E , T 
 a ) is also computed from the long trajectory and then the ensemble  Q 
 c ( T 
 a ) is computed with the method explained above. We note a disadvantage of the overall structural identifiers to generate the free-energy landscape: widely different protein tertiary structures can have the same value as the structural identifier. This structural ambiguity leads to a misleading interpretation of a free-energy barrier. We experienced that free-energy barriers identified in the PCA space completely vanish in the space constructed by the overall structural identifiers (Kamiya et al.  2002 ; Higo et al.  2011 ). All-atom McMD simulations of various systems Lastly in this paper, we describe our all-atom McMD studies of various biophysical systems. In these studies, we gradually increased the system size to be sampled and determined that at the present time the McMD method is applicable to the 57-residue system. We first applied McMD to a two-residue peptide and produced a free-energy landscape in which possible conformations were identified as clusters (Nakajima et al.  2000 ). The clusters were separated by free-energy barriers and might be bridged by free-energy pathways. This work revealed that McMD is useful to study biological systems.A seven-residue peptide (DNA-binding segment of a DNA binding protein) was subsequently solved (Higo et al.  2001b ). Although this segment adopts a helix in the protein framework, it is disordered in the isolated state. We have shown that the free-energy landscape consists of various secondary structures, such as helices, hairpins, and other disordered conformations. It is particularly interesting that a cluster was found whose structure is the same as that in the protein framework. A similar result was obtained in McMD simulations of a nine-residue segment taken from a distal β-hairpin of a SH3 domain (Ikeda et al.  2003 ). These results suggest that the segment structure in the protein framework is metastable, even in the disordered state. The McMD simulations of a seven-residue β segment (Higo et al.  2001a ; Kamiya et al.  2002 ) revealed that three β-hairpin clusters exist in the free-energy landscape and that each cluster is characterized by a different number of inter-strand hydrogen bonds. Therefore, hydrogen bond formation accompanies a jump in a free-energy barrier. A similar result was obtained in the work described above (Higo et al.  2001b ). The McMD simulation of a 16-residue chameleon sequence (a part of DNA binding protein) showed that this sequence has a strong propensity to fold into α-helix or β-hairpin, each of which correlated well with the experimentally determined polytypic structures (Ikeda and Higo  2003 ). The free-energy landscape visualized probable pathways for conformational changes between the α and β structures, suggesting that the actually selected structure (α or β) is determined by an interaction between the DNA-binding protein and DNA. We then proceeded to longer peptides, which might exist as a single chain state without a protein framework. The McMD simulation of a 25-residue segment from the Alzheimer's β amyloid peptide (Aβ) in a TFE/water co-solvent showed that this peptide folds into the experimentally determined helical structure (Kamiya et al.  2007 ), although it is disordered in water (Ikebe et al.  2007a ). The free-energy landscape was funnel-like above 325 K, where the funnel bottom corresponded to the experimental structure, and the landscape transitioned abruptly to a rugged one below 325 K. This work might have captured a general property of the temperature-induced structural transition exhibited by many peptides/proteins. The effect of solvent on the polypeptide conformation is an interesting issue in biophysics. A 24-residue peptide, humanin, is disordered in water and adopts a helical structure in the TFE/water co-solvent. We performed McMD simulations of this peptide in both solvents (Yagisawa et al.  2008 ). The results obtained showed good agreement with the experiment in which we discussed details of the interactions among the peptide, TFE, and water. McMD simulation of a 40-residue protein, the C-terminal domain of H-NS, in explicit water has also ben performed (Ikebe et al.  2007b ). This small protein consists of α and β secondary-structure elements in the native structure. The obtained conformational ensemble involved a small cluster, which corresponded to the native structure, and a large cluster, where half of the protein (helical region) folded well to the native structure but the other half (β region) adopted a distorted β-hairpin. Analyses showed that the two regions were incorrectly packed together. The analyses also suggested that the force field might not be sufficiently accurate. Nevertheless, the existence of the small native-like cluster was encouraging because the McMD approach proved to be powerful for the protein. It is likely that the small cluster grows as the largest cluster if an accurate force field is used. Based on those studies, we proceeded to a 57-residue protein, the first repeat of human glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (EPRS-R1), surrounded by an explicit solvent (Ikebe et al.  2011b ). This protein comprises two long helices adopting a helix–hairpin fold in its native NMR structure (Jeong et al.  2000 ). The force field was set carefully so that it prefers either a α or β secondary structure depending on the sequence (Kamiya et al.  2005 ), although EPRS-R1 is the helical protein. Starting from a fully extended conformation, the McMD simulation produced conformational ensembles at several temperatures. The protein was disordered at a high temperature (600 K for instance). In contrast, the ensemble at 300 K was characterized by two helical regions, which corresponded to those observed in the NMR structure. This room temperature ensemble was subjected to a structure clustering, resulting in 20 clusters. Importantly, the largest cluster (lowest free-energy cluster) showed the most native-like structure of all clusters. Subsequent analyses revealed that the hydrophobic core formation between the two helical regions drives the conformation toward the native fold with exclusion of water molecules from the protein interior. The McMD simulation was used to study protein–ligand flexible docking. The first application was done on the binding of a short proline-rich peptide to a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain (Nakajima et al.  1997a ). Although the protein and ligand were put into a vacuum, a conformational cluster corresponded to the native complex. In the flexible docking of lysozyme and its inhibitor in explicit solvent, a number of different clusters were obtained (Kamiya et al.  2008 ). Importantly, the largest cluster (lowest free-energy cluster) corresponded to the native complex form, and the native cluster was discriminated from the other minor clusters by a free-energy barrier. The McMD simulation was applied on an IDP system consisting of a 15-residue IDP segment (NRSF/REST) and its receptor protein mSin3 (Higo et al.  2011 ). Its native complex structure was resolved through an nuclear magnetic resonance experiment in which NRSF/REST adopts a helix when it binds to the deep binding cleft of mSin3 (Nomura et al.  2005 ). Starting from a conformation where NRSF/REST was disordered and apart from the receptor in explicit solvent, an ensemble at 300 K was obtained. The free-energy landscape revealed that NRSF/REST can bind to mSin3, adopting various conformations, with cluster analysis showing that the largest is the native-complex cluster. The other minor clusters are non-native ones. In the non-native clusters, NRSF/REST adopts bent or extended structures in the binding cleft of mSin3, with some of these adopting the opposite orientation against NRSF/REST in the native complex. The free-energy landscape exhibited two free-energy barriers. Analyses have shown that NRSF/REST changes the chain orientation or the end-to-end distance to overcome free-energy barriers. Additional McMD simulations of single-chain NRSF/REST have revealed that NRSF/REST is disordered in solution and that the various conformations in the complex state also appear in this free state. Therefore, NRSF/REST is highly flexible in both the complex and free states. We have proposed a mechanism for this system in which the coupled folding and binding is achieved through coupling of the population shift (Bosshard  2001 ; Yamane et al.  2010 ) and induced folding (Monod et al.  1965 ; Spolar and Record  1994 ). Conclusion  With the rapidly increasing capabilities of computers, the study of the conformational sampling of large biological systems is becoming important. In this context, the enhancement of sampling is of crucial importance in the exploration of the energy surface with statistical significance,. In this article, we have explained the methodology of multicanonical and AU sampling methods, which are categorized in generalized ensemble methods. These methods directly control the probability distribution and indirectly control the transition probability (rate constant) among different states. Studies of various biophysical systems, expressed as all-atom models, were reported here. The results show that enhanced sampling might slow the large motions of the system, even when the enhancement is performed fairly, because the entropy largely varies at a position of the reaction coordinate. We have demonstrated that the loosening of the large entropy change drastically enhances the sampling. </Body>

    <Abstact>The development of advanced experimental methodologies, such as optical tweezers, scanning-probe and super-resolved optical microscopies, has led to the evolution of single-molecule biophysics, a field of science that allows direct access to the mechanistic detail of biomolecular structure and function. The extension of single-molecule methods to the investigation of particles such as viruses permits unprecedented insights into the behavior of supramolecular assemblies. Here we address the scope of viral exploration at the level of individual particles. In an era of increased awareness towards virology, single-particle approaches are expected to facilitate the in-depth understanding, and hence combating, of viral diseases.</Abstact>
    <Body>Single-molecule and single-particle science Much of our knowledge in natural sciences is derived from ensembles of particles (atoms, molecules), the standard quantity of which is the mol (Van Holde et al.  1998 ). The properties and the behavior of the individual particles are thus extrapolations from ensemble average parameters. By contrast, single-molecule and single-particle science focuses on the individual (Bustamante et al.  2000 ; Kellermayer  2005 ). Hence, not only the average but also the distribution of the measured parameter can be obtained, which provides a direct insight into the structure, function, and dynamics of the investigated molecule or particle and into the mechanisms behind the processes the molecule or the particle is involved in. Investigation of molecules and particles one by one has particular significance in biological systems, considering that in a living cell often there are only a handful of molecules of the same species present. Although particles, in the biological sense, are usually supramolecular assemblies and therefore are composed of a number of molecules, similar methodological principles can be applied to them as to single molecules. There are at least four areas in which single-molecule or single-particle techniques provide unique gain over ensemble methods. First, individuals can be identified in a crowd and followed in space and time. Considering the unusually dense and crowded environment of the intracellular space, single-molecule and single-particle visualization methods must be applied to uncover the behavior of individual molecular species. Second, the temporal distribution of molecular states may be described; hence stochastic processes, such as the blinking of fluorescent proteins (Dickson et al.  1997 ), may be identified. Third, the spatial distribution of molecular states may be identified; hence, processes that proceed via parallel pathways, such as protein folding (Dobson and Karplus  1999 ; Zhuang and Rief  2003 ), may be explored in detail. Finally, the mechanical properties and functions of biomolecular systems can be unveiled only by single-molecule and single-particle methods, because mechanical force needs to be measured which is a vectorial quantity with a distinct point of action. Biomolecular mechanics entail the investigation of the elastic and viscoelastic properties of biomolecules and the force-generation by mechanoenzymes. The field of single-molecule and single-particle science evolved in the past 30 years through landmark experiments. Individual actin filaments could be visualized as they glide over a lawn of myosin molecules in what has since become known as the in vitro motility assay (Harada et al.  1987 ; Kron and Spudich  1986 ). Myosin (Finer et al.  1994 ) and kinesin (Svoboda et al.  1993 ) were the first motor proteins, the mechanical work (force and displacement) of which were measured, by using optical tweezers. Single-molecule mechanical experiments have shown that dsDNA may be overstretched into an S-form, the exact nature of which is still to be uncovered (Smith et al.  1996 ; Strick et al.  1996 ). The first protein molecule to be mechanically manipulated, with optical tweezers (Kellermayer et al.  1997 ; Tskhovrebova et al.  1997 ) and AFM (Rief et al.  1997a ), was the giant muscle protein titin. This mechanical fingerprinting assay has since contributed to the development of a separate methodological field, single-molecule force spectroscopy (Anderson et al.  2013 ; Dowhan et al.  2015 ; Fisher et al.  2000 ; Greene et al.  2008 ; Lanzicher et al.  2020 ; Lv et al.  2014 ; Rief and Grubmuller  2002 ; Rief et al.  1997b ; Ros et al.  2004 ; Thoma et al.  2018 ; Zhu et al.  2009 ). Stretching single RNA hairpins with optical tweezers has shown that RNA can fold against force (Liphardt et al.  2001 ). It has also been shown that ribosomes are mechanoenzymes that work against applied force via phases of discrete steps and pauses (Wen et al.  2008 ). Single-particle approaches have been applied to viruses soon after AFM imaging began making its way into biomolecular sciences. The topography of individual T4 bacteriophage particles was obtained by scanning them, in air, with the AFM (Ikai et al.  1993 ). Single-molecule mechanical experiments revealed that the portal motor of the φ29 bacteriophage is the strongest mechanoenzyme known to date (Smith et al.  2001 ) (see also below). AFM-based nanoindentation experiments revealed that viral capsids are resilient nanocontainers (Ivanovska et al.  2007 ; Ivanovska et al.  2004 ; Klug et al.  2006 ; Michel et al.  2006 ; Roos et al.  2007 ). The single-particle approach to understanding viral structure, function, and mechanics paved the way towards the emergence of physical virology (Baclayon et al.  2010 ; Marchetti et al.  2016 ; Roos et al.  2010 ). In the following we address some of the pivotal aspects of the single-particle applications in virus analysis, which may be appropriately called  single-particle virology . It is important to note that in spite of the amazing progress in the cryo-electron microscopic investigation of viruses, cryo-EM is not discussed here as it relies on class averaging of particle images obtained on frozen virions (Kaelber et al.  2017 ). By contrast, in single-particle virology, individual virions are studied in their quasi-native, functional environment. General structure and life cycle of viruses The history of virology dates back to the end of the eighteenth century to Edward Jenner’s valiant experiment, which is the first vaccination effort, against smallpox, a highly contagious viral infection (Riedel  2005 ). The remarkable experiment notwithstanding, the existence of viruses remained unknown for several decades. Although the discovery of the Tobacco mosaic virus by D. Ivanovski (1892) and M. Beijerinck (1898) and bacteriophages by F. W. Twort (1915) and F. d’Herelle (1917) had given experimental evidence for the existence of infectious agents smaller than bacteria (Duckworth  1976 ), viruses could be visualized only much later, with the introduction of the electron microscope (EM) in 1939 (Goldsmith and Miller  2009 ). At present, about 80 years after the first visible record of Tobbaco mosaic viruses by EM (Kausche et al.  1939 ), single-particle methods enable us not only to visualize individual virions but also to study environmental effects such as changes in pH (Wilts et al.  2015 ), temperature (Vörös et al.  2018 ), or osmotic pressure (Cordova et al.  2003 ; Evilevitch et al.  2005 ; Evilevitch et al.  2003 ; Jeembaeva et al.  2008 ) on capsids in real time in quasi physiological aqueous conditions. Viruses are small obligate intracellular parasites (Gelderblom  1996 ). They are classified on the basis of morphology, chemical composition, and mode of replication. The complete virus particle is composed of either RNA or DNA genome—single stranded or double stranded, linear or circular—packaged inside a symmetric protein capsid. The entire genome may be formed by a single nucleic acid molecule (monopartite genome) or segments of it (multipartite genome). The different types of genomes lead to different replication strategies. Capsids are formed as single- or double-layered protein shells and consist of only one or a few structural protein species (Lucas  2010 ). Self-assembly of virus capsids follows two basic patterns: helical symmetry, in which nucleocapsids consist of a helical array of proteins wrapped around a helical filament of nucleic acid, or icosahedral symmetry, in which the protein subunits assemble into a symmetric shell that covers the nucleic acid–containing core. Icosahedral viral capsids need to withstand the high pressure from the tightly packaged DNA. Larger viruses often have a complex architecture consisting of both helical and isometric symmetries confined to different structural components. In enveloped viruses, the nucleocapsid is surrounded by a lipid bilayer derived from the modified host cell membrane decorated with virus envelope glycoproteins. Virus envelopes can be considered additional protective shells. A head-tail morphology is unique to viruses that infect bacteria, which are known as bacteriophages. The head of the virus has an icosahedral shape connected to a helical tail (Hrebík et al.  2019 ). The phage tail is attached to one of the fivefold vertices of the head in which a pentamer of capsid proteins is replaced by a dodecahedral portal complex. The tails of podoviruses are variable in size and protein composition; however, they share common organizational motifs. The capsids of some phages contain inner core proteins that are associated with the portal complex and play a role during infection. The capsid and envelope protect the viral genome from digestion by nucleases, maintain virion integrity, and play a role in viral infection: they facilitate virus attachment to target cells, the entry into the host, the release of its contents into the cells, and the enclosure of the newly formed viral genome (Roos et al.  2007 ). Capsid and envelope structure determine the method of viral binding, entry, and exit through the host cell membrane. The tail of bacteriophages contains specialized protein subunits for receptor binding, cell wall degradation, and cell membrane penetration (Lander et al.  2009 ). The inner core proteins are released together with the phage genome and are speculated to play a role in the delivery of DNA into the cell cytoplasm. Packaging of viral genomes of tailed bacteriophages inside procapsids is powered by an ATP-dependent virus-encoded genome-packaging motor that assembles at the portal vertex (Cardone et al.  2012 ; Lokareddy et al.  2017 ; Rao and Feiss  2008 ; Suhanovsky and Teschke  2015 ). Packaging of the viral genome An essential, first step of the viral life cycle is the tight packaging of newly replicated viral genome into a protein shell, which leads to the emergence of new, infectious virions. Several double-stranded (ds) DNA viruses, including herpes, adenoviruses, and tailed bacteriophages, package their genome into preformed protein procapsids by a nanomotor that is located at its portal complex (Casjens  2011 ; Rao and Feiss  2008 ). This molecular motor is an ATP-hydrolyzing DNA translocase which requires chemical energy to condense the typically several-micrometer-long double-stranded DNA into the capsid-confined volume that is approximately 10 −4  μm 3  (Sun et al.  2010 ). In the case of tailed bacteriophages, the diameter of the capsid (30–100 nm) is typically five to six orders of magnitude smaller than the contour length of the viral DNA (3–10 μm), which explains why packaging results in a tightly wound arrangement and near-crystalline DNA density (Tang et al.  2008 ). To package the highly charged polymer chain into a small confinement, the motor protein has to deliver a significant amount of mechanical work to overcome the increase in entropic, electrostatic, and bending energies of the condensed DNA (Jeembaeva et al.  2010 ; Tzlil et al.  2003 ). Single-molecule experiments revealed the nanomechanics of the viral packaging machine, in which the terminus of a partially packaged dsDNA molecule was pulled against the working packaging motor using optical tweezers. In case of the most excessively studied ϕ29 bacteriophage, these measurements revealed that the DNA-packaging motor is processive, can insert DNA into the procapsid at rates of ∼ 100 bp per second, and generates forces up to ∼ 60 piconewtons (Fig.  1 ) (Smith et al.  2001 ). The unprecedented high value of forces that single viral packaging motors were able to exert in these experiments makes them the strongest molecular motors reported to date. The speed of packaging decreased with the procapsid filling, possibly because of the increasing internal pressure. This suggests that the high forces generated by the motor are required to package DNA against the increasing internal capsid pressure that can reach up to ∼ 6 MPa by the end of the process (Evilevitch et al.  2003 ). The ϕ29 motor translocates the DNA in steps of 10 bps that in turn consists of four rapid, non-integer 2.5-bp sub-steps per ATP hydrolysis (Moffitt et al.  2009 ). The four non-integer steps together with the presence of five motor subunits reveals an asymmetry that demands new models for motor-DNA interactions (Chistol et al.  2012 ). It has been shown that the ϕ29 motor also rotates the DNA during packaging, and the rotation per base pair increases with filling and leads to a reduction in the motor’s step size as the level of packaging increases (Liu et al.  2014 ). The packaging of T4 and λ phages measured with optical tweezers was also found to be driven by a very strong (stall force &gt; 60 pN) and processive motor, suggesting that these are universal properties of all dsDNA viral motors that need to package DNA to high density. The only difference that was found in case of T4 and λ motors is that the packaging rates were significantly faster (1–2 kbp per second). Given that the genome of T4 and λ phages is several-fold longer than that of ϕ29, these findings suggest that viral motors scale their packaging speeds according to the genome size (Fuller et al.  2007a ; Fuller et al.  2007b ). Fig. 1 Schematics of measuring the mechanical function of the φ29 bacteriophage portal motor (Smith et al.  2001 ). The force generated by the DNA-packaging portal motor is transmitted, via the dsDNA molecule, to an optically trapped latex bead attached to the free DNA end, allowing for the measurement of the force. This particular packaging motor stalls at a force of about 60 pN Topographical structure of individual virus particles Viruses assemble spontaneously from their proteinaceous building blocks into a few main structural classes with a variety of sizes and molecular detail. In recent years cryo-electron microscopy has become a key method in revealing viral structure, down to the atomic resolution (Kaelber et al.  2017 ). However, beyond doubt, the most essential method in investigating the structure of individual viral particles under ambient conditions is the atomic force microscope (AFM) (Allison et al.  2010 ; Baclayon et al.  2010 ; de Pablo  2018 ; de Pablo and Schaap  2019 ; Kuznetsov and McPherson  2011 ; Santos and Castanho  2004 ). Shortly after its invention (Binnig et al.  1986 ), AFM was applied to imaging viruses, initially in air (Ikai et al.  1993 ; Valle et al.  1996 ), then under aqueous buffer conditions (Müller et al.  1997 ; Ohnesorge et al.  1997 ). In the decade that followed, AFM has been applied to describing the surface structure of a vast array of different viruses (Chen  2007a ,  b ; Drygin et al.  1998 ; Dubrovin et al.  2007 ; Ferreira et al.  2008 ; Hards et al.  2005 ; Huff et al.  2004 ; Kiselyova et al.  2003 ; Klem et al.  2003 ; Kuznetsov et al.  2008 ; Kuznetsov et al.  2005a ; Kuznetsov et al.  2005b ; Kuznetsov et al.  2004 ; Kuznetsov et al.  2000 ; Kuznetsov et al.  2007 ; Malkin et al.  1999 ; Malkin et al.  2003 ; Mat-Arip et al.  2001 ; Matsko et al.  2001 ; Moloney et al.  2002 ; Negishi et al.  2004 ; Nettikadan et al.  2003 ; Schmatulla et al.  2006 ; Trindade et al.  2007 ). Although in its standard operation the AFM provides a high-resolution topographical image of the sample, by now its applications have expanded to nanomechanics, nanomanipulation, measurement of interactions, and recording of time-dependent processes. In an AFM the sample is scanned with a sharp tip at the end of a flexible cantilever. During scanning the tip is brought in close proximity with the surface that causes the cantilever to bend (de Pablo  2018 ). The bending of the cantilever, exerted by the forces acting between the tip and the surface, is detected through the deflection of a laser beam reflected from the back of the cantilever (de Pablo and Schaap  2019 ). Usually deflection is kept stable by a feedback loop, meaning that it is held at constant distance from the sample (de Pablo and Schaap  2019 ). A commonly used gentle imaging mode of soft biological samples is “tapping” or “amplitude-modulation” mode, in which the direct contact between the tip and the sample is minimized (Kuznetsov and McPherson  2011 ) (Fig.  2 ). Resonating the cantilever tip without shaking the entire cantilever base, such as in photothermal excitation, for example, provides a particularly stable imaging technique. Besides height contrast (Fig.  2 a, c), additional contrast mechanisms (e.g., amplitude, phase) provide further insight into local structural and mechanical (elasticity, viscosity) properties of the virion. Considering that each pixel of a height-contrast image contains topographical height information, height profile plots may be obtained along axial (Fig.  2 b) or arbitrary (Fig.  2 d) directions over the capsid surface. It is important to emphasize that the surface topographical image obtained after scanning the sample is not an ensemble average but is characteristic of the individual virion. In spite of collecting an image based on a single nanoscale object, amazing structural detail can be revealed ( c.f.  the tail fiber domain structure in Fig.  2 c). An AFM imaging mode that has become popular in viral analysis is “jumping mode” or fast force mapping (FFM) (Fig.  3 ). In FFM imaging the cantilever is moved up and down (sinusoidally) with a frequency (~ 50–300 Hz) much below the cantilever’s resonance frequency. There is one oscillation cycle for every pixel of the image. In each oscillation cycle a force versus distance plot is obtained which corresponds to a nanoindentation-retraction trial (Fig.  3 b). In FFM mode the forces which the virion is exposed to are better controlled than in tapping mode. Furthermore, topography, adhesion, and elasticity maps may be calculated from the force traces. Finally, resonant modes which a functional virus might respond to (Kellermayer et al.  2018 ) are avoided. Altogether, the functions of AFM provide much more than surface topography. High-resolution force versus distance curves derived from indentation and pulling experiments give information about the detailed nanomechanical properties of capsids (Marchetti et al.  2016 ) (see below). The Young’s modulus, stiffness, and rupture forces are directly associated with capsid stability (de Pablo  2018 ). Combining AFM imaging with nanoindentation allows to map the structural consequences of the mechanical perturbations. By utilizing this approach, the mechanical fatigue, the self-healing capacity, and the mechanically induced partial disassembly of capsids could be uncovered (Ortega-Esteban et al.  2013 ; Valbuena and Mateu  2015 ). Enveloped viruses such as HIV (Rankovic et al.  2017 ) and SARS-CoV (Lin et al.  2005 ) may be more challenging to investigate with AFM due to the dynamics of the surface coating. In the case of isolated HIV-1, it was found that the viral uncoating process depends on the stage of reverse transcription (Rankovic et al.  2017 ). Fig. 2 Imaging virions with atomic force microscopy (AFM) in non-contact mode, by using photothermal excitation to resonate the cantilever.  a  Height-contrast AFM image of a T7 bacteriophage particle attached to poly- l -lysine-coated mica. Based on the surface topography, this icosahedral virion is facing towards the buffer solution (phosphate-buffered saline, PBS) with its 3-fold symmetry axis.

Hence, virus-cell interactions, viral budding or disassembly can be followed in an unlabeled environment (Baclayon et al.  2010 ; Kiselyova et al.  2003 ). SARS-CoV virions were shown to bud and rupture the plasma membrane, assisted by the underlying actin cytoskeleton in their transport. Individual retrovirus budding through the plasma membrane of living cells infected with Moloney murine leukemia virus was monitored in real time with AFM, wherein two kinetically distinct pathways were observed (Gladnikoff and Rousso  2008 ). HIV budding was registered over time by measuring the viral protrusion height on the surface of infected cell membranes (Gladnikoff et al.  2009 ). Finally, thanks to the rapid development of image processing, automatic classification methods for single virus discrimination based on AFM imaging can be constructed, which might potentially be important in diagnostic applications. Blocklitz el al. investigated the maximal height, volume, and occupied area of five different virus species (Varicella-zoster virus, Porcine teschovirus, Tobacco mosaic virus, Coliphage M13, and Enterobacteria phage PsP3) on AFM images, and designed an automatic image classification method with an identification accuracy over 95% (Bocklitz et al.  2014 ). Viral capsid nanomechanics Besides being a powerful imaging technique, AFM also provides a possibility for exploring the mechanical properties of viral capsids. In the recent past, single-particle nanoindentation experiments enabled the characterization of the physical properties of viral capsids with unprecedented detail and insight (Carrasco et al.  2011 ; Castellanos et al.  2012 ; Hernando-Pérez et al.  2014b ; Ivanovska et al.  2011 ; Roos et al.  2012 ; Snijder et al.  2012 ). In a nanoindentation experiment, the tip of the AFM cantilever is lowered on the surface of a substrate-bound capsid until a pre-adjusted force is reached by the bending of the cantilever (Fig.  4 a). Then, the cantilever is retracted. Force, obtained from the bending of the calibrated cantilever, is recorded as a function of cantilever displacement (Fig.  4 b). Nanoindentation results showed that many virus protein capsids behave like elastic and robust nanocontainers (Snijder et al.  2013 ). Furthermore, below a certain force threshold, the capsids behave as elastic nanoshells, whereas at higher forces material failure occurs and the capsid collapses. The AFM has also been used to apply well-controlled forces to single capsids to trigger disintegration. For adenovirus, tip penetration causes the same sequence of events as the uncoating in vivo, starting with the release of pentons, followed by capsid disruption (Ortega-Esteban et al.  2015 ; Ortega-Esteban et al.  2013 ). Based on AFM imaging subsequent to the nanoindentation experiment, it was found that after the mechanical rupture of the capsid the viral core of a mutant adenovirus (TS1) remained visible as a condensed blob, whereas the core of the wild-type virus could not be resolved. AFM and single-molecule fluorescence microscopy were combined to specifically observe genome uncoating from wild-type and TS1 adenovirus (Cordova et al.  2014 ). Viruses that infect eukaryotic cells usually undergo structural changes leading to complete capsid disassembly and release of the viral genome (Mateu  2011 ; Wilts et al.  2015 ). Conformational transitions in the capsid can be triggered by mechanical cues. HIV-1 undergoes a protease-mediated maturation process, which is necessary for successful infection. By using AFM, it was discovered that HIV undergoes a “stiffness switch,” which is a dramatic reduction in particle stability during maturation mediated by the viral envelope protein (Pang et al.  2013 ). High-resolution AFM nanoindentation experiments on DNA-filled T7 bacteriophages revealed that the elastic region of the force curves contained discrete, stepwise transitions (Fig.  4 b). These transitions lead to capsid buckling in steps, the size of which is integer multiples of about half a nanometer. The transitions are reversible, as similar steps were observed during cantilever retraction. The reverse steps contribute to the structural recovery of the capsid following mechanical perturbation. The steps were present even after DNA removal, indicating that they reflect the structure and dynamics of the capsid proteins (May and Brooks Iii  2012 ; Vörös et al.  2017 ). Upon gently tapping the capsid wall of the T7 bacteriophage with the tip of an AFM cantilever, the virus rapidly ejected its DNA. At increasing mechanical loads, the rate of triggering DNA ejection increased exponentially. The low forces employed caused very small changes in the internal pressure of the capsid, yet they were sufficient to trigger DNA ejection. Thus, a DNA-filled capsid is in a state poised for expelling its genomic material and the proteins required for the faithful execution of the initial steps of phage infection (Kellermayer et al.  2018 ). Nanomechanical measurements may reveal the response of the virion to environmental factors. Exposing T7 bacteriophage to a thermal treatment at 65 °C caused DNA release due to the tail complex breaking off from the capsid. The loss of DNA and/or thermally driven changes in capsid protein structure results in reduced capsid stiffness and breaking force. Further heating to 80 °C leads to the appearance of large globular particles that likely correspond to disassembled capsids. It also results in partial structural stabilization of the remaining capsids, most likely caused by rearrangements within the capsid wall (partial denaturation of the component gp10A proteins). Even though the capsids are destabilized, they are still able to withstand high temperatures with a more or less intact global topographical structure (Vörös et al.  2018 ). Altogether, AFM-based nanomechanical experiments provide a sensitive tool to explore the properties of viruses (Cieplak and Robbins  2013 ; Hernando-Pérez et al.  2014a ; Kurland et al.  2012 ; Mateu  2012 ). Nanomechanical parameters, such as stiffness and capsid breaking force, may reveal molecular mechanisms underlying capsid maturation and the packaging, storage, and release of genetic material. Combining AFM with other methods, such as total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF), provides further possibilities for the complex analysis of viral biological processes. Fig. 4 Nanoindentation of a viral capsid. a Schematics of the experiment. The capsid and AFM cantilever tip are indicated with a realistic relative scale. Mechanical information can be collected, in the form of force versus distance data, during both the indentation and retraction phases of the experiment.  b  Force versus distance plot obtained on a T7 phage particle (Vörös et al.  2017 ). Force sawteeth during indentation and retraction point at buckling and unbuckling events, respectively, which result in stepwise, 6-nm reversible structural changes in the capsid. The slope of the indentation trace may be used to calculate the stiffness of the capsid Viral infection tracking by super-resolution single-molecule fluorescence imaging Fluorescence microscopy techniques have long been widely used for studying various biological processes due to their versatility. Although wide-field fluorescence microscopy is most common due to ease of use and relatively low cost, its significant drawback is that photons from out-of-focus regions contribute to the observed signal; therefore, the imaging of small particles such as viruses or proteins is challenging due to the high background signal. Special forms of fluorescence microscopy have been developed to overcome this problem. In total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), light is detected only from the focal plane; thus, the low background allows the studying of individual molecules in small (TIRF) or large (CLSM) volumes even with three-dimensional reconstruction. These techniques are, however, limited by the diffraction of light, and the best resolution achieved is ~ 200 nm according to Abbe’s law. Biomolecular processes occurring in this length scale, e.g., virus-host cell binding or enzyme-substrate interaction, thus have not been possible to explore with optical microscopy. One solution to this problem was Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) which can be used as a molecular ruler across small distances (1–10 nm). Despite its technical challenges, FRET has been applied to investigate virus-host interactions (Emmott et al.  2015 ; Koh et al.  2011 ; Takagi et al.  2017 ). A fundamental solution that overcomes the limitations of Abbe’s law is super-resolution (SR) microscopy, which has been revolutionizing life sciences and is paving its way into single-particle virology. SR microscopies can be divided into two broad groups based on their approach to bypass the diffraction limit: stochastic (Fig.  5a ) and deterministic (Fig.  5b ). Fig. 5 Super-resolution microscopy techniques employed in single-particle virus research.  a  Principles of stochastic methods (STORM and PALM).  b  Principles of the deterministic approach in STED.  c  Principle of the shaping of the point spread function (PSF).  d  Example of influenzavirus A (IAV) infection in a human dendritic cell. Blue color corresponds to Alcian blue in the cellular environment, gray to the DAPI-stained nucleus, and green to IAV nucleoprotein labeled with FITC-conjugated antibody. Adapted from (Baharom et al.  2017 ) Stochastic SR microscopies are based on either photoactivatable (photoactivated localization microscopy, PALM) or photoswitchable (stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, STORM) dyes (Betzig et al.  2006 ; Rust et al.  2006 ). During image acquisition, only a small subset of the labeled particles is activated simultaneously by the excitation laser; then, the dye molecules are bleached. The laser activates the fluorophores with a spatial stochasticity until all of them have emitted photons and become bleached (Fig.  5a ). Emission is detected by sensitive sCMOS detectors, and the centroids of the fluorescence spots are calculated based on the point spread function (PSF). Using these coordinates, super-resolution images are reconstructed, the typical spatial resolution of which may be as good as 20 nm. By contrast, the temporal resolution is low due to the numerous activation/photobleaching cycles necessary for image formation. PALM microscopy was used in a proof-of-concept effort to follow single virus particles in transfected cells. It was clearly demonstrated that the imaging speed can be sufficient to reconstitute trajectories of single virus particles in live cells (Manley et al.  2008 ). Several studies on influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein were carried out by PALM microscopy variations revealing HA’s relationship with host-cell actin meshwork. These results may help to find new targets to develop antiviral treatments (Gudheti et al.  2013 ; Hess et al.  2007 ; Nelson et al.  2014 ). STORM microscopy was used in several studies related to viral infection. Pereira et al. proved that the HIV-1 matrix shell and capsid core can be quantified by STORM. It was also demonstrated that HIV particles undergo dramatic rearrangement immediately after entry into the target cells (Pereira et al.  2012 ). A further study combining STORM and cryo-EM revealed that this increase in size is solely triggered by the CD4-Env binding and is independent of virus fusion (Pham et al.  2015 ). Deterministic SR microscopies (Fig.  5b ) rely on the controlled excitation of fluorophores in the focal volume and the confinement of the excitation volume by point-spread-function engineering (Fig.  5c ). The most representative member of this category is stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy (Hell and Wichmann  1994 ). STED uses selective deactivation of fluorophores with a doughnut-shaped depletion laser beam, which creates a minimized excitation area at the focal point. The size of this area can be reduced by increasing the intensity of the depletion laser (Fig.  5c ), yielding a much smaller focal point than would be allowed by the diffraction limit. STED is combined with point-scanning devices; thus, photon collection is deterministic and SR image formation is immediate. As a result, temporal resolution exceeds that of stochastic approaches and there is no need for image post-processing. Due to the fast imaging rate, STED microscopy is suitable for live-cell imaging and hence the investigation of viral entry into the cell (Fig.  5d ). The resolution of STED is theoretically infinite; however, it depends strongly on the fluorophores and the hardware used. The typical resolution that can be achieved even in live-cell imaging is 30–40 nm. STED microscopy related to viruses was first demonstrated with GFP-labeled rotaviruses (Willig et al.  2006 ). STED microscopy was used to explore how HIV-1 enters CD4+ cells. It was clearly demonstrated, by using dual-color STED microscopy, that cell contact can induce the clustering of mobile Env molecules promoting the maturation of the virion (Chojnacki et al.  2012 ). STED-FCS measurements have confirmed that Env mobility is dependent on the virus maturation status (Chojnacki et al.  2017 ). Recently, a novel super-resolution approach called MINFLUX was developed with a capability of resolving luminous points within a 1–3-nm range even in live cells in three dimensions (Balzarotti et al.  2017 ; Gwosch et al.  2020 ), raising the possibility of following viral assembly in situ. Since subviral details may be resolved, yet the speed of image formation is sufficient for tracking single particles in live cells, SR microscopies will likely play an important role in unraveling the molecular details of the viral life cycle. Although key parameters such as temporal and spatial resolution need to be further improved, super-resolution microscopies are expected to expand and contribute significantly to understanding the viral infectious cycle at the level of the single virion. Mechanisms and mechanics of viral infection Ever since the discovery of viruses, the mechanisms of the viral infection process have been in the center of scientific, medical, and even economic interest. Most of our knowledge has come from the high-resolution structures provided by electron microscopy studies of the past decades, which enabled us to predict the functions of different parts of viral nanomachines. In the recent past, cryo-electron microscopy has been providing an ever-increasing detail about the structure of viruses, lending clues to the infection mechanisms (Guo et al.  2014 ; Kaelber et al.  2017 ; Pham et al.  2015 ; Serwer et al.  2018 ; Shingler et al.  2013 ; Wrapp et al.  2020 ). Besides imaging methods, bulk assays relying on molecular biological techniques have provided key elements to understanding the steps of viral infection. EM and molecular biology techniques provide ensemble snapshots of the viral infection process, but the continuous timeline of events related to a single virion largely remains hidden. Different types of viruses (e.g., DNA and RNA viruses) use vastly different tactics to invade the host. In the recent past, remarkable experimental observations were made on the dynamics of the first steps of infection by individual DNA-virus particles. The ejection of genomic dsDNA was followed in real time by using a combination of microfluidics and total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) video microscopy (Grayson et al.  2007 ; Mangenot et al.  2005 ) (Fig.  6 ). In the experimental layout, virus particles are attached to a coverslip surface which serves as the bottom of a microfluidic device (Fig.  6a ). The viruses are activated by injecting the relevant activator protein along with DNA-intercalating dyes. The interaction of phages and their protein receptors resulted in the sudden ejection of DNA molecules which were immediately stretched out by the flow, allowing their length to be measured as a function of time. In the case of T5, rapid DNA ejection steps were observed with intermittent pauses at distinct locations along the genome, which correlated with the positions of genetically engineered DNA nicks (Mangenot et al.  2005 ). This mechanism appears to be unique compared with other viruses. In the case of λ phage, for example, DNA release was continuous with no apparent pauses (Grayson et al.  2007 ). λ-DNA ejection kinetics is strongly influenced by cations in the ejection medium (Fig.  6b ), which is similar to the effect of environmental osmotic pressure changes (Casjens and Hendrix  2015 ; Marion and Šiber  2014 ; São-José et al.  2007 ; Wu et al.  2010 ). Similar experimental approach was used to monitor the ejection of DNA from the Archaeal virus His1. The rapid DNA ejection process of His1 was dependent on cation concentrations and osmotic pressure changes, similarly to bacteriophages (Hanhijärvi et al.  2013 ). By contrast, His1 DNA ejection was insensitive to changes in pH and temperature, explaining why this virus can withstand harsh environmental conditions (Hanhijärvi et al.  2016 ). The major, yet-to-be answered question concerns the energetics of DNA ejection. It is thought that the initial forces driving the ejection are stored in the self-repulsion between tightly packaged DNA segments. However, this energy cannot be the sole driving force for complete ejection. There needs to be an additional force that finalizes DNA translocation across the target membrane, which might be contributed by internal host enzymes (Molineux and Panja  2013 ). Fig. 6 a  Schematics of investigating the genomic DNA release from individual phage particles by using a microfluidic device, total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, and DNA-intercalating fluorophores.  b  Time-resolved images of the release of dsDNA from a single λ-phage particle. DNA ejection was triggered by adding LamB (maltoporin), an  E. coli  outer-membrane protein, and the DNA molecule was visualized by rapid staining with the fluorescent dye SUBR Gold present in the buffer solution of the microfluidic chamber. Time delay between consecutive DNA images is 0.25 s. Upper and lower image series were recorded in the presence of 10 mM NaCl and 10 MgSO 4 , respectively. Adapted from (Grayson et al.  2007 ) Intact phages may be labeled via their DNA with dye amounts so low that their presence does not disrupt their functions (Eriksson et al.  2007 ). By making use of this method, λ phages were labeled and individual DNA injections into  E. coli  were successfully observed (Van Valen et al.  2012 ). DNA translocations, intermittent with pauses, were complete only by 5 min. By contrast, in vitro DNA ejection proceeds continuously and becomes finished within 10 s (Grayson et al.  2007 ) (Fig.  6b ). In vitro studies showed that ejection velocity is controlled by the amount of DNA left inside the capsid, whereas in vivo translocation is additionally governed by forces acting on the DNA that is already inside the target cell. Further techniques for tracking and visualizing viruses during their infectious steps include patch-clamp methods which have been employed to track the docking of λ phages to their target receptors incorporated in a supported lipid bilayer (Gurnev et al.  2006 ); holographic microscopy, which has been used to track the orientation and DNA release of bacteriophage λ (Goldfain et al.  2016 ). The average DNA release measured by this method was close to that obtained in in vitro experiments using fluorescent labeling. Altogether, to reveal the molecular mechanisms of the numerous different tactical processes that viruses have devised for infecting the host organism, a combination of methods that allow to monitor the spatial and temporal dynamics and mechanics of the different viral components is required. Conclusion and perspectives Viruses are amazing nanoscale machineries which, in spite of their miniscule size and relatively low complexity, are capable of invading the host organism with a puzzling array of tactical mechanisms. Interest in understanding how viruses replicate, assemble, and infect has never vanished ever since their discovery. Single-particle imaging and manipulation methods are of unequalled importance in unveiling the mechanistic detail behind the infectious cycle of viruses. Considering the technological pressures in the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemia towards understanding, diagnosing, treating, and preventing coronavirus infection (Al-Qahtani  2020 ; Astuti and Ysrafil  2020 ; Sheng et al.  2020 ; Wang et al.  2020 ; Yan et al.  2020a ; Yan et al.  2020b ; Zhang et al.  2020 ) and viral infections in general, single-particle virology may provide a unique edge in combating viral diseases. </Body>

    <Abstact>Situs is a modular and widely used software package for the integration of biophysical data across the spatial resolution scales. It has been developed over the last decade with a focus on bridging the resolution gap between atomic structures, coarse-grained models, and volumetric data from low-resolution biophysical origins, such as electron microscopy, tomography, or small-angle scattering. Structural models can be created and refined with various flexible and rigid body docking strategies. The software consists of multiple, stand-alone programs for the format conversion, analysis, visualization, manipulation, and assembly of 3D data sets. The programs have been ported to numerous platforms in both serial and shared memory parallel architectures and can be combined in various ways for specific modeling applications. The modular design facilitates the updating of individual programs and the development of novel application workflows. This review provides an overview of the Situs package as it exists today with an emphasis on functionality and workflows supported by version 2.5.</Abstact>
    <Body>Introduction Scientific computing, including modeling and simulation, is crucial for solving biophysical research problems that are beyond the reach of traditional theoretical and experimental approaches (U.S. Department of Energy  2005 ). Originally confined to a supporting role with respect to experimental or theoretical approaches, modeling and simulation are increasingly seen as capable of creating new evidence in their own right (Lee et al.  2009 ). Computer-generated hypotheses can be confirmed or refuted, like their experimental or theoretical counterparts, even though the virtual (in silico) world is at best an imperfect mirror of the physical (in vivo) world. In the late 1990s, funding agencies in the biological sciences took notice of this opportunity. In April 1998, a special Cell Biology and Biophysics Subcommittee of the U.S. National Advisory General Medical Sciences Council examined research trends in the areas of molecular cell biology, structural biology, and biophysics. Among the needs identified by the panel were better (computational) methods for structural analysis of large macromolecular assemblies and imaging macromolecules in cells. Based in part on these recommendations, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) issued a new program announcement that altered the more traditional biological hypothesis-driven review and award criteria in favor of method development (National Institutes of Health  2000 ). Instead of the traditional proposal style, biophysical scientists in the U.S. could for the first time submit applications based solely on the merit of computational techniques. This paradigm shift was important for the advancement of computational biology, because opportunities for funding computational research had hitherto existed mainly in the physical sciences (U.S. Department of Energy  2005 ). Against the backdrop of the emerging research opportunities in computational biophysics, the  Situs  package was created for the modeling and simulation of large biomolecular assemblies at variable resolution scales.  Situs  was initially conceived as a platform for the dissemination of structural coarse-graining algorithms to the biophysical community. Powerful experimental techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy (Baker and Johnson  1996 ), tomography (Medalia et al.  2002 ), and small-angle scattering (Niemann et al.  2008 ), which routinely produced 3D structures at a reduced spatial resolution, had emerged. These methods were capable of yielding low-resolution density maps under a wide range of biochemical conditions that allow atomic structures of components to be fitted and docked (Baker and Johnson  1996 ; Wriggers and Chacón  2001b ), and they were in need of software to help integrate the structural data. The goal of  Situs  is to characterize the structure and functionally relevant motions of biomolecular systems by integrating experimental data across the resolution scales, using advanced algorithms from neurocomputing, image processing, and visualization. A decade has passed since the publication of the original  Situs  paper (Wriggers et al.  1999 ). This review will assess the software as it is used by scientists today. Naturally, the workflow has changed in many ways over the years as compatible molecular graphics programs have evolved and  Situs  tools have been enhanced, updated, or replaced. The following sections highlight the current  Situs  workflow using published usage examples kindly provided by other laboratories. In the first section, a typical correlation-based docking approach in electron microscopy (EM) is described, using the recent model of the influenza virus ribonucleoprotein complex (Coloma et al.  2009 ) as an example. Next, the integration of structural data with small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data is shown on models of the extracellular region of an EGF receptor family member, s-dEGFR (Alvarado et al.  2009 ). Finally, a flexible fitting approach is shown using coarse-grained resolution models of myosin. Personal comments and annotations by the author are provided in the  electronic supplementary material . Correlation-based docking in electron microscopy Chacón and Wriggers ( 2002 ) introduced  colores , a widely used registration tool that takes advantage of Fourier correlation theory to rapidly scan the six translational and rotational degrees of freedom of a probe molecule relative to a (fixed) target density map. X-ray crystallographic fitting methods, based on volumetric cross-correlation or the free R-value, are limited to resolutions &lt;10 Å where densities exhibit internal structure. The major advantage of  colores  is that it extends the viable resolution range to ∼30 Å by means of a Laplacian operator that emphasizes contour (shape) information in addition to the traditional correlation. Over the years, we have optimized the efficiency and accuracy of  colores  and ported the tool to shared memory environments that take advantage of today’s multi-core architectures. The series of steps and the programs that are required to use  colores  for the docking of a probe structure to a target EM map are shown schematically in Fig.  1 .
 Fig. 1 Schematic diagram of  colores -related routines in  Situs  2.5. Major  Situs  components ( blue ) are classified by their functionality. The main workflow is indicated by brown arrows. The visualization ( orange ) for the rendering of the models requires a molecular graphics viewer such as  VMD  (Humphrey et al.  1996 ),  Chimera  (Pettersen et al.  2004 ), or  Sculptor  ( http://sculptor.biomachina.org ). Standard volumetric map formats are converted to cubic lattices in  Situs  format with the  map2map  utility. Subsequently, the data are inspected and, if necessary, prepared for the fitting using a variety of visualization and analysis tools.  Situs  docking tools require one volume (target) and one PDB structure (probe). Atomic coordinates in PDB format can be transformed to low-resolution maps, if necessary, and vice versa, to allow the docking of maps to maps or structures to structures. The resulting docked complex can be inspected in the graphics program. In addition, if a subset of Euler angles is chosen, these can be inspected (after conversion into PDB format) with the  eul2pdb  tool. 
 Recently,  colores  was successfully used in the modeling of a biologically active influenza virus ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex (Coloma et al.  2009 ). The RNP particles of influenza A viruses are formed by the association of single-stranded RNA to multiple monomers of nucleoprotein (NP) and a single copy of the polymerase complex composed by the PB1, PB2, and PA subunits. Coloma et al. ( 2009 ) succeeded in building a 3D model of RNP by assembling 3D reconstructions from a non-symmetrical complex containing the polymerase (at 18 Å resolution) with the NP ring derived from a symmetrical volume (at 12 Å resolution). The docking of the atomic structures of NP and partial structures of PB1 and PA in this chimera map is shown in Fig.  2 . The result, described in more detail by Coloma et al. ( 2009 ), is the first structural model for a functional viral RNP complex.

 Visualization and modeling of small-angle scattering data 3D bead models of proteins in solution can be determined from 1D scattering data, in particular from SAXS (Chacón et al.  2000 ). Wriggers and Chacón ( 2001a ) extended existing  Situs  tools to provide an atomic interpretation of SAXS-derived shapes. The workflow and the programs that are used to dock an atomic structure into low-resolution SAXS models are shown schematically in Fig.  3 . The bead models can be transformed into volumetric maps for subsequent docking using convolution with a hard sphere kernel ( pdb2vol  tool). The SAXS modeler then has access to all docking strategies supported by  Situs , including correlation-based docking ( colacor / colores ) and point cloud matching ( qrange / matchpoint ), and even flexible fitting (see below). To test the docking accuracy, we added the  pdb2saxs  tool to map atomic structures of trial proteins to hexagonal close-packed lattices with variable bead radii. The resulting models served as “simulated” low-resolution data in Wriggers and Chacón ( 2001a ): For &gt;100 beads typically arising in SAXS models, a rigid body docking precision can be achieved of the order of an Angstrom.
 Fig. 3 Schematic diagram of SAXS-related routines in  Situs  2.5. Visualization and modeling of atomic structures into SAXS bead models are supported through a conversion into 3D volumes representing the beads using the  pdb2vol  kernel convolution tool. Docking between atomic structures and 3D maps can be achieved through a number of approaches (see text). The data can be prepared further for the visualization using a variety of analysis and editing tools. Optional Gaussian kernel convolution with  pdb2vol  facilitates the smoothing of bead surfaces for their visualization in the form of density isocontours 
 Another specific problem in the interpretation of SAXS data is the visualization of the beads. We found it useful to render not the densely packed beads themselves, but rather an envelope that can be created by isocontouring a volumetric map that was created by convolution with a soft kernel such as a Gaussian (using  pdb2vol ). Our approach to rendering and interpretation of SAXS data has been adopted by other groups (Lipfert et al.  2007 ; Fagan et al.  2009 ). Here, we highlight a recent  Nature  article on structural studies of the single epidermal growth factor receptor family member (dEGFR) in  Drosophila melanogaster . Alvarado et al. ( 2009 ) determined the 2.7 Å X-ray crystal structure of the unliganded dEGFR extracellular region, encompassing domains I to IV (s-dEGFRΔV). A structural overlay of an active, extended, receptor tyrosine kinase sErbB2 and s-dEGFRΔV showed them to be remarkably similar, with important functional implications. One key question was whether crystal packing causes s-dEGFRΔV to be extended. This hypothesis was ruled out by SAXS studies of s-dEGFRΔV and complete s-dEGFR (Fig.  4 ). The  Situs -derived models, shown in Fig.  4 , indicate that s-dEGFRΔV is extended in solution (the envelope readily encompasses the crystal structure), and that domain V (orange) simply projects from the end of domain IV (red) to extend the structure further.
 Fig. 4 Low-resolution molecular envelopes from SAXS studies of s-dEGFRΔV ( left ) and s-dEGFR ( right ). The envelopes ( blue ), created after kernel convolution with  pdb2vol , readily accommodate the  Situs -docked crystallographic models (see text). The graphic, kindly provided by Diego Alvarado and Mark Lemmon, emphasizes interior domain details; see also Fig.  2b  in Alvarado et al. ( 2009 ) 
 Flexible fitting Rigid-body docking, as described above, laid the groundwork for the development of a flexible docking technique that brings deviating features of multi-resolution structures into register. In such situations, the atomic structure is moved towards the target density by systematically reducing the rms deviation between coarse-grained control points in a refinement of the atomic structure. One of the open questions in flexible docking is how to maintain the stereochemical quality of a fitted structure, since any over-fitting to noisy experimental data would compromise the quality of the atomic model. In an earlier review article (Wriggers et al.  2004 ), we described the details of a significant improvement to our flexible fitting algorithm, the Motion Capture Network (MCN). The basic idea of the workflow, depicted in Fig.  5 , is that lateral connections (distance constraints) are formed between control points that reflect the connectivity of the biological polypeptide chain. This approximation of the movement can be justified by the statistics of biomolecular domain motions documented in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). In the following, a (previously unpublished) modeling of the actomyosin complex illustrates MCN-based flexible fitting.
 Fig. 5 Schematic diagram of flexible fitting with  Situs  2.5. The modeling of distance constraints for the MCN is shown in  dark blue . Standard volumetric map formats are converted with the  map2map  utility and the data can be prepared for coarse graining by vector quantization using a variety of map visualization and analysis tools. Atomic coordinates in PDB format can be transformed to low-resolution maps, if necessary, and vice versa. During vector quantization of the high-resolution structure, distances can be learnt that are sent to the vector quantizer of the low-resolution structure to enable MCN-based fitting. After the vector quantization, the high-resolution structure is flexibly docked by the  qplasty  tool (Rusu et al.  2008 ). As an alternative to spatial interpolation with  qplasty , a molecular dynamics refinement is also supported 
 An atomic model of F-actin (Holmes et al.  2003 ) was fitted to the 14 Å resolution actomyosin map (data kindly provided by Rasmus R. Schröder, now at University of Heidelberg, during his visit to Houston in 2003). The F-actin structure allowed us to create a mask for a single myosin S1 unit by low-pass filtering from the docked atomic structure using  pdb2vol . As described by Wriggers and Chacón ( 2001b ), the mask was needed by the tools  voledit  and  voldiff  to segment and subtract densities from actin and neighboring symmetry-related subunits and to obtain the density of a single myosin S1 from the helical 3D map. This single myosin S1 map was then compared to the atomic structure. We first attempted rigid-body fitting of the atomic model, taken from the supplementary structure “motor domain.pdb” (Holmes et al.  2003 ), into the 3D map with  colores , as described above. Rigid-body docking was not satisfactory with respect to the position of the upper 50K domain and the lever arm, even when performed independently for each structural subunit. Therefore, we subjected the predicted atomic model to flexible docking (Fig.  6 ) to characterize the observed changes. The flexible docking procedure was based on a connected MCN of identified features within the atomic model (Wriggers et al.  2004 ). The atomic model was allowed to move according to displacements tracked by 10 control points defined by the network, to find the best match to the cryo-EM map. The number of control points was judged to be sufficient for capturing the shape details of the single S1 map that occupies a volume of 185,000 Å 3  at the isocontour level shown (Fig.  6 ). The number of independent pieces of information contained in the 14 Å resolution map is then 185,000/14 3  ≈ 67. This number comprises an upper bound for the number of recognizable features in this particular volume. The conservative choice of 10 points (corresponding to a spatial resolution of 26 Å in the reduced network) was significantly below this upper bound to avoid an over-fitting of the data (Wriggers and Chacón  2001b ). This level of detail, however, was quite sufficient for the flexing.

 The longitudinal distance constraints in the MCN were assigned manually, as described by Wriggers et al. ( 2004 ), by following the connectivity of the polypeptide chain and to ensure robustness of the control points during the shape change. We found by trial and error that motion capture was best achieved through allocating more flexibility to the 50K regions (effectively allowing cleft closure) by eliminating all constraints on the motion of control points in this region. The final network used for the automated flexing is shown in Fig.  6 . We performed the flexing by adding a constraint energy function to the Hamiltonian of a molecular dynamics simulation that penalizes global shape differences between the data sets (Wriggers et al.  2004 ). In the molecular dynamics run, we added water molecules predicted by DOWSER (Zhang and Hermans  1996 ) to the system, which resulted in a total system size of 12,008 atoms. One can expect that at 14 Å resolution the flexing faithfully reproduces conformational differences with a precision of 2 Å if atomic structures are locally conserved (Wriggers et al.  2004 ). Side chains are rearranged automatically to accommodate global conformational changes. Otherwise, the algorithm leaves the initial structure intact at the local level. Whether this assumption holds depends on the nature of the conformational difference between the two isoforms, which is not known a priori. However, it has been shown that only about 7% of protein domain rearrangements documented in the PDB are irregular motions where the tertiary structure is significantly perturbed (Gerstein and Krebs  1998 ). Therefore, it is plausible, at least for the predominantly hinge-type domain motions exhibited by myosin, that the low-resolution flexible fitting approach visualizes conformational changes with a precision of single amino acid residues. The final flexing-induced rms deviation in the atomic model was 5.3 Å. To validate the precision and probe for systematic errors, we also performed a control flexing calculation on the structure of myosin 5 (Coureux et al.  2003 ). Myosin 5 is deemed to be in closer agreement with the 3D map of S1 in actomyosin (Holmes et al.  2004 ). Following the above protocols, we created a model of myosin 5, resulting in a total system size of 11,150 atoms. The observed flexing-induced rms deviation in the atomic model was 3.8 Å, which was indeed much lower than that observed in the myosin 2 case. The above tests validate the  Situs -based flexible fitting approach with a real EM data set. More detailed and systematic tests of flexible fitting were published in Rusu et al. ( 2008 ). In addition, the myosin fitting was recently extended to full thick filaments of tarantula muscle in collaboration with the group of Raúl Padrón in Venezuela (Alamo et al.  2008 ). Conclusion One key to the success of  Situs  over the years has been that the programs were ported to multiple platforms and their source code was freely available on the Internet ( http://situs.biomachina.org ). While we strive to teach at workshops and symposia, it seems that many researchers prefer to explore software in their own laboratories. Our web-based tutorials have helped hundreds of electron microscopists and small- angle scattering experts to learn the use of the programs. For their dissemination, we obtained our own web domain ( http://biomachina.org ) and web server. Another helpful aspect was the modular design of the programs. As mentioned above, the software consists of multiple, stand-alone tools that can be combined in various creative ways. The modular design allowed us to update individual programs over time (inevitably, it becomes necessary to update algorithms and to implement bug fixes for problems reported to us). We are managing an e-mail list to communicate with the more than 2,000 registered users who opted to receive information. Readers should feel free to send comments to situs@biomachina.org. This brief review primarily focused on the scientific use of the software, but the development of  Situs  was also a personal journey for the author, with many memorable encounters along the way. A personal history of this work, as well as annotated references, can be found in the  electronic supplementary material .

    <Abstact>After first describing the issue contents (Biophysical Reviews—Volume 12 Issue 6), this Editorial goes on to provide a short round-up of the activities of the journal in 2020. Directly following this Editorial are two obituaries marking the recent deaths of Prof. Fumio Oosawa (Japan) and Dr. Herbert Tabor (USA)—two major figures in Biophysical/Biochemical science from the last 100 years.</Abstact>
    <Body>With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 has been a testing year for all. Filled with a myriad combination of personal tragedies and work/life inconveniences, circumstances have required many difficult decisions to be made at the personal, family, organizational and society levels with the results of these difficult choices amplifying the general level of stress within communities. Scientists have certainly not been immune from such pressures. For working scientists, this year has presented a number of challenges. Those scientists heavily involved in teaching have had to engage with remote teaching methodologies and the necessarily rapid preparation of additional online teaching materials. Research-focused scientists have had to cope with the closing or restriction of work facilities and the loss of personnel, which has certainly impacted (and often disrupted) scientific progress. For the many itinerant working scientists living away from home and family, the restrictions on worldwide travel have caused additional dilemmas and necessitated difficult career decisions. Student scientists have had to deal with other problems. Oftentimes educational institutions have maintained the steep fee requirements associated with enrolment despite the year being a virtual write-off in terms of focusing on academic performance. Overseas students have also faced problems related to maintaining interdependent attendance and residence requirements. Irrespective of the stage of their career progression, scientists (like all members of society) have tried their best to make the most of a bad situation. In 2020, the Biophysical Reviews’ Editorial Board and the specifically dedicated professional officers from Springer-Nature have similarly pushed on with our journal related duties. From 2018, Biophysical Reviews moved to a six Issue per year format. The current Issue (Issue 6) is the last for 2020, and as such, the first duty of this Editorial is to describe the contents of the twelve articles appearing within it. After providing a precis of these articles, we then move on to describe some of the highlights of this year and finish by welcoming some new members to the Editorial Board. Precis of articles in Issue 6 Aside from the present Editorial (Hall  2020a ), the front matter for this Issue consists of a sub-editorial, introducing Dr. Antonio Benedetto (one of the journal’s Editorial Board Members) (Benedetto  2020 ) and two Commentaries (Maèda and Oda  2020 ; McPhie  2020 ), that respectively present obituaries for Dr. Fumio Oosawa and Dr. Herbert Tabor—two giants of the Biophysical/Biochemistry science scene. I had the good fortune to meet and spend some time with both of these scientists (about who these obituaries have been written) and highly recommend these interesting Commentaries written from both the scientific and human perspective. In my opinion, the authors do a remarkable job of providing the reader with a window into the lives of these very distinguished scientists, thereby providing worthy tributes. Following the front material are eight topical review articles with the first two (Lavington and Watts  2020 ; Shechtman  2020 ) being requested contributions from the senior (Dr. Anthony Watts) and junior (Dr. Yoav Shechtman) winners of the IUPAB Investigator Awards for 2020. The article by Lavington and Watts ( 2020 ) describes how different membrane mimics can be used for the structural study of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) using solid-state NMR methods. As perhaps the most important class of integral membrane proteins, GPCRs carry out a number of different biological functions associated with cell growth, death and division, and are therefore much studied as possible pharmaceutical targets. Lavington and Watts ( 2020 ) describe their (and others) research on GPCRs using membrane nanoparticles, such as lipid nanodiscs and styrene maleic acid lipid particles (SMALPs) as structurally well-defined membrane-like environments having tuneable properties. The contribution by Shechtman ( 2020 ) provides a very readable introduction to the subject of super-resolution microscopy before going on to detail the authors’ contributions to the information processing aspects of this field of microscopy. Starting with a mathematical description of the point spread function the author details how suitable treatment of the signal can result in near nanometre level assignment of details present within biological specimens (2020). Following these two award-related contributions are six invited reviews on a disparate range of topics. The first of these (Rajendra and Brahmajirao  2020 ) is concerned with the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods for the analysis of dynamical/time series data. Whilst the scientific community is becoming familiar with AI/ML for the processing of static information (such as image /structural analysis; face recognition), they are perhaps less aware of the use of such procedures for the processing of time series data. In this article, Rajendra and Brahmajirao ( 2020 ) do a good job of describing how coupling of intermediate numerical methods based on differential equations can be used to fill the static to dynamic AI/ML information processing ‘gap’. The next review article, contributed by Mizuguchi and Nuriya ( 2020 ), describes recent developments in second harmonic generation (SHG)/sum frequency generation (SFG) methodologies. Revolving around two-photon superposition/joint action principles, the authors utilize Jablonski-type diagrams to describe the optical physics, walking the reader through the history and recent developments in the field with an emphasis on the use of these techniques for characterization of biological events occurring within the cellular plasma membrane. This article by Mizuguchi and Nuriya ( 2020 ) serves both as an excellent primer on the optical phenomenon and a good survey of its recent application to create superior biological imaging techniques. The following article by Kumar et al. ( 2020 ) is concerned with the pathogenically important calcium binding proteins of the amoeba,  E. histolytica , associated with causing the human diseases of colitis and dysentery. The authors review three-dimensional structural information gained on the nearly thirty known  E. histolytica  calcium-binding proteins which show some degree of acid sequence similarity to calmodulin (Ca-M). 1  Kumar et al. propose arguments tying the apparent structural diversity seen within the amoebic calcium-binding protein family to apparent functional diversity required for interaction with different partner proteins present across a range of signalling and regulatory pathways (Kumar et al.  2020 ). The next Review, by Pratt et al. ( 2020 ), continues with the calcium theme by focusing on the role that this divalent cation plays in the regulation of breast cancer development. This well-written review article spends considerable effort on the scientific history of the discovery of calcium’s role in cell signalling. Focusing on quantitative aspects, the authors discuss the action of calcium ions on various signalling pathways as a function of the amplitude, frequency and spatial characteristics of the calcium ion levels. Reviewing both the analytical methodology and the biological ‘circuitry’ affected by calcium, this article discusses how cancerous cells can exploit aberrant calcium regulation to direct cancer specific cell fates involving growth or metastases (Pratt et al.  2020 ). The penultimate review deals with recent developments in the biophysics and biomechanics of the machine/muscle interface (Gohel and Mehendale  2020 ). Treating both the equipment required for recording electrical activity occurring within the muscle, and the algorithms required for signal deconvolution and subsequent completion of the transduction to electronic or mechanical output, the article by Gohel and Mehendale ( 2020 ) provides the reader with a very readable glimpse into human’s ever closer relationship with machines, with such technology proffering both smoother machine control and hope for restoration of quality of life for those suffering injuries. The final contribution to this last Issue of Biophysical Reviews for 2020 is a highly focused review article on the nucleic acid binding properties of the plant alkaloid chelerythrine (Basu and Suresh  2020 ). As a relatively small molecule, chelerythrine and its alkaloid derivatives/analogues, show intriguing binding specificity with regard to type (DNA vs RNA), strand (single vs. double vs. triple) and sequence (base vs. short sequence) and as such suggests itself for possible usage in the construction of molecular tools used in biology and medicine. After reviewing a large number of biophysical studies, Basu and Suresh ( 2020 ) explore this latter aspect, reviewing chelerythrine’s potential as an anticancer drug candidate. Highlights of 2020 The six Issues of Biophysical Reviews in 2020 consisted of two Special Issues and four regular Issues. This year saw over hundred and sixty articles published. Here I provide a (very) short flavour of some of the diverse set of topics covered in each Issue. Issue 1 started off with equal parts hope and sadness with the respective announcement of the inaugural winner of the Michèle Auger winner (Dr. Alexandra Zidovska) (Hall  2020b ) and the obituary for Dr. Christopher M. Dobson (Dumoulin  2020 ). Some of the interesting review articles in Issue 1 included those on the topics of hybrid biosynthetic strategies (Alissandratos  2020 ), dramatic effects of proline substitution on protein structural propensities (Ganguly and Basu  2020 ), computational studies of the interaction of urea with protein interfaces (Raghunathan et al.  2020 ) and the use of the differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) for high throughput drug candidate screening (Gao et al.  2020 ). Issue 2 saw the first instalment of the Biophysical Reviews partnership program with various countries’ national biophysical societies that is aimed at providing readers with a closer look at the biophysical research and organizational structures in place within a particular country. In Issue 2, we explored the Biophysical Society of Japan (BSJ) (Komatsuzaki et al.  2020 ; Hall  2020c ). The front matter contained within it numerous fascinating Commentaries about the BSJ’s organizational units which included contributions by the executive officers (Harada  2020 ; Akiyama  2020 ; Miyata  2020 ; Nakamura  2020 ), Japanese biophysical journal Editors (Sako  2020 ; Ishiwata  2020a ,  b ) and five consortiums describing biophysical research at various national centres and universities (Aizawa et al.  2020 ; Akiyama et al.  2020a ,  b ; Ando  2020a ,  b ; Takano et al.  2020 ). This section was further complemented by contributions from senior (Kataoka  2020 ) and junior members (Okamoto  2020 ). The bulk of the Special Issue was composed of numerous review articles (forty-five) chosen from the nearly thirty separate sections of the BSJ’s national society meeting. A short selection of these (many) interesting review articles includes those dealing with the biophysics of chromatin (Ashwin et al.  2020 ; Kumar and Kono  2020 ); optogenetics (Kandori  2020 ); computational structure prediction (Kinoshita and Hayashi  2020 ; Leitner and Yamamoto  2020 ; Tsuchiya and Tomii  2020 ); physical biochemistry (Tsumoto et al.  2020 ); molecular motors (Li and Toyabe  2020 ; Loutschko and Flechsig  2020 ; Noji et al.  2020 ); membrane protein interaction (Moghal et al.  2020 ); novel scattering, structural and imaging techniques (Nakasako et al.  2020 ; Uchihashi and Ganser  2020 ; Yamaoki et al.  2020 ; Yokoyama et al.  2020 ); cellular biophysics (Okazaki et al.  2020 ; Yasuda  2020 ); biophysical thermochemistry (Fukuyama and Maeda  2020 ; Suzuki and Plakhotnik  2020 ); and biophysical theory (Leitner and Yamamoto  2020 ; Uda  2020 ). Volume 12 Issue 3 (Hall  2020d ) was a regular Issue that contained eleven articles. With no set theme, the contributed articles covered a range of topics with some of the highlight review pieces dealing with Brillouin microscopy (Antonacci et al.  2020 ); cellular imaging using atomic force microscopy (Zapotoczny et al.  2020 ); and exploration of novel second messenger systems (Petchiappan et al.  2020 ) and laboratory based studies of evolution (Horinouchi and Furusawa  2020 ). Issue 4 was the second scheduled Special Issue for 2020 (Hall et al.  2020 ). Titled ‘Biophysics of Human Anatomy and Physiology’, this festschrift collected articles related to the biophysics of physiological processes (particularly related to the heart) for the occasion of the 80 th  birthday of Dr. Cristobal dos Remedios. A powerhouse of biophysical research, both in Australia and on the international stage, Cristobal dos Remedios was long active within IUPAB and was also a former Chief Editor of Biophysical Reviews (dos Remedios  2020 ). Over a fifty-five year career Cris made important breakthroughs in both the molecular understanding of muscle function (through his pioneering studies on Förster resonance energy transfer experiments of actin myosin structural relations) as well as the general design and execution of cardiac muscle biophysical research (through the establishment of the Sydney Heart Bank). This Special Issue saw over forty-two contributions from scientific collaborators and peers accrued over his long career. The front material of the Issue contained a number of personal and scientific Commentaries addressing various stages of Cris’ life (Hall et al.  2020 ; Ishiwata  2020a ,  b ; van Dijk  2020 ; Li  2020 ). The bulk of the scientific content of this Issue was constituted by twenty-two topical review articles that spanned different areas of cardiac research. Some particularly noteworthy examples dealt with growth factor directed therapy for cardiac muscle repair (White and Chong  2020 ); cardiomyocyte fluoresce-based microscopy methods (Janco et al.  2020 ; Pandzic et al.  2020 ; Hassan et al.  2020 ); cellular mechano-transduction and shape determinants on cell growth regulation (Esfahani and Knöll  2020 ; Pruna and Ehler  2020 ; Harley et al.  2020 ); synthetic biology approaches to the study of motor proteins (Linke et al.  2020 ); use of plasma technology in surgical equipment surface treatment (Harley et al.  2020 ); and the regulatory pathways and structural roles of profilin (Davey and Moens  2020 ). Containing twenty articles, Volume 12, Issue 5, was the third regular-type Issue of 2020 for Biophysical Reviews (Hall, 2020-e). A feature of this Issue was the invited review article by Dr. Alexandra Zidovska, the inaugural winner of the Michèle Auger award for young scientists’ independent research (Hall  2019a ,  b ; IUPAB  2018 ). In her award article Alexandra reviewed salient material within her thematic topic of cytosol rheology (Zidovska  2020 ). In addition, her article carried two short personal biographies of both herself and Michele Auger—the scientist and former Biophysical Reviews Editorial Board Member for whom the award acts as a perpetual memorial. Issue 5 also included contributions on topics covering the evolution of the cellular unit (Kundu et al.  2020 ); theoretical constraints to evolution (Furusawa and Irie  2020 ); single particle approaches to the study of virus particles (Kiss et al.  2020 ); and cryo-preparation methods for electron and mixed microscopy imaging methodologies (Yusuf et al.  2020 ). Biophysical reviews’ meet the editors series In 2020 the journal started including within each Issue a short biographical sketch of members of the Editorial Board. The first five Issues of Volume 12 concentrated on introducing the five internationally based Executive Editors. Provided by Wilma Olson, based in the USA (Olson  2020 ), Kuniaki Nagayama (Japan) (Nagayama  2020 ), Naranamangalam Jagannathan (India) (Jagannathan  2020 ), Joshua Ho (Hong Kong, China) (Ho  2020 ) and Rosangela Itri (Brazil) (Itri, 2020), these articles can additionally serve the readership by providing an easy point of access to a senior Editor in your geographic location. In the final Issue of the year we started introducing regular members of the Editorial Board, with the first being Antonio Benedetto based in Ireland (Benedetto  2020 ). With over 40 international members constituting the Biophysical Reviews’ Editorial Board, we envisage that this ‘Meet the Editors Series’ will continue for a number of years to come! Social media This year saw the continuing success of Biophysical Reviews social media program. 2  Consisting of a Twitter™ feed and a YouTube™ channel, Biophysical Reviews does its utmost to utilize its social media arm to provide authors with post-publication promotional opportunities. In doing so, we ask authors to exploit the Springer-Nature SharedIt™ tool—a device that enables free posting and sharing of published content across any internet platform (Hall  2017 ,  2019a ,  b ). The journal’s social media sites can be accessed at the following web addresses. Biophysical reviews YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzG_5MWmnrB2UBibtxs2DuA Biophysical reviews twitter account @BiophysicalRev1 Concluding remarks and hopes for 2021 Developed by IUPAB as a vehicle to help promote biophysical research and education at the international, national and community levels, Biophysical Reviews has increased its published output and philanthropic activities during 2020. The many benefits of focusing on review content have been expounded upon within the journal (Hall  2019a ,  b ). As evidenced by the latest journal metrics, Biophysical Reviews has continued to develop since its inception in 2009 (Scimago  2020 ). Now ranked 11 th  amongst journals in the biophysics section and having a Q1 rating in both the biophysics and structural biology groups, Biophysical Reviews is one of the top platforms for publishing biophysics-related content. A journal such as Biophysical Reviews (that operates on an invitation contribution model) is very much the sum of its Editorial Board Members. As such, I would like to thank the existing members of the Editorial Board (Table  1 ) for their efforts throughout the year. It is also my pleasure to welcome new members to the Board for 2021 (new members shown in bold in Table  1 ). It is with fervent hope that the situation in 2021 improves for the better, and on behalf of the journal, I would like to wish all readers and contributors the very best for the coming year.

    <Title>Greetings from IUPAB Secretary General</Title>

    <Authors>Gómez-Fernández Juan C.</Authors>
    <Abstact>This commentary provides a short description of IUPAB’s past and present activities from the IUPAB’s Secretary General, Dr. Juan C. Gómez-Fernández.</Abstact>
    <Body>The year that just ended was a very difficult one for all of us due to the devastation created by the COVID-19 pandemic. We all hope that 2021 will be a year for the beginning of the recovery. Here I briefly discuss some of the disrupted activities of IUPAB along with plans going forward, for a return to normalcy in the coming years. Meetings The IUPAB Congress scheduled to be held in Foz do Iguazú (Brasil) in 2020 was one of the scientific meetings that has been postponed due to the pandemic. It will be now held in October of 2021. Similarly, two IUPAB Focused Meetings due to be held in early 2021, in India and in Canada, have now been postponed for one year, until 2022. In the same fashion, the 2023 IUPAB Congress due to be held in Kyoto in June 2023 is now postponed to similar dates but of 2024. Note that bids to hold the IUPAB Congress in 2027 should be submitted before 1st of May, 2021. General assembly Another consequence of the postponement of the Congress is that the General Assembly cannot be held until 2021. According to Article V of the Statutes and Rules of Procedure: “The work of the Union shall be directed by the General Assembly of delegates, which shall normally meet once every three years,” I think that we are not in a normal situation. To prevent future similar problems, the Executive Committee will propose a change of the Statutes and Rules of Procedures to permit virtual General Assemblies and online votes to elect IUPAB representatives. A General Assembly (online) will be held during February 2021. IUPAB sponsorship Please remember the new modalities of sponsoring policies of IUPAB in  http://iupab.org/sponsorship-policy/ . Among these new modalities are the following: Sponsorship of a prize for communications made by students or young biophysicists. Societies of countries linked to IUPAB as Adhering Bodies may apply for this prize to be awarded to presentations made by young biophysicists during meetings of these societies. The prize could also be given during meetings of associations of young biophysicists. See in this link the details to be taken into account:  http://iupab.org/sponsorship-policy/ . Sponsorship of Plenary Lectures in major biophysics meetings and conferences. IUPAB will sponsor plenary lectures in major meetings or congresses of biophysics like those of EBSA (Europe), ABA (Asia-Pacific), Biophysical Society, and LaFEBS (Latin American countries). See  http://iupab.org/sponsorship-policy/ . Applications should be sent to the Secretary General: jcgomez@um.es. Concluding remarks Finally, I wish you a happy and safe 2021. Juan C.

    <Title>The path to visualization of walking myosin V by high-speed atomic force microscopy</Title>
    <Doi>10.1007/s12551-014-0141-7</Doi>
    <Authors>Kodera Noriyuki, Ando Toshio</Authors>
    <Abstact>The quest for understanding the mechanism of myosin-based motility started with studies on muscle contraction. From numerous studies, the basic frameworks for this mechanism were constructed and brilliant hypotheses were put forward. However, the argument about the most crucial issue of how the actin–myosin interaction generates contractile force and shortening has not been definitive. To increase the “directness of measurement”, in vitro motility assays and single-molecule optical techniques were created and used. Consequently, detailed knowledge of the motility of muscle myosin evolved, which resulted in provoking more arguments to a higher level. In parallel with technical progress, advances in cell biology led to the discovery of many classes of myosins. Myosin V was discovered to be a processive motor, unlike myosin II. The processivity reduced experimental difficulties because it allowed continuous tracing of the motor action of single myosin V molecules. Extensive studies of myosin V were expected to resolve arguments and build a consensus but did not necessarily do so. The directness of measurement was further enhanced by the recent advent of high-speed atomic force microscopy capable of directly visualizing biological molecules in action at high spatiotemporal resolution. This microscopy clearly visualized myosin V molecules walking on actin filaments and at last provided irrefutable evidence for the swinging lever-arm motion propelling the molecules. However, a peculiar foot stomp behavior also appeared in the AFM movie, raising new questions of the chemo-mechanical coupling in this motor and myosin motors in general. This article reviews these changes in the research of myosin motility and proposes new ideas to resolve the newly raised questions.</Abstact>
    <Body>Introduction Motions in biological systems are vital phenomena. They inspire our curiosity to understand how motion is made possible. Skeletal muscles exhibit striking physiological action (i.e. contraction) that is visible to the naked eye and is daily experienced by ourselves. It was, therefore, natural that research into biological motility started with the analysis of muscles. Biochemical studies of muscle proteins revealed that the molecular entities responsible for generating contractile force and shortening comprise just three: myosin, actin, and ATP. Each head of the double-headed myosin hydrolyzes ATP into ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi). The ATPase rate is very low when myosin is alone but is markedly accelerated by its interaction with actin, where the chemical energy liberated by ATP hydrolysis is converted into mechanical work. This energy conversion has most attracted our curiosity and thus been extensively studied using physiological, biophysical, biochemical, structural biological, and theoretical methods. It is noteworthy that several experimental techniques have been applied or created to study muscle contraction, and later used in other fields of biological science. Results obtained in each discipline have built important frameworks and hypotheses for the mechanism of muscle contraction. For example: (1) the relationship between load, speed of shortening, and the rate of heat production in muscle contraction (Hill  1938 ,  1964 ); (2) the filament sliding mechanism in which muscle shortens as a result of the mutual sliding of thin filaments containing actin relative to thick filaments containing myosin (Huxley  1953 ; Huxley and Hanson  1954 ; Huxley and Niedergerke  1954 ); (3) the generation of force by myosin cross-bridges that extend from the myosin filaments to the adjacent actin filaments in the overlap zone in the sarcomere (Huxley  1957a ,  b ); (4) the hypothesis of swinging lever-arm as powerstroke (Huxley  1969 ); (5) the concept of a working stroke of ∼10 nm derived from the swinging lever-arm hypothesis and from the observation of tension recovery following a quick release applied to contracting muscle fibers (Huxley and Simmons  1971 ); and (6) the kinetic scheme of the actomyosin ATPase reaction (Lymn and Taylor  1971 ). These ideas were integrated into a general consensus on the muscle contraction mechanism. Nonetheless, a clue to greater clarification of the chemo-mechanical reaction in actomyosin unexpectedly emerged from the discovery of non-muscle myosins together with the creation of single-molecule biophysical techniques. Currently, there are 35 (or more) distinct classes of myosins designated I to XXXV (Berg et al.  2001 ; Thompson and Langford  2002 ; Richards and Cavalier-Smith  2005 ; Foth et al.  2006 ; Odronitz and Kollmar  2007 ). They constitute the superfamily of actin-based motors that play crucial roles in dynamic cellular processes. In the initial attempt to find non-muscle myosins, first a single-headed myosin (Pollard and Korn  1973 ) and subsequently a traditional double-headed myosin (Maruta and Korn  1977 ) were isolated from  Acanthamoeba . Later, the former was called “myosin I” and the latter “myosin II”. Thereafter, the Roman numerals have been given according to the chronological order of discovery. Among the 35 classes of myosins, myosin V (Mehta et al.  1999 ; Sakamoto et al.  2000 ), VI (Rock et al.  2001 ; Nishikawa et al.  2002 ), VII (Yang et al.  2006 ), X (Nagy et al.  2008 ; Ricca and Rock  2010 ; Sun et al.  2010 ), and XI (Tominaga et al.  2003 ; Hachikubo et al.  2007 ) are known to be processive motors, i.e. a single molecule undergoes multiple catalytic cycles and mechanical advances before dissociation from an actin filament. This processivity promoted the study of myosin motility because it enabled us to continuously trace the motor action of individual molecules. Note that not all isoforms in each of these classes are processive. For example, the yeast myosin V, Myo2p (Reck-Peterson et al.  2001 ), and the  Chara  myosin XI (Kimura et al.  2003 ) are not processive, although Myo2p is switched to a processive motor when tropomyosin is bound to actin filaments (Hodges et al.  2012 ). In parallel with the progress of non-muscle myosin studies, fluorescence microscopy (see review by Joo et al.  2008 ) and optical trap nanometry (see review by Neuman and Block  2004 ) were developed to observe the dynamic action of proteins at the single molecule level. These techniques assisted the discovery of several properties of myosin V (hereafter referred to as M5) including three-to-five successive step advances under load with the ∼36-nm step size (Mehta et al.  1999 ), processive runs of several micrometers under no load (Sakamoto et al.  2000 ), load-dependent stepping kinetics (Veigel et al.  2002 ), the hand-over-hand manner of this movement (Forkey et al.  2003 ; Yildiz et al.  2003 ), and the tight relationship between the catalytic cycle and the 36-nm advance (Sakamoto et al.  2008 ). These discoveries led to a comprehensive view for the action of myosin motors. Nonetheless, a complete consensus has not been reached and more details of the motor action and the underlying chemo-mechanical coupling have remained elusive. Looking back on the long history of myosin motility studies, we notice that the gap between experimental data and conclusions derived therefrom has been slowly reducing. This is because the level of “directness of measurement” has been increasing. Before the single-molecule era, we had to infer the action of individual molecules from experimental data ensemble-averaged over many molecules. Several details of the action of myosin were hidden in the ensemble-average measurements on bulk samples. However, even when single-molecules were observed, their level of directness was not perfect because the subset of observed molecular events depends on the site where an optical probe is placed while the entire molecular structure remained invisible. Myosin has been studied by X-ray crystallography, NMR, and electron microscopy, but these structures are limited to static snapshots and the simultaneous assessment of structure and dynamics seemed impossible. High-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM), which started to be developed around 1993 to overcome this limitation, is now sufficiently advanced (Ando et al.  2008 ) to allow us to video-record the structure and dynamics of functioning biomolecules at single-nanometer resolution, without disturbing their function. This new microscopy was applied to M5 (Kodera et al.  2010 ). The obtained image data revealed details of its molecular action, leading not only to the corroboration of known or inferred behavior of the motor but also to new discoveries (Kodera et al.  2010 ). In particular, it was a surprise to discover that the tension responsible for forward movement can be generated without transitioning through an ADP–Pi-bound state, meaning that no chemical energy input is required for the tension generation. Moreover, the lever-arm swing (powerstroke) by the leading head spontaneously occurs when the trailing head detaches, thus demonstrating that no chemical energy input is required for the lever-arm swing either. These findings appear inconsistent with a popular scheme put forward for the chemo-mechanical reaction in muscle contraction (e.g., Geeves and Holmes  1999 ; Goldman  2004 ). Thus, we now need to develop a unified motor mechanism that can be applied to all classes of myosin motors. This review does not cover the entire range of myosin motors but focuses on studies of the motor mechanism, particularly those performed with the use of single-molecule techniques and our recent HS-AFM study of M5 motility. Readers are referred to reviews on muscle contraction (Geeves and Holmes  1999 ; Huxley  2000 ,  2004 ; Goldman  2004 ), on structure–function relationships of myosins (Ruppel and Spudich  1996 ; Sweeney and Houdusse  2010a ), and on the cellular functions of various myosins (Hartman et al.  2011 ; Coluccio  2008 ). General aspects of myosin The myosin superfamily is largely categorized into the monomeric and dimeric types (Pecham  2011 ), although some myosins can adopt both forms depending on the environment (Park et al.  2006 ; Yu et al.  2009 ; Tokuo et al.  2007 ; Umeki et al.  2011 ) and both types of isoforms sometimes exist in the same class (e.g., monomeric yeast Myo4p and dimeric yeast Myo2p belonging to class V; Bookwalter et al.  2009 ). In stable dimeric myosins, the N-terminal head is followed by a coiled-coil tail domain for dimerization, while in monomeric myosins it is followed by a tail domain or a stable, single α-helical (SAH) domain (Knight et al.  2005 ) and then by a tail domain. The C-terminal tail end generally serves as a cargo-binding domain (Fig.  1 ). In this regard, dimeric myosin II is rather unique. It does not possess a cargo-binding domain and assembles into bipolar thick filaments mediated by a long coiled-coil tail. The tail and cargo-binding domains have diverse amino acid sequences, depending on the intracellular function of myosin (e.g., Sellers  2000 ), while the head region comprising a motor domain and a neck domain is generally common. The motor domain contains two functional sites, the actin-binding and nucleotide-binding sites which communicate with each other. The neck domain comprises a variable number of IQ motifs that bind calmodulin or myosin light chains. The neck is connected to the so-called converter region in the head, and these two as a single entity is called the lever-arm. When the SAH domain follows the neck, it is also included in the lever-arm because it functionally extends the length of the canonical lever-arm (Baboolal et al.  2009 ). The heavy chain in the head comprises three parts (25, 50, and 20–23 kDa) aligned in this order from the N-terminus that were revealed by limited tryptic cleavage of subfragment-1 (S-1) of skeletal myosin II (Mornet et al.  1979 ; Mornet et al.  1981 ). These three parts connected to two surface loops are arranged as shown in Fig.  2  in the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the head (Rayment et al.  1993a ; Houdusse et al.  2000 ). This 3D arrangement of the three parts is largely common to all classes of myosin. The most prominent feature is the presence of a large cleft dividing the 50-K subdomain into lower and upper 50-K subdomains. The outer cleft regions of both lower and upper 50-K subdomains bind to actin mainly through loops. The ATP-binding site is located at the inner cleft region, around which all the three parts face each other. Interestingly, the 3D structure of the catalytic core is very similar to the entire motor domain structure of kinesin despite complete dissimilarity in the amino acid sequence, suggesting that they share a similar force-generating strategy (Kull et al.  1996 ). Fig. 1 Schematic showing domain organization of myosin molecule. The tail part is variable and contains an α-helical coiled-coil, a SAH domain, or a chain segment with a variable amino-acid sequence, depending on the myosin class or isoform. When a SAH domain follows the neck, it is included in the lever-arm because it functionally extends the canonical lever-arm

 Single-headed myosin S-1 binds to actin at a given angle relative to the actin filament. The bound single head (both motor and neck domains) often extends towards the plus end of actin at least in the nucleotide-free and ADP-bound conditions (Rayment et al.  1993b ; Jontes et al.  1995 ). This orientation towards the plus end of actin is called “arrowhead orientation” (Huxley  1963 ). Among all members of the myosin superfamily, only myosin VI is known to move towards the minus (barbed) end of actin (Wells et al.  1999 ). The motor domain of a single-headed myosin VI construct also binds to actin in the arrowhead orientation. However, its neck domain is largely kinked relative to the motor domain, so that the neck domain orients slightly towards the minus end of actin (Wells et al.  1999 ). The swinging lever-arm hypothesis presumes that the lever-arm rotates so that a minute change in the motor domain is amplified to a large displacement of the lever-arm’s distal end. When this presumption is applied to myosin VI, its reversal movement must be achieved by the rotation of the lever-arm in the direction opposite to that of the other myosins (Wells et al.  1999 ). This is consistent with the kinked neck domain of myosin VI and also with the reversal movement of a myosin I construct with an artificial neck which is kinked towards the reverse-arrowhead orientation (Tsiavaliaris et al.  2004 ). The actomyosin ATPase reaction proceeds as shown in Fig.  3 . Immediately after binding to ATP, the actin-bound head detaches from actin, followed by quick hydrolysis of the bound ATP to ADP–Pi. The ADP–Pi-bound head has a low affinity for actin (yet a somewhat stronger affinity than the ATP-bound head). When the ADP–Pi-bound head is attached to actin, the bound Pi dissociates from the head, followed by the formation of a strongly-bound complex of A–M–ADP (A and M denote actin and myosin head, respectively), and then by ADP dissociation. The nucleotide-free head also has a strong affinity for actin. These complexes with strong affinities are called “rigor complexes”. Thus, a myosin head has two states with respect to its affinity for actin, the weak- and strong-binding states. The main role of actin in the ATPase reaction is to accelerate the otherwise very slow Pi and ADP dissociation from a myosin head. The degree of acceleration for Pi dissociation and ADP dissociation varies among the classes of myosin. The processivity occurs in dymeric myosins when the lifetime of A–M–ADP predominates over the other states (De La Cruz et al.  1999 ). Fig. 3 Scheme of muscle actomyosin ATPase reaction including structural model. + indicates the plus end of actin.  Boxes with solid lines and broken lines  represent the strong- and weak-affinity states, respectively. The powerstroke is considered to occur mainly in the transition from the A–M–ADP–Pi state to the A–M–ADP state. The recovery stroke is considered to occur in the transition from the M–ATP state to the M–ADP–Pi state 
 In the prevailing view on myosin motility, the chemo-mechanical coupling is considered to occur as follows (see Fig.  3 ). The myosin head undergoes conformational changes upon ATP binding and hydrolysis to ADP–Pi. Myosin then swings back the lever-arm (“recovery stroke”) (Geeves and Holmes  1999 ). The angle change between the motor and neck domains caused by this recovery stroke facilitates the binding of the head to actin in the reverse arrowhead orientation (note that the motor domain still binds to actin in the arrowhead orientation). The A–M–ADP–Pi state, often termed as the “pre-powerstroke state”, is considered to be a higher-energy state. Upon Pi release, tension for driving the lever-arm swing is generated, the lever-arm actually swings to execute a powerstroke, and then a lower-energy state of A–M–ADP (the post-powerstroke state) is formed. Thus, in this view, the chemical energy liberated by ATP hydrolysis is used mainly in the Pi-release step. Progress of motility assays The situation before the single-molecule era Almost the entire enzymatic kinetics of actomyosin has been obtained from muscle myosin. In most of kinetics measurements, soluble forms of myosin, S-1 and heavy meromyosin (HMM), were used to simplify interpretations of the data. Then, the enzymatic kinetics and the structural characteristics of myosin were combined to understand how the myosin motor might work. Although the overall feature of the enzymatic kinetics was successfully revealed, no mechanical constraints were imposed to myosin molecules interacting with actin filaments in vitro. Therefore, it was difficult to deduce the most important characteristic of the mechano-enzyme, namely how does mechanical strain imposed on myosin affect the ATPase reaction? Moreover, the whole cycle of the ATPase reaction could not be tracked down in one measurement because the initial synchrony among molecules becomes obscured by the stochastic nature of the reaction. Therefore, many kinetic constants derived for the entire reaction scheme were obtained in separate experiments where the reactions were started with different initial states. In some cases, it was difficult to prepare adequate initial states. As such, a quantitative reaction scheme was obtained by “pasting” many results together that were not necessarily obtained under similar solution conditions. The mechanical behavior of myosin interacting with actin filaments could not be observed in solution experiments. To acquire this information, muscle fibers and myofibrils were subjected to X-ray diffraction (Huxley et al.  1981 ,  1983 ), fluorescence polarization (Nihei et al.  1974 ; Borejdo and Putnam  1977 ), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy (Thomas and Cooke  1980 ), and force analyses (Ford et al.  1977 ). At a very early stage intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence or fluorescent ATP analogues were used for fluorescence polarization studies (dos Remedios et al.  1972a ,  b ). Later, fluorescence and spin polarization probes were introduced to a specific cysteine, SH1, in the motor domain. This was possible because SH1 is most reactive of all myosin cysteines (Sekine and Kielly  1964 ) and indeed of all proteins in skinned muscle fibers (Borejdo and Putnam  1977 ), and therefore could be selectively labeled. Unfortunately, it later became known that the SH1-labeled myosin does not function as a motor (Root and Reisler  1992 ; Marriott and Heidecker  1996 ; Bobkov et al.  1997 ). Extensive muscle fiber X-ray diffraction studies were performed but no clear evidence for cross-bridge movement was obtained. In the light of numerous spectroscopic and structural studies, the massive part of an actin-bound myosin head proximal to actin was suggested to remain unchanged during the powerstroke, whereas the distal neck region with smaller mass than the proximal one was suggested to change its orientation (Cooke  1986 ). In this case it would be difficult to distinctly detect this change in the fiber diffraction patterns. Moreover, the time in which a myosin head interacts with an actin is very short in the ATPase cycle, making it difficult to record the dynamics of cross-bridges. The molecular structures of myosin heads in different nucleotide conditions were successfully revealed at submolecular level using electron microscopy (e.g., Walker and Trinick  1988 ; Katayama  1989 ; Pollard et al.  1993 ; Takács et al.  2010 ) and at the atomic level using X-ray crystallography (e.g., Rayment et al.  1993a ; Fisher et al.  1995 ; Dominguez et al.  1998 ; Houdusse et al.  2000 ). However, as a matter of course, these structures were static snapshots. Moreover, even with the current state of technology, it is still difficult to obtain the atomic structure of actin-bound myosin head, particularly the structure in the power-stroking state (Rayment et al.  1993b ; Lorenz and Holmes  2010 ). In vitro motility assays To overcome some of the above adversities, experimental techniques called in vitro motility assays were developed in the early 1980s, as advanced versions of previous methods developed in the 1970s (Oplatka and Tirosh  1973 ; Kuroda and Kamiya  1975 ). Dark-field microscopy was performed that detected the movement of fibrils that were squeezed out of the giant alga  Nitella  cell, washed with buffer, and mixed with ATP (Higashi-Fujime  1980 ). Next, fluorescence microscopy was conducted using a more purified system where skeletal myosin-coated fluorescent beads were observed to slide on a substratum of polar arrays of actin cables derived from giant alga,  Nitella  (Fig.  4a ) (Sheetz and Spudich  1983 ). The movement was ATP-dependent and blocked by inactivation of the myosin heads using N-ethylmaleimide. This study revealed that the bipolar thick filament structure is not necessary for generating force and movement. Remarkably, this assay system was much simpler and more robust than previous in vitro motility assay systems (Oplatka and Tirosh  1973 ; Kuroda and Kamiya  1975 ; Higashi-Fujime  1980 ; Yano et al.  1982 ), and this facilitated quantitative analyses of the myosin motility. Using fluorescently labeled single actin filaments, their thermal bending motion was observed to increase in the presence of HMM and ATP (Yanagida et al.  1984 ). Also was demonstrated that the sliding movement of individual actin filaments on myosin-coated surfaces occurred at velocities similar to those recorded in muscles (Fig.  4b ) (Spudich et al.  1985 ). Moreover, actin filaments were observed to slide on one-headed myosin filaments, indicating that a two-headed structure is not needed for motility (Harada et al.  1987 ). This result was reinforced by the observation of actin filaments gliding over myosin S1-coated surfaces (Toyoshima et al.  1987 ). Thus, motor activity inherent in the head was established, which ruled out some models of muscle contraction. Fig. 4 Schematics showing in vitro motility assay systems for actomyosin.  a  Myosin-coated bead assay. The myosin-coated fluorescent beads are subjected to the polar arrays of actin cables naturally formed on chloroplastd of the alga  Nitella , and movement of the beads are observed under a florescent microscope.  b  Actin filament gliding assay. Myosin molecules are attached to the surface of a nitrocellulose-coated coverslip and gliding motion of the fluorescently labeled actin filaments are observed under a fluorescence microscope 
 In vitro motility studies on chemo-mechanical relationship Understanding how actomyosin ATPase kinetics determines the mechanical performance of this motor system (magnitude of generated force and sliding velocity) became a central focus of muscle research. Even in the in vitro motility assays, single actin filament sliding and the translational motion of myosin-coated beads are propelled by multiple myosin heads. Therefore, the chemo-mechanical relationship was not straightforward. Nonetheless, the in vitro motility assays made the analysis more precise and more extensive than previous assays where muscle fibers were studied. The in vitro motility assays allowed us to investigate actomyosin motility under wide varieties of solution conditions with myosins and actins from diverse species and cell types. The velocity of actin filament sliding over myosin-coated surfaces and the velocity of myosin-coated beads along actin filaments were shown to be analogous to the speed of unloaded shortening of muscle fibers (Sheetz et al.  1984 ; Spudich et al.  1985 ; Kron and Spudich  1986 ; Homsher et al.  1992 ). Despite the reported analogy, many studies using different types of myosin II found no direct correlation between the steady-state actomyosin ATPase activity and the rate of movement measured by the in vitro motility assays (Umemoto et al.  1989 ; Lowey et al.  1993 ; Uyeda et al.  1994 ; Vale et al.  1984 ; Higashi-Fujime  1991 ). Nor was direct correlation observed using different nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs) condition (Shimizu et al.  1991 ; Higashi-Fujime and Hozumi  1996 ). In these studies, one concentration of actin and one concentration of NTPs were used in the measurements of the enzymatic activities. In similar studies where the actin concentration was varied and a fixed concentration of NTPs was used, a moderate correlation was shown between the motor activity and the substrate turnover rate (Pate et al.  1993a ; Regnier et al.  1998 ). A more extensive study was conducted for rabbit skeletal acto-HMM using six naturally occurring NTPs with Mg 2+ , different divalent cations with ATP, and Mg 2+ -ATP at various ionic strengths (Amitani et al.  2001 ). The maximum substrate turnover rates ( V 
 max ),  K 
 m  for actin ( K 
 m A ), and  K 
 m  for metal 2+ -NTPs ( K 
 m N ) were obtained while the velocity of actin filament gliding on HMM-coated surfaces was measured under the same buffer and substrate conditions used for the measurements of substrate turnover rate. A large dataset acquired revealed a direct linear relationship, except when different divalent cations were used with ATP. The maximum sliding velocity ( V 
 s max ) extrapolated to the infinite concentration of substrates was directly proportional to ( V 
 max 
 K 
 m A ) 1/2  (Fig.  5 ). This experimental correlation was analyzed based on a force–balance model, where the average sliding force (active force) produced by a productive head, &lt; f 
 s &gt;, is balanced with the average resistive force produced by an actin-bound non-productive head, &lt; f 
 r &gt;, which is directly proportional to the gliding velocity of the actin filament. At infinite substrate concentration, &lt; f 
 s &gt; equals  pT 
 p / T 
 c , where  p  is the magnitude of powerstroke (force spike),  T 
 p  is the duration of single powerstroke, and  T 
 c  is the substrate turnover time. The power stroke speed ( d / T 
 p ; where  d  is actin filament displacement by each powerstroke) should equal the maximum sliding velocity ( V 
 s max ) (Uyeda et al.  1991 ). Thus, the following relationship is derived: 1 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

 As the fraction of the resistive state λ is likely to be proportional to  k 
 + ,  V 
 s max  becomes directly proportional to ( V 
 max 
 K 
 m A ) 1/2 , which agrees well with the experimentally observed relationship (Fig.  5 ). The lifetime of the weakly bound state is very short but this state occurs many times within a substrate turnover cycle. Thus, the weakly bound state becomes a predominant resistive state. This force balance model could also be extended to the case where actin filaments moved at various substrate concentrations by including the resistive force produced by rigor heads; thus, it could derive the dependence of sliding velocity on the substrate concentration. Its derivation showed that the dependence of the sliding velocity on the substrate concentration [S] followed a modified Michaelis–Menten equation of  V 
 s  =  V 
 s max /{1 + ( K 
 m N /[S]) n } (here, 1 &lt; n &lt; 2), which again agreed well with the experimentally obtained dependence under various conditions (Amitani et al.  2001 ). Step size The next fundamental question to tackle experimentally was the translocation distance that is propelled by actin—myosin interaction during an ATPase cycle (i.e. step size). The swinging lever-arm hypothesis predicts the size to be ∼10 nm. However, as mentioned above, the in vitro actin gliding or myosin-bead gliding assay is not a single-molecule assay. Moreover, the duration of the working stroke that occurs in an ATPase cycle has to be measured to estimate the step size but cannot be measured directly. Consequently, various values were reported for the step size: ∼8 nm (Toyoshima et al.  1990 ), ∼10 nm (Pate et al.  1993b ), 10–28 nm (Uyeda et al.  1991 ), and &gt;60 nm (Yanagida et al.  1985 ; Harada et al.  1990 ). To resolve this large discrepancy, the step size had to be directly measured at nanometer and millisecond spatiotemporal resolution. This requirement gave birth to the so-called “single-molecule measurement assays” capable of observing and manipulating single biological molecules in action. Single-molecule measurements Optical tweezers are typically used in single molecule measurements. A micrometer-sized dielectric particle such as a polystyrene bead is trapped by a focused laser beam (Ashkin and Dziedzic  1985 ; Neuman and Block  2004 ) and a trapped particle can be freely moved by changing the focal position of the laser beam. The position of the trapped particle in the XY plane perpendicular to the laser beam can be measured with ±&lt;1 nm precision. For the trapped particle, the focused laser beam works as a 3D spring with a spring constant of 0.01–10 pN/nm. When the particle is displaced by an external force in the XY plane, the magnitude of the external force applied can therefore be measured at high precision. This optical trap nanometry is now routinely used to study biological molecules (Svoboda and Block  1994 ; Mehta et al.  1998 ; Wang  1999 ; Bustamante et al.  2000 ; Kuo  2001 ). Step size and the force produced by a single myosin head were directly measured using a dual-beam laser trap (Finer et al.  1994 ; Molloy et al.  1995 ; Guilford et al.  1997 ; Tanaka et al.  1998 ; Veigel et al.  1999 ). Each end of an actin filament was attached to a particle. The two particles are caught in the dual-beam laser trap, and then the actin filament is allowed to interact with a single myosin molecule immobilized on a surface (Fig.  6a ). The measured step size ranged between 3.5 and 15 nm but the extent of discrepancy between laboratories was much smaller than previous estimates made using actin gliding assays. It was pointed out by Yanagida’s group that the measured step size tended to be affected by the interaction angle between myosin and actin. With careful design, the measured step size was shown to be dependent on the interaction angle (Tanaka et al.  1998 ). When an actin filament was aligned parallel with a myosin filament with a low myosin head density, a relatively large step size of 10–15 nm was obtained (Tanaka et al.  1998 ). Fig. 6 Schematics showing typical single-molecule measurement systems for studying myosin–actin interactions.  a  Dual-beam laser trap assay. Each end of an actin filament is attached to a plastic bead, and the beads are trapped by the focused laser beams. The trapped actin filament is brought to a single myosin molecule attached to a silica bead.  b  Mechanical measurement system with the use of a thin glass micro-needle as a force sensor. A ZnO crystal whisker is attached to the end of a glass micro-needle (not shown in this schematic). Fluorescently labeled single myosin S-1 is attached to the apex of the ZnO crystal whisker via a specific binding of biotin-streptavidin. The tip is brought onto actin bundles formed by α-actinin. The displacements of the S-1 resulting from the interaction with actin are monitored by the detection of glass micro-needle deflection.  c  TIRFM experiment for visualizing individual ATP turnovers by single myosin S-1. The light chain of S-1 molecule is labeled with Cy5 (indicated by the  red star ) for the confirmation of whether or not the observed ATP turnovers are those by a single S-1 molecule. Once Cy3-ATP binds to the S-1, the large Brownian motion of the Cy3-ATP stops and therefore its fluorescent spot becomes visible.  d  Single beam assay for the measurement of unbinding force of a single myosin–actin bond.  e  AFM measurement of rupture force and rupture distance of a single actin–myosin bond 
 A very fine glass micro-needle was also used by Yanagida’s group as a force transducer for single molecule mechanical measurements. A single actin filament was attached to the free end of a micro-needle and brought into contact with an immobilized single myosin molecule. The displacement of the micro-needle caused by the myosin–actin interaction was measured (Kishino and Yanagida  1988 ; Ishijima et al.  1991 ; Ishijima et al.  1996 ). Using a low needle stiffness (0.09 pN nm −1 ) and near zero load, the average of single displacement spikes was ∼20 nm (Ishijima et al.  1996 ). However, the spatiotemporal resolution was not high enough to precisely detect the displacement spikes. Then, an experimental system was further developed (Fig.  6b ); a ZnO crystal whisker with a tip radius of ∼15 nm was attached to a fine glass needle mounted on a three-dimensional piezoelectric actuator. A single myosin S-1 fluorescently labeled at the regulatory light chain was attached to the end of the ZnO whisker. The molecule was brought into contact with actin bundles formed by chicken gizzard α-actinin, where the actin filaments were aligned in anti-parallel (Meyer and Aebi  1990 ). Using a glass needle with very small stiffness (0.01–0.03 pN nm −1 ), the spatial resolution of 2.0 nm and the temporal resolution of &lt;0.2 ms were obtained (Kitamura et al.  1999 ,  2005 ). Using this technique, an average step size of ∼13 nm was measured, but surprisingly several (2–5) 5.5-nm successive substeps were also detected within each step. This size, 5.5 nm, coincides with the distance between adjacent actin monomers in a filament. More surprisingly, the dwell between substeps was independent of the ATP concentration (0.1 and 1 μM). Therefore, it was concluded that the multiple substeps produced by a single myosin head occurred during just one cycle of ATP hydrolysis. This conclusion was reinforced by theoretical studies (Terada et al.  2002 ; Takano et al.  2010 ). However, the experimental result has never been reported by other groups. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) has also been used for single-molecule measurements (Park et al.  2007 ; Murcia et al.  2007 ; Joo et al.  2008 ). When an incident laser light is totally reflected at the glass–water interface, an evanescent field is generated that decays exponentially from the interface, penetrating to a depth of ∼100 nm into the solution. Since only fluorophores located in the evanescent field are excited, the background light level is very low, allowing the visualization of single fluorophores (Fig.  6c ). Using a Cy3-labeled ATP, the dynamic events of its binding to and dissociation from single myosin S-1 molecules were visualized (Funatsu et al.  1995 ). The dissociation rate estimated from the lifetime of the bound Cy3-nucleotide agreed with the biochemically measured rate of Cy3-ATP turnover by S-1. This success opened up a new opportunity to simultaneously measure the chemical and mechanical events in single myosin molecules. Using one-headed skeletal muscle myosin assembled with myosin rod and a setup where TIRFM and a dual-beam laser trap were combined, mechanical events of actin–myosin dissociation/force generation (displacement) and chemical events of binding/dissociation of Cy3-ATP (or Cy3-ADP) were simultaneously observed (Ishijima et al.  1998 ). The timing of Cy3-ATP binding well coincided with the timing of myosin head dissociation from actin. However, in more than 50 % of 85 detected events, the actin filament was displaced 0.3–1.8 s after the dissociation of Cy3-nucleotide from the myosin head. This surprising result suggested that myosin has a hysteresis or memory state in which the chemical energy liberated by ATP hydrolysis is stored even after ADP dissociation. However, photobleaching of bound Cy3-nucleotide also looks like it is dissociated from the myosin head. Therefore, their interpretation could not be statistically verified. The step size measured in this study (∼15 nm) was consistent with their previously reported values. Single-molecule measurements quantified other mechanical properties of actin, myosin, and their interactions. The tensile and torsional rigidity of a single actin filament was determined using a glass micro-needle technique (Kishino and Yanagida  1988 ) and optical tweezers (Tsuda et al.  1996 ), respectively. The unbinding force between an actin filament and a single myosin head in the nucleotide-free condition was ∼9 pN using an optical tweezers method where an actin filament was pulled approximately along its length (Fig.  6d ) (Nishizaka et al.  1995 ). It was also measured to be ∼15 pN with AFM, where a single myosin head was pulled in the direction perpendicular to the actin filament (Fig.  6e ) (Nakajima et al.  1997 ). As described above, no complete consensus was reached among research groups regarding the myosin step size taken for each ATP hydrolysis, and hence also as to the swinging lever hypothesis. The discrepancy was due partly to a relatively small step size occurring in a short time that was technically difficult to measure. Myosin V The technical difficulty mentioned above was significantly removed by the discovery of M5 that possesses unique structural and biochemical features. M5 is involved in organelle and mRNA transports as well as in membrane trafficking. Its cellular functions and regulations are well described elsewhere (Reck-Peterson et al.  2000 ; Taylor  2007 ; Sellers and Knight  2007 ; Sellers and Weisman  2008 ), so here we focus on its motor mechanism. Structural and biochemical features of M5 The most prominent structural feature of two-headed M5 is its neck domain (∼24 nm) (Cheney et al.  1993 ) which is approximately three-fold longer than that of myosin II (∼8 nm). If M5 really follows the swinging lever-arm hypothesis, a step size markedly larger than that of muscle myosin II should be observed. M5 was biochemically shown to dominate in a high actin-affinity state (ADP-bound state) during its ATPase cycle (De La Cruz et al.  1999 ), in stark contrast with muscle myosin II where a weak affinity sate (ADP–Pi-bound state) dominates. Processive movement A dual-beam optical trap was used to show that a suspended actin filament successively moved 3–6 times when it interacted with a single M5 molecule attached onto a bead (Mehta et al.  1999 ). The dwell time depended on the ATP concentration, and therefore, successive step movements differed from the sub-stepping observed previously with myosin II (Kitamura et al.  1999 ,  2005 ). This was the first evidence that M5 is a processive motor. Importantly, the step size was ∼36 nm, consistent with the swinging lever-arm hypothesis. A much longer processive run (over several microns) of single M5 molecules along surface-immobilized actin filaments was demonstrated with TIRFM (Sakamoto et al.  2000 ). In a single-beam optical trap, a trapped bead coated with M5 at low density moved processively with ∼36-nm steps along a surface-immobilized actin filament (Rief et al.  2000 ). The ∼36-nm step size corresponds to the head-head distance shown in electron micrographs of M5 with two heads bound to the same actin filament (Walker et al.  2000 ). From dwell time analyses of the data, the stepping kinetics was shown to be limited by ADP release. In this study, a hand-over-hand model was first proposed, i.e. the two heads alternately switch the leading and trailing positions in every ATPase cycle. The processivity is consistent with the cellular functions of M5 (e.g., organelle transports). The motility of kinesin, a cargo-carrying microtubule-based processive motor, has been well characterized although its step size is relatively small (∼8 nm) (Vale et al.  1985 ; Block  2007 ; Hirokawa et al.  2009 ). M5 possesses both processivity and a large step size, which were of great advantage in studying details of how M5 moves. Inhibitory state of M5 In one of the above studies on the full length of M5 (Sakamoto et al.  2000 ), the ATP turnover rate was measured biochemically under the same buffer solution conditions (without Ca 2+ ) used for the observation of long processive movement. From the maximum actin-activated ATPase rate measured (∼1.2 s −1 /head) and the maximum velocity of M5 movement observed with TRIFM (1 μm s −1 ), M5 appeared to travel ∼400 nm per ATPase cycle. This long travel distance implied that a large fraction of M5 (more than 90 %) would be in a catalytically inhibited or low-activity state. Any M5 not in this state would have a much higher ATPase activity (14 s −1 /head). Interestingly, in previous studies an ATPase rate as high as 14 s −1 /head was reported for single-headed M5 constructs in the absence of Ca 2+  (De La Cruz et al.  1999 ; Trybus et al.  1999 ) as well as for the full length of M5 in the presence of μM Ca 2+  (Nascimento et al.  1996 ). Later, this mystery of the fast movement (1 μm s −1 ) with a low ATPase activity (∼1.2 s −1 /head) was solved by a finding that M5 often takes a folded conformational state in the absence of Ca 2+ , in which the C-terminal cargo-binding domains bind to the heads, resulting in the inhibition of the ATPase and motor activities (Wang et al.  2004 ; Krementsov et al.  2004 ; Li et al.  2006 ; Liu et al.  2006 ; Thirumurugan et al.  2006 ; Olivares et al.  2006 ). Also, several other myosins such as myosin VII and X are now known to be regulated by head–tail interactions (Yang et al.  2009 ; Umeki et al.  2009 ,  2011 ). Intramolecular folding appears to be a common mechanism to inhibit the activity of motor proteins as a similar conformational transition was shown previously with smooth muscle myosin (Trybus et al.  1982 ) and kinesin (Hackney et al.  1992 ). However, a recent study of smooth muscle myosin suggests that an intramolecular interaction between the heads would be a key event in the regulation, rather than a head–tail interaction (Baumann et al.  2012 ). Processive hand-over-hand movement The ∼36-nm step size of M5 corresponds to the long pitch pseudo-repeat of the actin helix, suggesting that M5 moves on a plane along an actin filament. This inference was certainly proven to be the case by the observation of the movement of an M5-attached bead on a suspended actin filament. The bead advanced in a left-handed spiral trajectory with one revolution per 2.3 μm, i.e. only 5.6° rotation per step (Ali et al.  2002 ). The next study to be done was to confirm the tight relationship between the neck length and the step size, using M5 constructs with different neck lengths. It was actually confirmed that the step size is directly proportional to the neck length (Purcell et al.  2002 ; Sakamoto et al.  2003 ; Moore et al.  2004 ; Sakamoto et al.  2005 ). Thus, the swinging lever-arm hypothesis was nearly secured. Next, many studies focused on the experimental verification and close inspection of the hand-over-hand movement previously proposed (Rief et al.  2000 ). To this end, various light microscopy techniques or fluorescent probes were introduced to TIRFM: fluorescence imaging with one nanometer accuracy (FIONA) (Yildiz et al.  2003 ), fluorescence polarization (Forkey et al.  2003 ), two-color imaging with Q-dots (Warshaw et al.  2005 ), single-molecule high-resolution colocalization of fluorescent dyes (Churchman et al.  2005 ), a combination of FIONA and fluorescence polarization (Syed et al.  2006 ), and defocused orientation and position imaging (Toprak et al.  2006 ). All these studies revealed that in fact M5 walks in a hand-over-hand manner. Not only translational position changes of the two heads but also angular changes of the lever-arm relative to actin were observed where only one of the two lever-arms was labeled with a fluorescent probe. The value of the angle change (∼60°) was also consistent with a hand-over-hand movement (Forkey et al.  2003 ; Syed et al.  2006 ; Toprak et al.  2006 ). These studies supported the hand-over-hand model but only the dwell states were observed when both heads were bound to actin. Therefore, little was known about the fleeting intermediate between the dwell states because the time resolution was low (∼33 ms or longer). To increase the time resolution to 1 ms or less, the following imaging methods were employed: dark field imaging of a 40-nm gold nanoparticle attached to one of the lever-arms (Dunn and Spudich  2007 ) and recording of light-scattering from a 200-nm M5-coated latex bead traveling in an interference fringe pattern (Cappello et al.  2007 ). Alternatively, the action of walking M5 was slowed down by attaching a large fluorescent microtubule to one of the lever-arms and observed by conventional fluorescence microscopy (Shiroguchi and Kinosita  2007 ). All three studies revealed that the detached head underwent extensive rotational Brownian motion before landing on a site ahead of the leading head, suggesting that the detached head is unlikely to interact with actin during the Brownian motion. Moreover, it was suggested that the Brownian motion is likely to be biased forward by the orientational change (swing) of the actin-bound leading head, by which the detached head eventually finds an actin ahead of the leading head to become a new leading head. Thus, a clearer picture of the processive hand-over-hand movement was obtained. Asymmetry of enzymatic kinetics between two heads The processive hand-over-hand movement suggests that only the trailing head can detach from actin. If so, there are two possibilities: (Case 1) ADP dissociation followed by ATP binding predominantly occurs at the trailing head, so that the ADP dissociation would be accelerated at the trailing head or retarded at the leading head; (Case 2) the ATP-binding rate would be enhanced at the trailing head or suppressed at the leading head. Between these possibilities, Case 1 appeared more likely as the ATPase rate is limited at the ADP release step. In either case, the kinetics asymmetry between the two heads would be engendered by head-to-head communications through intramolecular strain. This kinetics asymmetry was addressed by solution kinetics studies and optical-trap nanometry studies. In the solution kinetics studies various kinetics constants were compared for S-1 and HMM constructs of M5, although the two heads of M5-HMM do not necessarily interact with the same actin filament in solution (Rosenfeld and Sweeney  2004 ; Forgacs et al.  2008 ). These studies suggested retardation of ADP release from the leading head by ∼45-fold (Rosenfeld and Sweeney  2004 ) or up to 250-fold (Forgacs et al.  2008 ). The latter study used new fluorescent ADP and ATP analogues (deac-aminoADP and deac-aminoATP) (Webb et al.  2004 ) whose emission intensity increases by 20-fold upon binding to the active site of M5 (Forgacs et al.  2006 ). In the dual-beam trap experiments, the actin filament that was interacting with a surface-attached single-headed M5 molecule was pulled forward or backward to apply a force to the actin-bound head (Purcell et al.  2005 ; Veigel et al.  2002 ,  2005 ). The forward and backward forces were hypothesized to simulate forces experienced by the trailing or the leading head, respectively. Different designs of optical trap nanometry were also used to study the coordination between actin-bound two heads (Uemura et al.  2004 ; Clemen et al.  2005 ; Gebhardt et al.  2006 ; Oguchi et al.  2008 ). Most of these studies suggested that the intramolecular strain would coordinate two heads by decelerating ADP release from the leading head, whereas some studies suggested accelerated ADP release at the trailing head (Veigel et al.  2002 ,  2005 ), as proposed by a study of processive run of M5 perturbed by varying the nucleotide content (Baker et al.  2004 ). In two-headed bound M5, the neck of the trailing head takes the arrowhead orientation, whereas the neck of the leading head takes the reverse arrowhead orientation. The leading head conformation must be mechanically distorted because single-headed M5 binds to an actin filament in an arrowhead orientation. In fact, electron micrographs of two-headed bound M5 showed that the leading neck was curved slightly outwards whereas the trailing neck was straight (Walker et al.  2000 ; Burgess et al.  2002 ; Oke et al.  2010 ). This conformational distortion seems consistent with the suggestion that the coordination of M5 stepping is performed by strain-mediated inhibition of ADP release from the leading head. Finally, using two-color TIRFM, Sakamoto et al. ( 2008 ) simultaneously observed the stepping motion of fluorescently labeled M5 and the binding and dissociation of the fluorescent nucleotide (deac-aminoADP or deac-aminoATP). This observation directly revealed the preferential ADP dissociation from the trailing head, which was followed by a ∼36-nm step triggered by ATP binding. It also revealed that every M5 molecule always keeps at least one nucleotide (ADP in the leading head) during its stepping, even at low ATP concentrations. Discrepancies and unsolved questions in myosin V motility The above description suggests there is now a consensus on how M5 steps. In every ATP hydrolysis cycle, the leading head swings to propel M5 forwards by ∼36 nm (Sakamoto et al.  2008 ). This large stride is realized by the long lever-arms of M5 (Purcell et al.  2002 ; Sakamoto et al.  2003 ; Moore et al.  2004 ; Sakamoto et al.  2005 ). The two heads alternately switch between the leading and trailing roles so that M5 walks hand-over-hand (Yildiz et al.  2003 ; Forkey et al.  2003 ; Warshaw et al.  2005 ; Churchman et al.  2005 ; Syed et al.  2006 ; Toprak et al.  2006 ). This style of movement is made possible by the intramolecular strain-mediated retardation of ADP release from the leading head (Rosenfeld and Sweeney  2004 ; Purcell et al.  2005 ; Forgacs et al.  2008 ; Oguchi et al.  2008 ; Sakamoto et al.  2008 ). Nonetheless, several observations that are difficult to reconcile with this generally agreed view have been reported, mostly from the Yanagida lab. A recombinant two-headed M5 with a single IQ motif on each neck (∼4 nm long) was reported to move processively with ∼36-nm steps (Tanaka et al.  2002 ). It was claimed that the long-neck domain was not essential for both large step size and processivity of M5 but the motor domain alone determined the processivity and the large step size. It was also reported that single-headed M5 constructs underwent multiple successive large (∼32-nm) steps on an actin filament suspended by a dual-beam optical trap (Watanabe et al.  2004 ). They also underwent directional diffusion on surface-immobilized actin bundles with ∼5.5-nm substeps to develop an average displacement of ∼20 nm, which was independent of the neck length (2IQ and 6IQ motifs) (Okada et al.  2007 ), as previously observed with single-headed myosin II (Kitamura et al.  1999 ). Likewise, myosin VI with its short neck similar to myosin II, was reported to move with ∼36-nm steps (Rock et al.  2001 ; Nishikawa et al.  2002 ). However, among these reported irreconcilable conclusions, only the large step size of myosin VI was resolved. The SAHs were found in the proximal tail domain of myosin VI, which contribute to the lever-arm length (Baboolal et al.  2009 ; Spudich and Sivaramakrishnan  2010 ; Sweeney and Houdusse  2010b ). The other discrepant results are still incomprehensible (Cyranoski  2000 ; Geeves  2002 ). Even if the above general view of how M5 steps is completely right, there remain fundamental questions to solve. How is the chemical energy liberated by ATP hydrolysis used to generate the tension for forward movement? How are the tension generation and lever-arm swing coupled to the ATPase cycle? If they are coupled, which chemical transitions are involved in these mechanical events? These fundamental questions have long been explored in muscle contraction studies and some are considered to be resolved. Are there any inconsistencies when this consensus view is applied to the motility of M5? Numerous single-molecule measurements of M5 stepping have not answered these important questions. The discrepancies mentioned above, as well as the remaining unsolved fundamental questions, have certainly proven that the level of “directness of measurement” is not yet high enough even with single-molecule optical measurements. Proteins molecules themselves are indeed invisible in these measurements, which can never be overcome even with diffraction-breaking super-resolution fluorescence microscopy (Egner and Hell  2005 ; Huang et al.  2009 ). HS-AFM HS-AFM has overcome this technical limitation. Biological molecules can be directly observed at sub-molecular spatial and sub-100 ms temporal resolution without disturbing their function. In this section, we briefly summarize the principle of AFM and the current state of HS-AFM performance (Fig.  7 ). Techniques involved in the HS-AFM instrument are well described elsewhere (Ando et al.  2001 ; Ando et al.  2008 ; Ando  2012 ). See other reviews for protocols of HS-AFM imaging of protein molecules (Uchihashi et al.  2012 ) and various application studies of HS-AFM (Ando et al.  2014 ). Fig. 7 Schematic of HS-AFM system. The system includes an original inverted optical microscope. The objective lens with a long working distance that is a part of the OBD detector is also used to view the cantilever and sample stage via a digital camera. The glass slide, to which the cantilever holder and the liquid cell are attached, is placed on the optical microscope stage. A cantilever chip is held in the holder so that its tip points upward (opposite to the way in conventional AFM). The sample stage, attached to the Z-scanner and facing downward, is placed over the cantilever. An incident laser beam passing through the objective lens is focused onto the small cantilever, and the light reflected back from the cantilever is collected and collimated by the same objective lens and guided to the quadrant-cell Si PIN photodiode. The incident and reflected laser beams are separated using the quarter-wavelength (λ/4) plate and the polarization beam splitter. A cantilever immersed in a buffer solution is oscillated with small amplitude (1–2 nm) by the excitation with an excitation piezo at the first resonant frequency of the cantilever (0.6–1.2 MHz in water). The cantilever oscillation amplitude is maintained constant by feedback control. A counterbalancing method is employed to the Z-scanner to minimize unwanted vibrations; two peazoactuators are attached to the supporting base at its counter sides and simultaneously displaced in the same distance, in the counter directions. The scan signals for the X- and Y-scanner are output from the computer through the DA converters. The output from the active Q-control damper is recorded as the sample height through the AD converter. The active Q-control damper is constructed with an LRC circuit whose transfer function is very similar to that of the Z-scanner. Its electrical output behaves in a way similar to the Z-scanner displacement 
 Principles of AFM imaging In AFM (Binnig et al.  1986 ), a sharp tip attached to the free end of a cantilever traces the sample to acquire its surface topography while the sample stage is scanned laterally. AFM can observe any object on a substrate at single-nanometer (or higher) resolution under a wide range of environments (vacuum, air, and liquids). Topography images of biological samples can be acquired under physiological buffer conditions, without fixing, staining and labeling the sample (Engel and Müller  2000 ; Müller and Dufrêne  2008 ). Among various imaging modes, the tapping mode (Zhong et al.  1993 ) is most suited for biological samples. In this mode, the cantilever is excited to oscillate in the Z-direction at or near its first resonant frequency. Because of this oscillation, the cantilever tip is brought intermittently into contact with the sample surface, which can eliminate lateral friction force and hence minimize deformation of fragile samples. The reduction of cantilever oscillation amplitude upon tip-sample contact is measured and then the sample stage is finally moved in the Z-direction to restore the amplitude to its set point using a feedback control. This series of operations is repeated many times for different sample surface points during lateral scanning of the sample stage. Consequently, the 3D movement of the sample stage approximately traces the sample surface, and hence, a topography image of the sample can be constructed from the electric signal used to drive the scanner in the Z-direction. Current state of HS-AFM With conventional AFM instruments it takes at least 30 s to capture an image. This slow rate is due mainly to the slow response of the mechanical devices (i.e. cantilevers and Z-scanner), whereas many interesting biological phenomena occur much faster. Various efforts have been made to markedly increase the imaging rate of tapping-mode AFM over the past 20 years. Small cantilevers, fast scanners, and fast amplitude detectors were developed to build the first prototypic instruments (Viani et al.  2000 ; Ando et al.  2001 ). The improvement of these devices and creation of new techniques for vibration damping and fast feedback control produced the current HS-AFM (Ando et al.  2008 ). The highest possible imaging rate is a function of the speed of an AFM instrument as well as the imaging conditions and the sample fragility (Uchihashi et al.  2012 ; Ando et al.  2013 ). For 50- to 200-nm scan ranges, sufficient to image biological molecules, HS-AFM can capture an image within 30–80 ms without disturbing their biological function. The spatial resolution of HS-AFM is now comparable with that of conventional slow AFM even with high-bandwidth detection of the cantilever oscillation amplitude and fast scanning of the sample stage (∼2 nm for XY and ∼0.1 nm for Z in the best case). HS-AFM has already visualized dynamic biomolecular phenomena (see reviews in Ando  2012 ; Ando et al.  2013 ,  2014 ) and even dynamic phenomena in live cells (Yamashita et al.  2012 ; Watanabe et al.  2013 ). Walking M5 filmed by high-speed AFM Substrate surface and observation of unidirectional movement M5-HMM was directly imaged walking along actin filaments using HS-AFM (Kodera et al.  2010 ). Here, partially biotinylated actin filaments were immobilized on a surface where streptavidin was dispersed at low density on mica-supported planar lipid bilayer containing electrically neutral phospholipids and a biotinylated lipid (Fig.  8a ). M5-HMM was never bound directly to the lipid bilayer surface and only interacted with the immobilized actin filaments and moved thereon. The moving M5 was frequently oriented perpendicular to the substrate surface so that its characteristic lateral topography was only occasionally observed. Adding a positively charged lipid to the bilayer solved this problem.

 In the presence of 1–2 μM ATP, successive AFM images captured at 7 fps clearly showed M5-HMM moving processively with discrete ∼36-nm steps (Fig.  8b ). The two-headed bound M5-HMM exhibited unique structural features (Fig.  8c ). The junction of the neck with the motor domain appears smooth in the leading head but is always V-shaped in the trailing head because the neck regions emerge from different parts of the motor domain. The short coiled-coil tail was mostly tilted towards the minus end of actin. These structural features, which are totally consistent with an electron microscopic observation (Burgess et al.  2002 ), can be used to determine the actin polarity when bound M5-HMM is stationary. In addition, the leading head always assumed a straight conformation (slightly curved outwards), which agreed with the straight-neck model proposed for walking M5 (Forkey et al.  2003 ; Syed et al.  2006 ; Toprak et al.  2006 ) but disagreed with the bent-neck model (Walker et al.  2000 ; Burgess et al.  2002 ; Snyder et al.  2004 ; Oke et al.  2010 ). The positively charged lipid in the lipid bilayer slightly retarded the translocation velocities. When it was absent, the velocities at various ATP concentrations were similar to those measured by fluorescence microscopy under the same buffer solution condition (Forkey et al.  2003 ; Baker et al.  2004 ), indicating negligible effects of the tip-sample interaction on the motor activity. However, molecular behavior during a step could not be resolved as it completed very fast. Visualization of stepping behavior To slow the step, more streptavidin molecules were placed on the lipid bilayer surface as moderate obstacles to the walking of M5-HMM (Fig.  9a ), which resolved the stepping process (Fig.  9b ). Upon detachment of the trailing head from actin, the leading head appeared to spontaneously rotate from the reverse arrowhead orientation towards the arrowhead orientation. Before completing this rotation, the leading head was halted for a moment by colliding with a streptavidin molecule placed on the way of its natural path. In this halt state, the detached trailing head was displaced forward, positioned most distant from the actin filament (thus, the two heads were aligned nearly straight, pointing opposite directions), and slightly rotated around the neck-neck junction (the second frame in Fig.  9b ). Then, the leading head overcame the obstacle and further rotated forwards. Immediately after this the trailing head bound to a forward site of the actin filament to become a new leading head, completing one step. Thus, dynamic processes in the forward step were directly visualized. The observed rotation of the leading head is exactly the swinging lever-arm motion itself initially proposed for the powerstroke of muscle myosin (Huxley  1969 ). Note that before completing a step the detached trailing head never interacted with actin but passively moved forwards driven by the rotating leading head. This ruled out some models of M5 motility such as the ‘inchworm’-like model considered for kinesin (Hua et al.  2002 ) and the “biased diffusion” model proposed for single-headed myosin II (Kitamura et al.  1999 ) and single-headed M5 (Okada et al.  2007 ). M5 strictly followed the hand-over-hand mechanism. In contrast, the other processive myosins VI and X, which function not only as a cargo transporter but also as a structural anchor in cells, were reported to move irregularly, namely inchworm-like stepping, backward stepping, and forward hand-over-hand stepping (Yildiz et al.  2004 ; Sun et al.  2007 ; Nishikawa et al.  2010 ; Ricca and Rock  2010 ; Sun et al.  2010 ).

 Foot stomp and unwinding of coiled-coil tail Interestingly, in the two-headed bound state during the dwell, the motor domain of the leading head frequently exhibited brief dissociation and reassociation on the same actin filament, while the molecule remained at approximately the same position on the filament (Fig.  10a ). Similarly, the motor domain of the trailing head exhibited a brief translocation by ∼±5 nm along the actin filament. We termed these behaviors “foot stomp”. The foot stomp was more frequently observed at the leading head than at the trailing head (by a ratio of approximately 3:1). Although not well documented, a foot-stomp-like behavior was previously suggested in fluorescence microscopy observations of walking M5 molecules (Syed et al.  2006 ; Shiroguchi and Kinosita  2007 ). More recently, the foot stomp was further confirmed by the observation of walking M5 by high-speed single-molecule polarized fluorescence microscopy (Beausang et al.  2013 ). Thus, the foot stomp is an inherent behavior of this motor. Fig. 10 Unique molecular behaviors of M5-HMM visualized by HS-AFM.  a  Successive HS-AFM images showing a foot stomp event that occurred at the leading-head (ATP, 1 μM; frame rate, 7 fps; scan area, 150 × 75 nm 2  with 80 × 40 pixels;  scale bar  50 nm).

 The foot stomp at the leading head raises an important question as to the chemo-mechanical coupling in M5. The briefly detached leading head does not carry bound Pi because Pi has already been released from the leading head following its initial attachment to actin (De La Cruz et al.  1999 ; Olivares et al.  2006 ). Nevertheless, the detached leading head with its bound ADP reattached to actin while still in the reverse arrowhead orientation. It then swung forward following trailing head detachment. This fact was important because it indicated that tension generation for forward movement can occur without transitioning through the ADP–Pi bound state, i.e. it can occur directly in the ADP–bound state. Thus, the tension generation for forward movement does not seem to require chemical energy be supplied by ATP hydrolysis. The asymmetry of foot stomp frequency between the two heads suggested their actin-affinity difference, consistent with a biochemically measured result (Olivares et al.  2006 ). The leading head binds to actin in the unnatural orientation (i.e. reverse arrowhead orientation), and hence, pays an energy cost by distorting the neck conformation, resulting in a lower affinity for actin. The distortion of the leading head is likely to be the source for tension generation for forward movement. This was reinforced by the following observation; when the two-heads were bound to actin in 1 mM ADP, the short coiled-coil tail was sometimes unwound, immediately after which the monomerized leading head rotated towards the arrowhead orientation, similar to the swinging lever-arm motion observed when M5-HMM was walking forwards (Fig.  10b ). Flexibility of neck-motor domain junction Under nucleotide-free conditions, the leading head frequently exhibited a sharply bent conformation (Fig.  10c ) that was never observed in the presence of ATP or in the presence of 1 mM ADP. This bent conformation suggested that the neck-motor domain junction is less flexible in the nucleotide-free head than in the nucleotide-bound head. To examine this issue, the arrowhead orientation angle of single-headed M5 relative to the actin filament was measured under the nucleotide-free and ADP-bound conditions. In nucleotide-free solution, the angle was ∼34°, whereas in ADP the angle was distributed widely, peaked at ∼29° and ∼51° in the proportion of approximately 6 to 1 (supplementary data in Kodera et al.  2010 ), which may be relevant to the two different ADP-bound states in equilibrium as reported for myosin II (Geeves  1989 ; Geeves and Holmes  1999 ), M5 (Robblee et al.  2005 ; Hannemann et al.  2005 ; Oguchi et al.  2008 ; Jacobs et al.  2011 ), and myosin VI (Robblee et al.  2005 ). Therefore, ADP binding to the head makes the hinge of the neck–motor domain junction flexible. Because of the rigid hinge of the nucleotide-free head, the leading neck in the reverse arrowhead orientation tends to be sharply bent to release the large strain accumulated therein. This rigid hinge was also supported by the observation that both heads are rarely bound to adjacent actin subunits but only in the nucleotide-free condition (Fig.  10d ). In the electron micrographs of actomyosin II and actomyosin VI complexes, this conformation was frequently seen, suggesting they have rigid hinges (Craig et al.  1980 ; Nishikawa et al.  2002 ). The flexibility of the neck-motor domain junction observed for the actin-bound M5 head with ADP does not seem sufficient to account for the two-headed binding in ADP because the leading head binding in the reverse-arrowhead orientation requires the junction to bend by at least ∼60°, even when the contribution of the neck domain’s flexibility is considered. This apparently restricted flexibility suggests that the actin-unbound head with ADP is more flexible than the actin-bound one. In the other words, actin binding may make the neck-motor domain junction less flexible. This plausible flexibility change seems an excellent strategy for facilitating both actin binding and the generation of enough tension to execute a powerstroke. Very recently, such an actin-binding effect on the flexibility was proposed for muscle myosin (Billington et al.  2014 ). Asymmetry of ADP dissociation rate The straight and sharply bent conformations of the leading head depend on the presence or absence of bound ADP, respectively, meaning that one can judge whether or not the leading head contains ADP by just looking at its conformation. From the proportion and lifetime of the straight conformation as a function of ADP concentration, the rate constants of ADP binding/dissociation kinetics at the leading head were estimated. The ADP dissociation rate constant was 0.1 s −1 , i.e. one ADP is released from the leading head every 10 s, on average. However, M5 walks many steps during 10 s. Thus, from the structural point of view, it was confirmed that the sequential events of ADP release, the subsequent ATP binding and the resulting head dissociation take place solely at the trailing head, which is the basis for the processive hand-over-hand movement (Rosenfeld and Sweeney  2004 ; Purcell et al.  2005 ; Veigel et al.  2005 ; Forgacs et al.  2008 ; Oguchi et al.  2008 ; Sakamoto et al.  2008 ). New questions The swinging lever-arm hypothesis is no longer a hypothesis. HS-AFM visualized its occurrence with irrefutable clearness. However, from HS-AFM observations of M5-HMM interacting with actin, questions were raised about the chemo-mechanical coupling in this motor as well as myosin motors in general. The prevailing coupling mechanism had been modeled in the context of swinging lever-arm motion (Fig.  3 ). In this model, the structural states are putatively tightly coupled to the nucleotide states of the motor domain (Fig.  3 ). In the M–ADP–Pi state, the head takes the pre-powerstroke conformation caused by recovery stroke of the lever-arm, which facilitates binding of the head to actin in the reverse arrowhead orientation. Coupled to Pi release from the actin-bound head, the intramolecular tension is considered to be generated just once by the pre-powerstroke to post-powerstroke transition. However, the observation with HS-AFM of walking M5-HMM showed that the tension responsible for the lever-arm swing can be generated directly by the ADP-bound leading head (after foot stomping). In addition, it was shown that two-headed bound M5-HMM with ADP alone can generate sufficient tension to cause occasional unwinding of the short coiled-coil tail, after which the lever-arm swings. Thus, the recovery stroke or the pre-powerstroke conformation thought to occur uniquely in the ADP–Pi-bound head does not seem necessary for its binding to actin and lever-arm swing. More seriously, the chemical energy liberated by ATP hydrolysis does not seem to be used for the processes of recovery stroke, tension generation, and lever-arm swing, suggesting that M5 would step forward without chemical energy input once the trailing head detaches from actin. This new idea of “no chemical energy usage” in these processes would, however, inevitably lead us to encounter a “perpetuum mobile problem”. Even in ADP or in the nucleotide-free condition, foot stomp occurs at both leading and trailing heads of two-headed bound M5-HMM, with a higher frequency in the leading head than in the trailing head. When the trailing head detaches from actin, the molecule takes a forward step by the spontaneous swing of the leading head. On the other hand, when the leading head detaches from actin, the molecule cannot take a backward step because the trailing head is bound to actin in a stable orientation (i.e. the arrowhead orientation). Thus, using only thermal energy, M5 would step forward many times (albeit very slowly), even with less frequent occurrence of foot stomps at the trailing head. This is a forbidden perpetuum motion. However, in this  gedankenexperiment , positional fluctuations of the single-headed bound molecule due to the flexible neck-motor domain junction are not considered. Taking this into account, we can expect a backward step after detachment of the leading head from actin, albeit with a low probability. The ratio of foot stomp occurrence between the leading and trailing heads was observed to be 4:1 in the presence of 1 mM ADP. However, the foot stomp events at the trailing head mostly occurred as a brief ±5-nm translocation. Therefore, when this brief translocation is omitted and only the events of brief detachment from actin are counted as foot stomp, the ratio of foot stomp occurrence between the two heads becomes much larger. Thus, the principle of detailed balance holds between the forward step after trailing head detachment and the backward step after leading head detachment, resulting in no net movement of the molecule. From numerous X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy studies, there is no doubt that myosin changes its conformation upon binding nucleotides and takes a pre-powerstroke-like conformation in the ADP–Pi-bound state (Fisher et al.  1995 ; Smith and Rayment  1996 ; Dominguez et al.  1998 ; Houdusse et al.  2000 ; Burgess et al.  2002 ; Coureux et al.  2004 ; Volkmann et al.  2005 ). These static structures have been used to construct the prevailing model of the chemo-mechanical coupling (Fig.  3 ) assuming there is a tight one-to-one relationship between the chemical and conformational states. In reality, the relationship is not so tight. Myosin takes two (or multiple) conformations even under a given nucleotide condition. They can go back and forth but the dynamic equilibrium is biased to one side depending on the nucleotide condition. The HS-AFM observations of M5-HMM indicates that structural fluctuations indeed exist and therefore two-headed binding occurs even in the ADP-bound and nucleotide free conditions, consistent with other studies (Walker et al.  2000 ; Rosenfeld and Sweeney  2004 ; Olivares et al.  2006 ). The flexibility of myosin head conformation raises a question whether the chemical energy of ATP hydrolysis is really used to change the conformation. In the prevailing view, the myosin head with a strained (tension-generating) conformation in the pre-powerstroke state is achieved using the chemical energy of ATP, which is finally released by the swinging lever arm motion. However, the pre-powerstroke and post-powerstroke conformations are in dynamic equilibrium with no marked energy barrier. Thus, one can conclude as follows: although the conformational change of myosin head caused by recovery stroke is an effective strategy for facilitating its binding to actin in the reverse arrowhead orientation, the energy required for producing a pre-powerstroke conformation and the tension-generating state is much less than that to be liberated by ATP hydrolysis. Therefore, the conformational change can occur thermally without chemical energy input. At first glance this new view seems inconsistent with the recent report (Shiroguchi et al.  2011 ) in which the energy barrier between the pre-powerstroke state conformation (formed immediately after ATP addition) and post-powerstroke conformation (formed in the absence of nucleotides) was estimated to be 5.2  k 
 B 
 T  ( k 
 B , Bolzmann constant;  T , room temperature in Kelvin). For this estimation, they monitored the angular distributions of a large bead duplex attached to the motor domain of a single-headed M5 construct, while the molecule was immobilized to a surface of a 50-nm bead by the neck region. This estimated energy barrier seems too large to be achieved thermally. However, the angle distribution measurement did not include the contribution of the flexible neck region to the angle fluctuations, because the neck region was attached to a surface. If it was included, the energy barrier could be smaller. Moreover, the observed angular distributions only reflect projections in the image plane. Therefore, the distributions are underestimated and hence the energy barrier is overestimated. In fact, from solution kinetics measurements of muscle myosin ATPase reaction, the free energy change in the recovery stroke-involved transition from M–ATP to M–ADP–Pi is estimated to be 2  k 
 B T (Howard  2001 ). Moreover, the attachment of a large bead duplex to the head would significantly impede the otherwise frequent thermal transitions between the pre-powerstroke and post-powerstroke states. Let us perform another  gedankenexperiment  in the presence of ADP alone. Suppose each head of M5 is labeled with a chromophore. Upon light absorption, the chromophore on the bound head will alter its conformation so that it dissociates from actin. When a light pulse is illuminated only at the trailing head of the bound M5, it spontaneously steps forward after detachment of the trailing head. By repeated light illumination only at the trailing head, the molecule would move for a long distance unidirectionally. It seems plausible that a large fraction of the chemical energy liberated by ATP hydrolysis is used elsewhere and could be used to detach the actin-bound nucleotide-free head from actin. How much energy is required? As mentioned in “ Single-molecule measurements ”, the unbinding (rupture) force was previously measured to be ∼15 pN by AFM (Nakajima et al.  1997 ). The rupture distance was also estimated to be 1.7–2.5 nm in this study. This distance is unusually long compared to 0.23 nm for antigen–antibody (Hinterdorfer et al.  1996 ), 0.15–0.3 nm for streptavidin–biotin (Yuan et al.  2000 ), and 0.05–0.3 nm for α-actinin–actin (Miyata et al.  1996 ). However, it is consistent with the fact that actin–myosin interfaces contain several bonds formed by flexible loops (Milligan  1996 ; Kabsch et al.  1990 ). From the values of rupture force and rupture distance, the energy required to rupture the actin–myosin rigor bond is 6–9  k 
 B 
 T , which is 30–45 % of the chemical energy of ATP hydrolysis (∼20  k 
 B 
 T ). This mechanically estimated value is approximately consistent with the values of 9 and 10  k 
 B 
 T  estimated biochemically for the free energy changes in the dissociation A–M → A + M and the ATP-induced dissociation A–M + T → A + M–T, respectively (Howard  2001 ). One may argue against this statement. For instance, ATP is not yet hydrolyzed in the actin–myosin dissociation step, and hence the energy of ATP is not yet liberated in this step. However, the account balance of energy should be considered for the whole cycle of the ATPase reaction. Therefore, unlike chemical cleavage reactions, in the enzyme-catalyzed reaction cycle the ATP-binding energy can be used as a large part of the energy liberated by ATP hydrolysis. The role of the sequential ATPase reaction process after ATP binding and head dissociation from actin would lie in ensuring the unidirectional progression of the mechanical process. For this assurance, only a small fraction of ATP energy, comparable to thermal energy, is sufficient. Conclusions We have shown how our understanding of the myosin motor mechanism has advanced with increasing level of directness of measurement. When the level of directness is low, arguments can continue without resolution. For example, in the efforts to provide evidence for or against the swinging lever-arm hypothesis, experimental data on the structure and dynamic behavior of myosin were obtained separately. Detailed but static structural data have often given the impression that there is a tight relationship between structural and chemical states. The single-molecule biophysical studies of the dynamic behavior of myosin, on the other hand, have revealed a subset of dynamic molecular events that depends on where the optical probe is placed, and hence other subsets are missed. Therefore, constructing models for the myosin motor mechanism on this basis is reminiscent of a jigsaw puzzle with missing pieces that have to be filled by speculation and hypotheses. Directly observing the structural dynamics and dynamic processes of M5-HMM by HS-AFM has significantly reduced the missing parts and revealed a picture that appears similar to but is largely different from that envisaged previously. Surprisingly, it revealed that generation of tension responsible for forward movement and the following lever-arm swing can occur without through the ADP–Pi bound state and therefore the mechanical events do not require the input of chemical energy. Thus, the chemical energy of ATP is mainly used for the detachment of the trailing head from actin. Once detached, the forward swing of the leading head and the resulting forward step of the molecule occur spontaneously without chemical energy input. Of course, this issue of energy usage by M5 should be further corroborated in more direct ways. Moreover, this new principle of energy usage needs to be confirmed for other myosin motors as well as for other mechano-enzymes. This important task remains to be accomplished. </Body>

    <Body>Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is rapidly becoming a leading player in structural biology, while X-ray crystallography still prevails as a powerful traditional tool for studying 3D structures of proteins (Fig.  1 ). The Taiwan-Japan joint symposium on structural biology using X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM, chaired by myself and Prof. Ken Yokoyama from Kyoto Sangyo University, was held as a session in the BSJ meeting in Miyazaki Japan in the afternoon of 25th September 2019. In this symposium, six researchers from Taiwan and Japan presented cutting-edge results using the two methods as described below. Fig. 1 Structure and function of a bacterial V-ATPase. Left: crystal structures of V 1  part and V o -c ring. Center: Cryo-EM structure of a whole V-ATPase complex. Right: Schematic model of the V-ATPase. The V1 part is composed of a hexameric arrangement of alternating A and B subunits responsible for ATP binding and hydrolysis. The Vo part, in which rotational energy is converted to drive H +  (or Na + ) translocation, is composed of oligomers of the c subunits and an a subunit. The V1 and Vo parts are connected by a central stalk, which is composed of D, F, and d subunits, and two peripheral stalks, which are composed of E and G subunits of V1. ATP hydrolysis induces the rotation of the central stalk (DFd complex) and an attached c ring, which causes ion pumping at the interface between the c ring and a subunit The first speaker was Prof. Masahide Kikkawa from the University of Tokyo, who talked about cryo-EM analysis of cilia and microtubule-based motor proteins. Prof. Kikkawa and his group knocked-out efcab1 in zebrafish, encoding calaxin, and found that the mutant zebrafish have situs inversus due to the irregular ciliary beating of Kuppfer’s vesicle cilia (Sasaki et al.  2019 ), and also analyzed a complex between dynein microtubule binding domain and microtubule using high-resolution cryo-EM. Form these findings, he proposed a bound-unbound switching mechanism of the motor protein. The next speaker was Dr. Shang-Te Danny Hsu from Academia Sinica, who talked about cryo-EM analysis of a feline coronavirus spike protein. Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) is an alphacoronavirus that causes nearly 100% mortality rate without effective treatments. Dr. Hsu and his colleagues have solved a 3.3 Å cryo-EM structure of an FIPV spike protein, responsible for host recognition and viral entry (Yang et al.  2020 ). In his talk, he presented an insight inspired by the EM structure for a better molecular understanding of the pathogenesis of FIP. The third speaker was Dr. Kuen-Phon Wu from Academia Sinica, who talked about cryo-EM studies of bacterial glutamine synthetase. Bacterial glutamine synthetase (GS) is a dodecameric enzyme which responds in cellular glutamine biosynthesis as well as nitrogen fixation. Dr. Wu and his colleagues have determined the structures of GS in the catalytic cascade by cryo-EM at 2.6 Å resolution. He presented the new structures and a possible mechanism of recruiting magnesium, consuming ATP, and converting glutamine from glutamate. The fourth speaker was Prof. Jun-ichi Kishikawa from Kyoto Sangyo University, who talked about single-particle analysis of membrane-embedded domain V o  of V-ATPase. V-ATPases are composed of hydrophilic V 1  and membrane-embedded V o  (Fig.  1 ). The atomic structures of the V 1  part and a rotational mechanism inspired by the structures have already been elucidated under the condition of the V o  structure missing (Arai et al.  2013 ). The group of Profs. Kishikawa and Yokoyama have solved the cryo-EM structures of a whole V-ATPase complex from  Thermus thermophilus  at low to middle resolution (Nakanishi et al.  2018 ). Recently, they have succeeded in solving the cryo-EM structure of the V o  part at a higher resolution. In his talk, he presented a new structure of V o  and proposed that the V o  part adopts an autoinhibited form when V 1  dissociates from V o . The fifth speaker was prof. Kazuhiro Abe from Nagoya University, who talked about the transport mechanism of the gastric proton pump, H + ,K + -ATPase, which is responsible for acidifying the gastric juice up to pH 1 and thus an important drug target for treating gastric acid-related diseases. Prof. Abe and his colleagues have solved the crystal structures of the H + ,K + -ATPase in two different conformations (Abe et al.  2018 ). In his talk, he presented these cryo-EM structures and discussed the reasons why the pump is able to fulfill the requirements for the generation of a million-fold proton gradient across the membrane. The last speaker was Prof. Hui-Chih Hung from National Chung-Hsing University, who talked about p53 function regulated by PAD4 through protein citrullination. Peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4)-catalyzed citrullination has been shown to play an emerging role as a potential cancer therapeutic target (Liu et al.  2017 ). Prof. Hung and her group have elucidated that p53 protein can be citrullinated by PAD4 in vitro and in the cell. Structural and functional analysis demonstrated that citrullination has detrimental effects on p53 tetramerization and thus impairs their DNA-binding ability. In her talk, she presented direct evidence of the PAD4-p53 interaction and proposed a potential mechanism of how PAD4 involves in p53 target gene regulation by citrullinating p53. </Body>

    <Title>Biophysical Reviews—the IUPAB journal tasked with advancing biophysics</Title>

    <Body>Although accompanied by some uncertainty, 2021 has nevertheless sprung upon us. As we collectively welcome the new year, we concomitantly open a new volume (Volume 13) of Biophysical Reviews. At this time, it is appropriate to recall that the “Biophysical Reviews” journal was founded by the International Union for Pure and Applied Biophysics (IUPAB) in 2009 as a means for assisting with its philanthropic goals of promoting biophysics related research and education through international collaboration. Along with IUPAC (International Union for Pure and Applied Chemistry), IUPAB is one of the more than forty foundational unions that make up the International Science Council (ISC)—the largest non-governmental advocacy body for the promotion and funding of scientific research and the implementation of science-based decision making in public policy. For those not familiar with both the ISC and IUPAB, more can be read about them at the following websites: ISC:  https://council.science/about-us/ IUPAB:  http://iupab.org/ Through its starting IUPAB mandate, Biophysical Reviews is tasked with the following: (i) Publication, by experts in the field, of topical review articles in the general fields of biophysics, structural biology, and molecular biology (ii) Promotion of biophysics as a discipline by assisting with biophysical education, research, and international collaboration Issue 1 fulfils these IUPAB-constituted duties by containing within it  eight quality reviews, an outline of IUPAB’s activities for 2021, the biography of a member of the Biophysical Reviews’ Editorial Board, and the announcement of the results of an international competition for young biophysicists (organized and sponsored by the journal). As with every other, the first duty of this Editorial is to provide a summary of the published contents. Following this description, this Editorial then goes on to describe the nature of the 2021 Michèle Auger Award for Young Scientists’ Independent Research - before announcing the winner. Description of issue contents Directly after this Editorial (Hall  2021 ) is the latest instalment of the Biophysical Reviews’ ‘Meet the Editors Series’ (Vassalli  2021 ). In beginning, this biographical endeavor the journal placed its focus on the five Executive Editors (Olson  2020 ; Nagayama  2020 ; Itri  2020 ; Ho  2020 ; Jagannathan  2020 ). After this initial foray, we then started with members of the Editorial Board (Benedetto  2020 ). This Issue's contribution by Dr. Massimo Vassalli, from the University of Glasgow, is scientifically intriguing. Describing his research progression over a career spanning fields as diverse as theoretical physics and the mechanobiology of cells; it is clear that Dr. Vassalli has both an interesting personal and research story to tell. After reading this piece, one appreciates that the journal is lucky to have him as a member of its Editorial Board (Vassalli  2021 ). The next article in the front matter section is a Commentary by Prof. Juan-Carmelo Gomez-Fernandez (Gomez-Fernandez  2021 ). As the Secretary General of IUPAB, Prof. Gomez-Fernandez is one of the key executive members of the organization. In this commentary, he first breaks down how the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the activities of IUPAB in 2020, before next describing the planned IUPAB activities for 2021 and beyond (along with their contingencies in case of further disruption). The first review article (Daria et al.  2021 ) is concerned with the latest developments in the biophysical design and construction of neural networks. For the reader casually perusing this summary, I point out the atypical aspect of this Review being that these neural networks are not the computational structures associated with machine learning that we so often hear about, but rather the product of actual culturing and machine interfacing of neurons based on opto-genetic/opto-electronic transduction principles. After providing an overview of the biophysics of neurons in isolation and in collection (neuronal circuits), the Review by Daria et al. ( 2021 )discusses the current technical temporal and spatial limitations associated with both, analyzing, and manipulating information transfer in experiments involving individual neurons and neuronal arrays. With much scientific and popular interest in the machine brain interface, this review article provides a digestible introduction to the field along with an excellent presentation of the state-of-the-art and existing open questions. The second Review deals with the biophysical properties of a particular class of short peptides that exhibit cytotoxic antibacterial properties (Cardoso et al.  2021 ). Reviewing many demonstrated examples of such peptide-based antibacterial and antifungal activity in nature, the authors speculate how the targeted exploitation of this class of short peptide sequences proffers an avenue for the rational development of new classes of antibiotic and antifungal medicines. Particularly comprehensive in its approach, this article (Cardoso et al.  2021 ) reviews areas as diverse as models of lipid membrane disruption, the quaternary state dependence of the antimicrobial peptide’s bioactivity, and modern bioinformatics-assisted and experimental combinatorial chemistry-based approaches for enhancing peptide cytotoxicity. The third review article (Prabakaran et al.  2021 ) deals with the subject of quantitative modeling of protein aggregation. Due to its causative association with debilitating diseases such as type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer’s, along with the growing recognition of the role it plays as a fundamental regulator ofmany biochemical pathways, research into protein aggregation has proceeded apace over recent years. With the initial recognition of the peptide origin of amyloid (Eanes and Glenner  1968 ; Glenner et al.  1971 ; Glenner and Wong  1984 ), a great deal of research effort has been made to quantitatively describe the structural nature of the protein aggregate and the physical mechanism of its production and regulation, both in vitro, and in the cell (Rochet and Lansbury  2000 ; Greenwald and Riek  2010 ; Balchin et al.  2016 ; Fitzpatrick and Saibil  2019 ; Hirota et al.  2019 ). Indeed, different aspects of these topics have been popular subject areas for review within this journal. This Review by Prabakaran et al. ( 2021 ) differs from others in the field in that it takes a particularly practical approach by reviewing and benchmarking published methods for predictingif a particular peptide sequence will form an aggregate. One particularly remarkable result to emanate from this benchmarking effort was the authors’ finding that the predictive power of three highly cited (and utilized) methods for estimating amyloid formation propensity from unknown proteins (Chiti et al.  2003 ; DuBay et al.  2004 ; Tartaglia et al.  2005 ) all exhibited correlations in the range [−0.4, 0.4] (i.e., effectively none) when tested against more expansive benchmarked experimental data sets than those on which they were trained and developed (Table 5 (Prabakaran et al.  2021 )). Anotherinteresting area covered by this review article involved state-of-the-art approaches for increasing the speed, size, and accuracy (sometimes independently of each other) of molecular dynamics-based simulations. In a change of direction, the fourth review article of Issue 1 (Poillot et al.  2021 ) adopts a materials science/solid-state physics perspective to discuss structural deformations of collagen within human cartilage and the capacity of strain-induced deformations of this polymer to induce an electrical potential difference—a phenomenon relating to the piezoelectric effect. In reviewing this area, Poillot et al. ( 2021 ) first present the known physicochemical effectors of measured potential difference (and/or current flow) within the fluid/solid environment of cartilage placed under load. Breaking down the contributions associated with fluid flow and charged ion diffusion, the authors review the additional contributing role emanating from structural deformation of the collagen itself. Redistribution of the charged groups within the collagen (when the polymer is stretched) generates different local potential differences both along and perpendicular to the fiber axis with the chance for multiple contributions from many aligned and bundled fibers (with the degree of alignment also changing under load). Results of numerical modelling are presented and reinforced with discussion of experiments based on piezoresponse force microscopy—a modified atomic force microscopy that incorporates an alternating current applied through the cantilever and microscope tip (Poillot et al.  2021 ). The fifth review article within this Issue’s collection examines what is known about the structural biology of serotonin receptors (Sarkar et al.  2021 ). As an important member of the G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, serotonin receptors act as the chief transducer of the brain signaling chemical serotonin (also known as 5-hydroxy tryptamine, 5HT). Through collation and comparison of X-ray and cryoelectron microscopy–generated structures of various ligand-complexed and non-ligand-complexed serotonin receptors (both fragments and complete receptors inclusive of supporting lipid), the authors discuss potential avenues of drug development and comment on the likelihood of various current models of GPCR activity. The arguments made on the basis of structural data are extended through analysis of recent coarse grained molecular dynamics simulations made on serotonin receptors (Sarkar et al.  2021 ]. As serotonin is one of the chief modifiers of mood, this review article by Sarkar et al. ( 2021 ) provides a fascinating molecular insight into the way we think and feel. The sixth entry, from Sackmann and Tanaka, reviews the fundamental role of the lipid membrane in generating eukaryotic cell polarization and cell migration based on a crawling mechanism (Sackmann and Tanaka  2021 ). The review begins with an introduction of the two general modes of eukaryotic cell crawling based on either amoeboid movement (pseudopodial projection due to differential weakness in the membrane) or mesenchymal migration (actively driven by bundled actin fiber projection originating from within the cytosol). Focusing on the mesenchymal mode, thesubsequent exposition reviews lipid phase separation driven by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) enzyme–catalyzed conversion of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3). Introducing supporting evidence gained largely from reflection interference contrast microscopy (RICM) measurements, the authors discuss how this key lipid chemical transition results in membrane phase separation, followed by selective peripheral and integral protein localization that ultimately stimulates actin fiber polymerization and differential external protein attachment through stimulation of integrin activity. Introducing the downstream biochemical players in the cellular attachment and release oscillatory cycle, the authors do a very admirable job of making the complex subject of the cell's pulling and pushing events comprehensible, with the underlying physical chemistry not lost in an acronymsalad of pathway components (Sackmann and Tanaka  2021 ). The seventh contribution is a short review vignette that discusses the biochemical pathways directing tissue remodeling in varicose vein formation within the leg (Saberianpour et al.  2021 ). Dealing with the topic of mechanobiology, this review article describes the mechano-transduction principles (based on changes in the activity of integrins, ion channels, and G protein receptors) that translate changes in shear velocity and lateral pressure, occurring within the vein lumen, to cellular growth patterns in the surrounding vasculature.Describing how  downstream communication is carried out by changes in the expression of hypoxia inducible factors (HIF) and matrix metallopeptidases (MMP), this Review article discusses how the surrounding extracellular matrix can be modified to produce the varicose phenotype (Saberianpour et al.  2021 ). The final Review of Issue 1 is concerned with the topic of biocompatible ionic liquids (Le Donne and Bodo  2021 ). For those unfamiliar with the topic, the term ionic liquid is typically reserved for a special class of molten salts that are liquid below 100 °C. With the potential to be constructed from a plethora of different highly chemically substituted cations and anions (all relatively loosely held together by ionic bonds), the development of ionic liquids over the last 100 years has presented a novel solvent-based alternative for the rational design of chemical catalysts, with a design philosophy inherently different tosolid-state or enzymatic methodologies. In their article, Le Donne and Bodo ( 2021 ) review the development of a particular class of ionic liquids in which the cation chemistry is based on the cholinium ion ((2-hydroxyethyl)trimethylammonium), a chemical component naturally found within the human body. Treating issues relating to the synthesis, biocompatibility, and physical simulation of liquid structure, this article provides a fascinating insight into a potentially non-toxic range of ionic liquids with ‘tunable’ chemical properties. Winner of the Michèle Auger Award for Young Scientists’ Independent Research (2021) In late 2018, the journal lost a much admired editorial board member, Prof. Michèle Auger, to illness (IUPAB  2019 ). To commemorate Michèle’s association with the journal, Biophysical Reviews started a competition with the twin aims of honoring her memory and promoting some of the values that were important to her (described in Hall  2019 ). Conducted on a yearly basis, the award winner receives the following. (i) A year’s paid subscription to the journal (courtesy of Springer-Nature) (ii) An invitation from the journal to publish a single author review article on an aspect of their research work, with this Review containing a printed foreword on the life and research of Prof. Michèle Auger (iii) A personal plaque to keep in perpetuity along with their name and year of award printed on a memorial plaque kept by the principal officer of the journal Each year, a call for nominations for ‘The Michèle Auger Award for Young Scientists’ Independent Research’ is put out in the editorial of issue 3, with an entry deadline set for October 31 (Hall  2020a ). The requirement for nomination is that the young scientist be currently involved in biophysical research and be under 40 by the deadline of application. In 2020, the inaugural ‘Michèle Auger Award for Young Scientists’ Independent Research’ was conducted and this competition was won by Dr. Alexandra Zidovska, Assistant Professor at New York University (Hall  2020b ; Zidovska  2020 ). For the 2021 award, the journal received 15 nominations. Judging was carried out by a panel of sixteen judges. All judges were at the senior professor/head of school/head of institute level with twelve male and four female judges 1 . Each nominee was assessed according to three categories, (i) originality, (ii) independence, and (iii) scientific excellence. Scores were given from 1 (low) to 10 (high) and the winner was determined on the basis of a simple average of all scores (Fig.  1 ). The journal owes a great debt to members of the judging panel for their time spent in assessing the nominees’ papers and c.v. I would also like to express the journals’ thanks to the many scientists who nominated a junior colleague for this year’s award. The many sincere nomination letters also served to perpetuate the legacy of Prof. Auger. Fig. 1 Ordinal ranking of the 15 candidates for the ‘Michèle Auger Award for Young Scientists’ Independent Research’. Scores are presented as averages with error bars denoting plus or minus one standard error. Each contestant was assessed by a minimum of nine judges As with the previous year, this year’s scoring was very close. The winner of this year’s prize was Associate Professor Jorge Alegre-Cebollada. Jorge is a group leader at the National Institute of Cardiovascular Research (CNIC) in Madrid, Spain. More can be read about his research at his laboratory home page ( https://www.cnic.es/en/investigacion/molecular-mechanics-cardiovascular-system ). Jorge will soon receive a plaque and complementary journal subscription and is scheduled to publish his awarded review article (carrying a foreword on the life and research of Prof. Michèle Auger) as the lead article of volume 13 issue 4 (published mid-August 2021). On behalf of the journal, I would like to congratulate Assoc. Prof. Alegre-Cebollada. We look forward to learning more about him and his research later this year. Design of the Michèle Auger Award As scientists mature, we slowly become inured to the disappointments associated with not winning every grant/award we apply for, or having each paper we submit be accepted. However aside from the disappointment, sometimes (as in the case of grants, fellowships, or paper rejections), there can be real negative consequences associated with these ‘failures’ especially so for those at a relatively junior stage of their career. For competitions involving the description of the candidate’s original and unpublished future research ideas, there is a risk that fellow researchers within our field may be influenced by our future plans. Although the best institutions/associations try their hardest to guard against cases of unwanted idea dissemination, this is nevertheless a risk faced by those engaging in academic competition/grant application and only the most naïve scientists would be dismissive of this phenomena. On top of the dangers associated with such horizontal ‘research proposal’ transfer are additional problems that relate to what could be best described as stochasticity in judging quality. Too often research proposals written over several months may be sunk by lazy and unprofessional judging 2 . The final unappreciated (and often the most pressing) consequence of one’s failure in research competition is the loss of time. For young scientists, often running small laboratories with limited manpower, they are often solely responsible for both writing the grants/fellowship applications, as well as also performing the research and then writing the papers. In such circumstances, injudicious usage of time can have very real negative consequences for those participatingdown the research track. With deliberate consideration of these special risks for young scientists, the ‘Michèle Auger Award for Young Scientists’ Independent Research’ has been designed with the following four points in mind. (i) An a posteriori philosophy: By basing the judging on what each nominee has achieved to date, the approach is intentionally made to limit exposure of nascent and unpublished concepts to an anonymous audience. (ii) Simplest of entry procedures: Candidates can be either self-nominated or be nominated by a colleague. After nomination, they are requested to submit, via email, a one-page c.v. and their five best papers as pdf files. (iii) Judging quality: The number of independent and anonymous (to each other) judges is typically set at a large number (this year we had 16 with each candidate scored by a minimum of 9 judges). This is done to counteract the too-often encountered situation in academic assessment in which the standard error associated with scores derived from a panel of two or three judges is large enough to encompass the average score of nearly all the entries. (iv) Positive experience: Even without winning, each entrant benefits from having had their c.v. and best papers read by 16 of some of the world’s most eminent biophysical scientists—all active in research assessment and conference organization. Having such a direct method for having your research appreciated by those ata senior level has no down-side for entrants, whether they win or place within the runners-up pool. This competition will be run again in 2022 with the next call to be announced in the upcoming issue 3. Conclusions The coming year will, without doubt, present a range of difficult challenges for all.

    <Abstact>Heart failure is a life-threatening condition that carries a considerable emotional and socio-economic burden. As a result of the global increase in the ageing population, sedentary life-style, increased prevalence of risk factors, and improved survival from cardiovascular events, the incidence of heart failure will continue to rise. Despite the advances in current cardiovascular therapies, many patients are not suitable for or may not benefit from conventional treatments. Thus, more effective therapies are required. Transforming growth factor (TGF) β family of cytokines is involved in heart development and dys-regulated TGFβ signalling is commonly associated with fibrosis, aberrant angiogenesis and accelerated progression into heart failure. Therefore, a potential therapeutic pathway is to modulate TGFβ signalling; however, broad blockage of TGFβ signalling may cause unwanted side effects due to its pivotal role in tissue homeostasis. We found that leucine-rich α-2 glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) promotes blood vessel formation via regulating the context-dependent endothelial TGFβ signalling. This review will focus on the interaction between LRG1 and TGFβ signalling, their involvement in the pathogenesis of heart failure, and the potential for LRG1 to function as a novel therapeutic target.</Abstact>
    <Body>Introduction Heart failure is a progressive and chronic condition in which the heart is no longer able to circulate blood efficiently to meet the body’s demands (Johnson  2014 ). A wide range of conditions such as ischemic heart disease (IHD), hypertension, valvular heart disease, myocarditis, diabetes and cardiomyopathy can lead to heart failure (Nishimura et al.  2014 ). In response to stress or injury, the myocardium undergoes a series of pathological changes including structural rearrangement and morphological changes of cardiomyocytes, inflammation, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling, microvascular rarefaction and chamber dilation (Manabe et al.  2002 ; Kehat and Molkentin  2010 ). These changes cause further deterioration in cardiac function and eventually lead to heart failure (Cohn et al.  2000 ). Over the last few decades, the prevalence and incidence of heart failure continues to rise mainly due to the prolonged longevity, improved survival rate from other cardiovascular events (e.g., myocardial infarction, valvular disease, and arrhythmias), sedentary life style, and the increased prevalence of risk factors (e.g., hypertension, diabetes and obesity) (Mann DL  2012 ). In 2010, more than 41 million people lived with heart failure worldwide (Forouzanfar et al.  2013 ). Despite improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms and significant advances in treatment strategies, heart failure still carries substantial morbidity and mortality and its therapy remains a major unmet medical need. In this review, we summarise the current knowledge on the role of TGFβ1 and its novel modulator, LRG1, in different pathologies of cardiac remodelling and the potential of LRG1-targeted therapeutics for the treatment of heart failure. The challenges of current treatments for heart failure Heart failure is a heterogeneous disease with a broad spectrum of symptoms. Current treatments aim to alleviate symptoms, slow disease progression and thereby improve overall quality of life and survival. For example, IHD-induced heart failure, the most common type of the disease, is normally treated with antiplatelet drugs, anticoagulants and β-blockers. Emergent reperfusion via surgical or catheter-based revascularisation procedures is used to restore blood flow and improve survival following ischemic episodes (Heuser et al.  2000 ; Horvath  2000 ). However, a substantial portion of patients are not suitable for or do not benefit from conventional revascularisation treatments because of a poor overall health status or the presence of comorbidities (Norgren et al.  2007 ). Even in patients who received successful primary revascularisation, stent thrombosis and saphenous vein bypass graft disease can occur and cause recurrent myocardial ischemia and cardiac remodelling (Kaul et al.  1991 ). Furthermore, none of these treatments alters the natural history of heart failure and therefore offers no cure. Both human and animal studies have shown that individuals with robust collateral circulation and microvascular perfusion are associated with delayed myocardial cell death (Antoniucci et al.  2002 ), reduced occurrence of myocardial infarction (MI) (Choi et al.  2013 ), smaller infarction size (Habib et al.  1991 ) and increased survival (Meier et al.  2012 ). However, the capacity of collateral and capillary vessel remodelling under ischemic condition is highly variable among individuals. Accelerating this innate physiological response by exogenous angiogenic factors has been considered as an attractive approach to bypass occluded vessels, revascularise ischemic tissues and restore tissue function (Carmeliet and Jain  2011 ). An impressive body of pre-clinical evidence has demonstrated improved myocardial perfusion and function upon therapeutic angiogenesis in animal models (Harada et al.  1994 ; Unger et al.  1994 ; Landau et al.  1995 ; Lazarous et al.  1996 ; Shou et al.  1997 ; Lopez et al.  1998 ; Lee et al.  2000 ; Zhang et al.  2002 ; Cao et al.  2005 ; Heinl-Green et al.  2005 ; Cao  2009 ). Initial phase I clinical trials in patients with advanced IHD, but who did not meet the criteria for standard revascularisation strategies, have also demonstrated an improved cardiac circulation and function after being treated with pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (Losordo et al.  1998 ,  2002 ; Schumacher et al.  1998 ; Rosengart et al.  1999 ; Symes et al.  1999 ; Hendel et al.  2000 ; Udelson et al.  2000 ; Henry et al.  2001 ; Vale et al.  2001 ; Fortuin et al.  2003 ; Reilly et al.  2005 ). However, caution is needed in the interpretation of outcomes of these studies as most of them lack proper placebo controls. Not surprisingly, similar therapeutic efficacy has not yet been achieved in larger, placebo-controlled, late-stage clinical trials, which is partly due to the extent of angiogenesis observed in the placebo group (Grines et al.  2002 ,  2003 ; Simons et al.  2002 ; Kastrup et al.  2011 ). Angiogenesis is a tightly controlled process involving multiple levels of interactions between a wide variety of molecules, cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. It is now widely accepted that a single angiogenic factor may not be sufficient to induce the formation of functional vasculatures. Indeed, the treatment of VEGF leads to the formation of leaky, chaotic and tortuous vessels that lack the normal hierarchical structure (Nagy et al.  2007 ; Hedlund et al.  2009 ; Cao et al.  2010 ). Furthermore, both VEGF (Thurston  2002 ) and bFGF (Cuevas et al.  1991 ) are involved in vessel dilation and their treatment is associated with severe hypotension (Hariawala et al.  1996 ; Horowitz et al.  1997 ; Unger et al.  2000 ; Henry et al.  2001 ). In addition, there is evidence that VEGF exerts detrimental pro-atherogenic effects by influencing endothelial and immune cell function (Ross  1993 ; Inoue et al.  1998 ; Kim et al.  2001 ). A combination treatment targeting growth factors with complementary mechanisms might be more effective and has less unwanted side effects. ECM is essential for proper cardiac function. It provides a scaffold for different types of cells in myocardium and transmits mechanical force and signals to myocardial fibres (Banerjee et al.  2006 ). ECM remodelling is a critical step that allows the ordered replacement of damaged cells after injury. However, chronic inflammation and repetitive injury can cause disturbed ECM homeostasis and fibrosis, a feature shared by many conditions associated with heart failure (Weber et al.  1995 ). Cardiac fibrosis exaggerates mechanical stiffness of the myocardium and its vasculature, impairs myocyte contractility, disrupts electrical coupling, destroys normal tissue architecture and eventually leads to heart failure (Lopez et al.  2001 ; Ho et al.  2010 ; Karagueuzian  2011 ). Increasing evidence shows that fibrosis is a dynamic and reversible process (Iredale  2007 ). Targeting fibrosis, therefore, presents a promising strategy to prevent or slow down the deterioration of cardiac function. Despite its huge impact on cardiovascular diseases and intensive research efforts to explore new therapies, there is no approved treatment that directly targets the mechanisms of fibrosis in the heart. TGFβ1 and heart failure The TGFβ family of cytokines plays important roles in embryogenesis, tissue homeostasis and regeneration (Massague  2012 ). Their secretion, activation and function are tightly controlled by multiple mechanisms to ensure precise signal propagation (Fig.  1 ). TGFβs are secreted in latent form as part of a large protein complex (Khalil  1999 ) and their activation requires functional and physical cooperation of mannose-6-phosphate (M6P)/insulin-like growth factor II receptor (IGFIIR), urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (UPAR), Neuropilin 1 (NRP1) and different proteases and metalloproteases (MMPs) (Dennis and Rifkin  1991 ; Scott and Firth  2004 ; Glinka et al.  2011 ; Shi et al.  2011 ). Once released, TGFβs bind to type II receptor TGFβRII, which recruits type I receptor, activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) (Shi and Massague  2003 ), and activates a multitude of intracellular signalling including canonical Smad and non-canonical ERK, JNK, TAK1, P38 and Rho cascades (Derynck and Zhang  2003 ). TGFβs also interact extensively with other signalling pathways leading to very different even opposite outcomes (Massague  2012 ). Fig. 1 Schematic representation of TGFβ signalling and crosstalk with other signalling pathways. TGFβ ligands are synthesised as a large latent complex consisting of TGFβ dimmer covalently associated with a latency-associated peptide (LAP) and a latent TGFβ-binding protein (LTBP). The activation of latent TGFβ requires functional and physical cooperation of M6P/IGFIIR, UPAR, NRP1 and other proteases and MMPs. The released TGFβ dimers bind the type II TGFβ receptor (RII) first, which recruits and transphosphorylates the type I receptors (RI). RI propagates the signal into the cell by phosphorylating TGFβ receptor-regulated SMADs (R-Smads). They form heteromeric complexes with the common SMAD (co-Smad) and translocate to the nucleus. The R-Smads–co-Smad complex formation can be inhibited by inhibitory Smad (I-Smad). Once in the nucleus, the R-SMAD–co-SMAD complex associates with other DNA-binding transcription factors to modulate the expression of target genes. In the non-canonical pathways, the activated transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) receptor complex transmits a signal through other factors, such as TGFβ-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), RHO, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)–AKT, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), or JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK). TGFβ signalling interacts extensively with other pathways, such as the WNT, Notch, AngII, IGF and VEGF pathways, which defines the context-dependent TGFβ signalling 
 In mammals, there are three different isoforms: TGFβ1, TGFβ2, and TGFβ3. Each of them shows distinct expression pattern and functions. TGFβ1, the focus of this review, is the predominant and most ubiquitously expressed isoform (Millan et al.  1991 ). In the heart, TGFβ1 regulates the signalling and function of different types of cells, including endothelial cells (ECs), vascular mural cells (pericytes in capillaries and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in larger vessels), myofibroblasts, macrophages and cardiomyocytes (Bujak and Frangogiannis  2007 ; Koitabashi et al.  2011 ). Aberrant TGFβ1 signalling contributes to the development of a multitude of conditions associated with heart failure such as dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathies, post-infarction myocardial remodelling, valvular diseases and arrhythmia in both mice and humans (Cambien et al.  1996 ; Schultz Jel et al.  2002 ; Euler-Taimor and Heger  2006 ; Khan and Sheppard  2006 ; Kapur et al.  2013 ). TGFβ1 and cardiac fibrosis TGFβ1 is a potent fibrogenic factor that mediates ECM homeostasis through different mechanisms, for example, by inducing ECM (such as collagens and fibronectin) synthesis via both canonical and non-canonical signalling cascades (Chen et al.  2000 ; Qiao et al.  2005 ; Leask  2007 ), decreasing the production of proteinase regulating ECM degradation (such as MMPs), promoting the production of inhibitors of these proteases (such as TIMPs) (Biernacka et al.  2011 ) and promoting integrin expression to increase the adhesion of cells to matrix (Thannickal et al.  2003 ). Studies have shown that TGFβ1 signalling pathway components, including TGFβ1, ENG and Smads, are markedly up-regulated at the site of injury after MI (Hao et al.  1999 ; Krum et al.  2002 ; Dean et al.  2005 ; Kapur et al.  2012 ), in patients suffering from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Villarreal and Dillmann  1992 , Li et al.  1998 ) and dilated cardiomyopathy (Pauschinger et al.  1999 ; Sanderson et al.  2001 ), and all these conditions are characterised by excessive fibrosis in the heart. Consistently, TGFβ1 overexpression in transgenic mice leads to myocardial fibrosis (Rosenkranz et al.  2002 ; Seeland et al.  2002 ). Studies have shown that TGFβ1-mediated endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) also contributes to myocardial fibrosis (Zeisberg et al.  2007 ; van Meeteren and ten Dijke  2012 ). Recently, ENG, a previously considered EC specific TGFβ1 receptor, has been found to be expressed in cardiac fibroblasts and to mediate the pro-fibrotic effect of angiotensin II (AngII) via angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1) (Chen et al.  2004 ). Reduced ENG activity led to attenuated cardiac fibrosis and increased survival in an in vivo model of heart failure (Kapur et al.  2012 ). This study demonstrated that the expression of ENG is significantly up-regulated in human failing left ventricles. Inhibition of the activity of ENG-attenuated TGFβ1 induced Smad2/3 phosphorylation, ECM deposition and cardiac fibrosis.  Eng 
 +/−  mice with pressure overload-induced heart failure showed an increased capillary density in the heart, preserved cardiac function and improved survival. Thus, targeting the TGFβ1 signalling pathway might provide an attractive strategy to limit structural deterioration of myocardium and ultimately lead to improved cardiac function, and survival of heart failure patients. TGFβ1 and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy In addition to fibrosis, hypertrophic growth of cardiomyocytes occurs in response to haemodynamic overload and represents the heart’s effort to maintain cardiac output sufficient to meet the body’s demands (Glennon et al.  1995 ). There is compelling evidence that TGFβ1 plays a critical role in this process. Increased TGFβ1 expression is observed in the myocardium of human patients with idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Li et al.  1998 ). Consistently, TGFβ1 overexpression in transgenic mice results in hypertrophic growth of cardiomyocytes (Rosenkranz et al.  2002 ). Interestingly, this TGFβ1-induced cardiac hypertrophy is associated with increased myocardial β-adrenergic receptors (ARs) density (Rosenkranz et al.  2002 ) and β-AR blockade treatment in TGFβ1 transgenic mice prevents cardiac hypertrophy. On the other hand, angiotensin II was shown to induce TGFβ1 expression in myocardium and TGFβ1 (Wenzel et al.  2001 ) is required for AngII-mediated cardiacmocyte hypertrophy (Gray et al.  1998 ). However, the AT1 receptor blockade is insufficient to prevent the hypertrophic response in TGFβ transgenic mice (Rosenkranz et al.  2003 ), and TGFβ1 knockout mice are resistant to AngII-induced cardiac hypertrophy (Schultz Jel et al.  2002 ). Together, these data show that TGFβ1 plays a key role in AngII-mediated growth responses of cardiomyocytes via β-AR. TGFβ1 and post-infarction inflammatory response Cardiomyocyte death and hypoxia following infarction initiate inflammatory response, which leads to the infiltration of immune cells into the infarcted area, an important process for clearing debris from the wound and tissue repair (Mehta and Li  1999 ). In the meantime, a timely repression of inflammatory mediator synthesis is important for scar maturation. TGFβ1 plays a highly important and complex role in inflammatory response following cardiac injury (Celada and Maki  1992 ), It acts as a direct chemoattractant to monocytes (Wahl et al.  1987 ) and neutrophils (Fava et al.  1991 ) to recruit them to the infarct site. However, its effects on macrophages are primarily inhibitory (Frangogiannis et al.  2001 ). There is a need for a better understanding of the TGFβ1-modulated post-infarction inflammatory response for specific intervention that could attenuate inflammatory injury without interfering with myocardial healing. TGFβ1 and cardiac neovascularisation Genetic studies in mouse and human revealed that proper TGFβ1 signalling is essential for blood vessel formation (Chang et al.  2001 ; Harradine and Akhurst  2006 ). The vascular response to TGFβ1 is highly context-dependent and is shaped by factors such as ligand bioavailability and concentration, receptor availability and internalization, cross-talk with other signalling pathways, micro/marcovessel origin of vascular cells, and cellular density (Massague  2012 ). Although not fully understood, it is generally considered that TGFβ1 signalling in ECs occurs through TGFβRII recruiting either the ubiquitously expressed ALK5 or the EC-specific ALK1 (possibly with ALK5). Signalling via ALK5 leads to the activation of downstream transcription factors Smad 2 and 3, and thus plays an essential role in maintaining the vasculature at quiescent state. The TGFβ1/ALK1 signalling activates Smad 1, 5 and 8, resulting in increased EC migration, proliferation and angiogenesis (Goumans et al.  2003 ). The two pathways interact with each other at both receptor and the Smad level (Goumans et al.  2003 ), with ENG as a key player in switching TGFβ signalling toward the pro-angiogenic pathway (Lebrin et al.  2004 ). This paper showed that ENG regulates the balance of TGFβ signalling in endothelial cells by promoting TGFβ/ALK1 and inhibiting TGFβ/ALK5 signalling, and the subsequence endothelial proliferation. Besides ECs, blood vessels comprise another essential component. The vascular mural cells support endothelium and are involved in blood vessel maturation and homeostasis. Similar to that in ECs, TGFβ1 mediates the proliferation of VSMC in a dose-dependent manner with high-dose being inhibitory and low-dose being stimulatory (Seay et al.  2005 ; Tsai et al.  2009 ). TGFβ1 induces the contractile phenotype of VSMCs by promoting the expression of α-smooth muscle actin and smooth muscle myosin (Hautmann et al.  1997 ; Seay et al.  2005 ). Perturbed TGFβ1 signalling results in failure of VSMC recruitment (Pardali et al.  2010 ) and the formation of aneurysm (Choudhary et al.  2009 ). TGFβ1 also stimulates the expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1, a potent inhibitor of matrix MMPs, and therefore promotes blood vessel maturation by preventing the degradation of provisional matrix surrounding the nascent vessel (Jain  2003 ). On the other hand, the juxtaposition and collaboration between mural cells and ECs are important for local activation of latent TGFβ1, which further defines its context-dependent signalling in vascular cells (Antonelliorlidge et al.  1989 ; Sato et al.  1990 ). Together, extensive investigations have shown that TGFβ1 modulates the signalling and function of different vascular cells and participates in multiple stages of blood vessel development, which makes it an attractive target for therapeutic angiogenesis. Indeed, it has been reported that exogenous application of TGFβ1 stimulates blood vessel formation in peripheral circulation (van Royen et al.  2002 ). This study showed that exogenous TGFβ1 promotes peripheral collateral artery formation and collateral circulation in rabbit hind limb model of femoral artery occlusion, partly by increasing monocyte adhesion and transmigration and enhancing the expression of growth factors and cytokines. Further studies are required to evaluate the impact of TGFβ treatment on functional blood vessel formation in the heart. TGFβ1 signalling as a therapeutic target for heart failure? TGFβ1 coordinates a broad spectrum of cellular processes that contributes to cardiac remodelling after MI and subsequent progression to heart failure (Bujak and Frangogiannis  2007 ). It can be beneficial or deleterious depending on the stage of disease development. For example, TGFβ1 plays a pivotal role in wound repair after infarction by suppressing inflammation, promoting the myofibroblast transition, and inducing blood vessel remodelling (Dobaczewski et al.  2011 ). However, prolonged TGFβ activation leads to excessive ECM deposition remote from the infarct site causing further damage to normal tissue architecture and cardiac function (Bujak et al.  2007 ). Indeed, inhibition of TGFβ before or immediately following MI led to further deterioration on cardiac function and increase mortality (Ikeuchi et al.  2004 ; Frantz et al.  2008 ), whereas its inhibition at 24 h post-MI attenuated remodelling with improved cardiac function in animal models of ischemic heart failure (Ikeuchi et al.  2004 ; Okada et al.  2005 ; Ellmers et al.  2008 ). In addition, due to its multifunctional and context dependent actions, a complete blockage of TGFβ signalling may cause undesirable side effects on immune regulation (Sasaki et al.  1992 ), angiogenesis (Bertolino et al.  2005 ), cancer surveillance (Salomon  2014 ) and wound healing (Faler et al.  2006 ). Taken together, TGFβ-targeted treatment must be carefully designed. A strategy that selectively attenuates the fibrogenic effect but stimulates the pro-angiogenic aspect of TGFβ1 may serve as an ideal treatment option for heart failure. The interaction between LRG1 and TGFβ signalling Leucine-rich α-2 glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) is a member of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) family of proteins, many of which are involved in protein–protein interactions, signalling and cell adhesion (Ng et al.  2011 ). Studies have shown that differential expression of LRG1 is associated with different types of cancer (Kawakami et al.  2005 ; Kakisaka et al.  2007 ; Ferrero et al.  2009 ; Andersen et al.  2010 ; Guergova-Kuras et al.  2011 ; Li et al.  2011 ; Sandanayake et al.  2011 ; Ladd et al.  2012 ; Linden et al.  2012 ,  2013 ; Liu et al.  2012 ; Wu et al.  2013 ; He et al.  2014 ; Wen et al.  2014 ), neurodegenerative disease (Miyajima et al.  2013 ), inflammatory diseases (Kentsis et al.  2012 ; Kharbanda et al.  2012 ; Serada et al.  2012 ), hydrocephalus (Li et al.  2006 ,  2007 ; Nakajima et al.  2010 ,  2011 ), heart failure (Watson et al.  2011 ), autoimmune disease (Serada et al.  2010 ), and ageing (Nakajima et al.  2012 ) We found recently that LRG1 is expressed in quiescent vasculature at low levels but is significantly up-regulated together with TGFβ1 in remodelled and neovascular vessels in the eye (Wang et al.  2013 ). We showed that LRG1 interacts with multiple TGFβ receptors, especially ENG, which together with TGFβ1 further promotes the ability of LRG1 to bind angiogenic ALK1 but inhibits the association between LRG1 and angiostatic ALK5. The recruitment of LRG1 into the pro-angiogenic TGFβ receptor complex leads to enhanced Smad 1, 5 phosphorylation, EC proliferation, tube formation and blood vessel outgrowth. LRG1 inhibition by genetic knockout, siRNA knockdown or neutralizing antibodies led to reduced angiogenesis. In summary, our study showed that LRG1 plays a critical role in defining the context-dependent TGFβ signalling in ECs (Wang et al.  2013 ). There is evidence that LRG1 is involved in other TGFβ-regulated processes. TGFβ is known to stimulate the expression of endothelin (ET1) (Ahmedat et al.  2012 ), an important molecule involved in myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis. ET1 has been shown to inhibit LRG1 expression in dermal fibroblasts suggesting a potential role of LRG1 in TGFβ-mediated fibrosis (GEO accession GDS1980 / 1417290_at / Lrg1) (Vallender and Lahn  2006 ). The involvement of LRG1 in cardiac remodelling and heart failure LRG1 and ageing heart As an unavoidable process of life, different systems of the body undergo progressive structural and functional alterations, and the heart is not an exception. With ageing, there is increased plaque formation in coronary arteries, cardiac wall thickness and interstitial fibrosis (Mendes et al.  2012 ; Dayal et al.  2013 ). These structural changes of myocardium are accompanied with concurrent vascular abnormalities, such as reduced diameter and density of collateral vessels, decreased vasodilation, and increased stiffness of vessel walls (Heil and Schaper  2004 ; Faber et al.  2011 ; Wang et al.  2011 ). In addition, there is a decreased expression and availability of growth factors such as hypoxia-inducible factor 1α and VEGF in response to hypoxic stress (Rivard et al.  2000 ), and ECs become less responsive to the stimulation of angiogenic growth factors with ageing (Lahteenvuo and Rosenzweig  2012 ). These alterations contribute to compromised cardiac function, increased susceptibility to damage and reduced ability to repair, which subsequently lead to increased incidence of heart failure in ageing population. Two separate studies have reported an decreased expression of LRG1 in the heart of aged mice compared to that in young mice (GDS2996 / 1417290_at / Lrg1 and GDS2972 / 97420_at / Lrg1) (Reiter et al.  2007 ). However, it is not clear whether the reduced LRG1 expression is the cause or the consequence of ageing-related structural and functional changes in the heart. Further studies are required to explore the role of LRG1 in specific patho-physiologies of the ageing heart and to discover whether it is possible to prevent or reverse age-dependent deterioration of the heart by overexpressing LRG1. LRG1 and cardiac hypertrophy Cardiac hypertrophy is the thickening of the heart wall in response to increased pressure or volume stress. Under certain conditions, such as during pregnancy or after sustained exercise, the enlargement of heart muscle is beneficial and is normally associated with a proportional increase in chamber dimensions and neovascularization (Catalucci et al.  2008 ). There is no concurrent fibrosis or reactivation of a foetal gene program in this physiological adaptation process (Beisvag et al.  2009 ). In addition, physiological hypertrophy does not cause increased risk of arrhythmia, impairment in cardiac function or future heart failure. Instead, exercise training has been shown to protect the heart against ageing-induced up-regulation of collagen deposition, collagen cross-linking, TIMP synthesis and down-regulation of active MMPs (Thomas et al.  2000 ,  2001 ; Kwak et al.  2008 ). The ageing-associated increase in extra-myocyte space was also significantly attenuated in rats which underwent exercise training (Kwak et al.  2008 ,  2011 ). Pathological cardiac hypertrophy, on the other hand, occurs as a consequence of hypertension, aortic stenosis, or other disease-causing stimuli. It is associated with significant structural abnormalities, which can lead to contractile dysfunction, arrhythmias and eventually heart failure (Scheuer et al.  1982 ; Breisch et al.  1986 ). The activation of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway has been implicated in adaptive cardiac hypertrophy with endurance exercise (Neri Serneri et al.  2001 ). Studies have shown that transient activation of Akt1 leads to reversible cardiac hypertrophy, which is associated with reduced expression of Lrg1 (GDS2304 / 1417290_at / Lrg1) (Schiekofer et al.  2006 ). Consistent with this observation, a dominant negative form of PI3K significantly attenuates cardiac hypertrophy in the heart of transgenic mice overexpressing IGF1 receptor, which is also associated with a concurrent up-regulation of Lrg1 (GDS648 / 97420_at / Lrg1) (McMullen et al.  2004 ). However, a separate study showed no change in Lrg1 expression in transgenic mice with either constitutive active PI3K or dominant negative PI3K (GDS446 / 97420_at / Lrg1). Also, no change in Lrg1 expression was detected in the heart of rats following moderate physical training (GDS3134/1374626_at/Lrg1) (Giusti et al.  2009 ). These seemingly contradictory observations might be due to differences in the design of transgenic strategies, spatial and temporal expression pattern of transgenes, and the use of different animal species. Further studies are required to elucidate the role of LRG1 in physiological cardiac hypertrophy. A reduced expression of LRG1 is observed in mouse models of pathological cardiac hypertrophy. LRG1 expression is significantly attenuated in the heart of mice with compensated pressure overload hypertrophy induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) (GDS794 / 97420_at / Lrg1, GDS3465 / 1417290_at / Lrg1) (Zhao et al.  2004 ; Smeets et al.  2008 ). A missense E180G mutation in α-tropomyosin (TM), an important contractile protein involved in sarcomeric function, is associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Chang et al.  2005 ). Transgenic mice overexpressing α-TM E180G exhibit severe cardiac hypertrophy characterized by myocyte disarray, asymmetric ventricular enlargement, fibrosis, cardiac arrhythmia and eventually die of heart failure (Michele et al.  2002 ). The expression of Lrg1 is significantly down-regulated in the ventricle of α-TM E180G transgenic mice (GDS2134 / 1417290_at / Lrg1) (Rajan et al.  2006 ). Together, the literature supports lower LRG1 expression being associated with cardiac hypertrophy. Further studies are required to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism. Analysis of cardiac phenotypes in Lrg1 −/−  with exercise or pressure overload-induced hypertrophy will provide valuable information regarding the role of LRG1 in physiological and pathological cardiac hypertrophy. LRG1 overexpression might be able to reverse cardiac hypertrophy induced by the activation of IGF1/PI3K/Akt1 pathway, exercise, pressure overload, and in α-TM E180G transgenic mice. The activation of latent TGFβ requires functional and physical cooperation of mannose-6-phosphate (M6P)/IGF II receptor (IGFIIR) and the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) (Leksa et al.  2005 ). Furthermore, both TGFβ1 and IGF1 signal through the PI3K/Akt pathway and there is an extensive crosstalk between the two signalling pathways during cardiac fibrosis (Butt et al.  1995 ), cardiomyocyte apoptosis (Hynes et al.  2009 ), cardiac remodelling following myocardial infarction (Stavropoulou et al.  2010 ) and cardiac hypertrophy (Lisa et al.  2011 ). Understanding the role of LRG1 in TGFβ1 and IGF1 interactions may shed new light on the molecular mechanism of cardiac hypertrophy. LRG1 and dilated cardiomyopathy Muscle LIM protein (MLP) is a muscle-restricted cytoskeletal binding protein. The down-regulation of MLP protein is observed in human patients with idiopathic-dilated cardiomyopathy (Zolk et al.  2000 ). Consistent with this observation, MLP −/−  mice develop dilated cardiomyopathy and eventually heart failure (Arber et al.  1997 ). Calsequestrin (CSQ) is a high-capacity sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+  binding protein. The myocardial-targeted overexpression of CSQ also leads to heart failure associated with dilated cardiomyopathy and left ventricular dysfunction (Jones et al.  1998 ). Both mouse models exhibited many key features present in the failing heart in human, such as functional β-AR uncoupling (Rockman et al.  1998 ). Advanced heart failure is normally developed in 6-month old MLP −/−  mice and 14-week old CSQ transgenic mice. Despite different aetiologies, a decreased Lrg1 expression is associated with deterioration of cardiac function with lowest Lrg1 expression observed at the advanced stage of heart failure in both mouse models (GDS411 / aa172851_s_at / Lrg1) (Blaxall et al.  2003 ). However, the molecular basis of LRG1 down-regulation in both mouse models remains to be resolved, which is vital for dissecting the mechanism of dilated cardiomyopathy pathogenesis. LRG1 overexpression in myocardium might restore cardiac function and slow down the progression of heart failure in both models. Information extracted from this study will assist the designing effective treatment for dilated cardiomyopathy associated heart failure. LRG1 and hypertension Hypertension is a major risk factor for heart failure. To work against the high pressure, the heart must pump harder, which may lead to left ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure over time. The S.LWEx12x2x3x5 congenic rat is a model for hypertension and exhibits concentric cardiac hypertrophy. The expression of LRG1 is significantly down-regulated in the left ventricle of hypertensive S.LWEx12x2x3x5 rat exhibiting concentric cardiac hypertrophy with augmented contractile function (GDS3873 _ 1374626_at _ Lrg1) (Gopalakrishnan et al.  2011 ). However, it is not clear whether hypertension has a direct impact on the expression of Lrg1 or mediates LRG1 expression indirectly via hypertension-induced compensation. To study the expression of Lrg1 in other hypertension animal models with or without myocardial abnormalities will enrich our understanding of direct association between LRG1 and hypertension aetiology and development. LRG1 overexpression at the right dosage and right timing might prevent or reverse hypertension and hypertension-induced cardiomyopathy. Perspectives There is compelling evidence to suggest that TGFβ1 is associated with various cardiac pathologies involved in heart failure. Targeting TGFβ1 therefore represents an attractive strategy in managing progression of the disease. A number of therapeutic approaches for blocking the actions of TGFβ1 have been suggested, such as TGFβ1 neutralizing antibody (Kuwahara et al.  2002 ), soluble TGFβ receptor II (Okada et al.  2005 ), and small molecule inhibitors (Engebretsen et al.  2014 ). Some of these successfully attenuated cardiac fibrosis, decreased ventricular chamber dilation, improved cardiac function, and reduced mortality after infarction in preclinical studies (Kuwahara et al.  2002 ; Ellmers et al.  2008 ; Lian et al.  2010 ). However, given its role in angiogenesis, targeting TGFβ may affect collateral and microvessel formation, remodelling and perfusion following MI and cause increased burden of ischemic tissue. In addition, TGFβ1 is a pleiotropic cytokine with vital homeostatic functions. Broad TGFβ inhibition is likely to have adverse side effects, such as the development of autoimmune diseases, delayed wound healing, and tumour formation. Selectively targeting specific disease-driving aspects of TGFβ signalling at the right dose and timing and for an appropriate period is therefore critical in producing desirable therapeutic effects. Our recent study led to the identification of a novel angiogenic factor, LRG1. In addition to ECs, LRG1 is also expressed in cardiac fibroblasts (Ifkovits et al.  2014 ) and cardiomyocytes (Chen et al.  2004 ). It is likely that LRG1 mediates TGFβ signalling through the ubiquitously expressed type I TGFβ receptor, ALK5, in non-ECs. There is convincing evidence that a decreased expression of LRG1 is associated with increased fibrosis, aberrant vascular properties, and altered cardiomyocytes characteristics in ageing heart, and in failing heart induced by genetic modification, pressure overload, or hypertension (Fig.  2 ). Understanding the molecular mechanism underlying the role of LRG1 and its regulation in cardiac remodelling process will assist the development of novel treatments for heart failure. Fig. 2 Potential role of LRG1 in cardiac remodelling. In the failing heart, the ability of blood vessels to respond to angiogenic factors is compromised, fibroblasts acquire myofibroblast phenotype by expressing increased ECM protein, and cardiomycytes are enlarged and undergo increased apoptosis. TGFβ1 mainly signals through ALK5 in ECs, cardiomyocyte and myofibroblasts leading to cardiac remodelling. In LRG1-treated heart, LRG1 switches TGFβ1 signalling towards the proangiogenic ALK1 signalling in ECs and promotes blood vessel formation. In myofibroblasts, LRG1 competes with TGFβ to bind ALK5 and antagonise TGFβ-induced ECM synthesis and to prevent fibrosis. With the presence of LRG1, there is reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and size 
 LRG1, a potential target for therapeutic angiogenesis LRG1 promotes EC proliferation, tube formation and vessel outgrowth through regulating the endothelial TGFβ signalling (Wang et al.  2013 ). As it binds to the ubiquitously expressed type I TGFβ receptor, ALK5, LRG1 might mediate the signalling and function of other types of vascular cells and regulate blood vessel remodelling. TGFβ1 interacts with VEGF signalling at the receptor level (Glinka et al.  2011 ) and regulates VEGF expression in macrophages (Jeon et al.  2007 ) and ECs (Ferrari et al.  2006 ). Understanding the role of LRG1 in TGFβ1 and VEGF crosstalk may provide valuable information regarding the molecular mechanism of angiogenesis, and facilitate the development of novel therapeutic angiogenesis strategies. Angiogenic factors are normally released in a tightly controlled and timely manner. Lessons learned from previous studies suggested that the hypoxia condition of the ischemic tissue during treatment dramatically affects the benefit of therapeutic angiogenesis. Virus-based transgene delivery systems offer an opportunity for site-specific administration at the right location, time and dose. The route of delivery may also affect the efficacy of treatment. Direct delivery to the myocardium may be an effective method for therapeutic angiogenesis in the heart. Comorbidities are known to have a great impact on the outcome of therapeutic angiogenesis. It is therefore important to evaluate the impact of LRG1 on angiogenesis under heart failure-associated disease conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity. As oedema can impose further burdens on ischemic tissue, studies are required to investigate the impact of LRG1 on blood permeability. It is worth noting that excessive angiogenesis contributes to cancer growth and metastasis, atherosclerotic plaque expansion and instability, arthritis and blinding eye diseases. Understanding the involvement of LRG1 in other vascular complications will help to predict potential side effects of the treatment. Taken together, LRG1 is an attractive target for therapeutic angiogenesis. Further studies are required to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of LRG1 treatment for heart failure. LRG1, a potential modulator of cardiac remodelling process Cardiac fibrosis is a key contributor to the morbidity and mortality in heart failure. Despite intense research efforts, no effective treatment is available to control this detrimental process. Evidence showed that a reduced expression of LRG1 is associated with an increased TGFβ1 activity during the cardiac remodelling process in response to injury. However, it is not clear whether TGFβ1 exerts its function by inhibiting the expression of LRG1. As LRG1 binds ALK5 and TGFβRII independently of TGFβ1, it may exert its function by competing with TGFβ1 for binding with the ALK5/TGFβRII receptor complex. In addition to its role in mediating TGFβ1 signalling in endothelial cells, ENG plays an important role in cardiac fibrosis (Kapur et al.  2012 ). Unveiling the interaction between ENG and LRG1 in fibrosis will advance our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying the cardiac remodelling process. It is widely accepted that context-dependent TGFβ1 signalling is defined by extensive interaction with other signalling pathways including IGF1 and AngII. Understanding the involvement of LRG1 in this highly complex network will shed light on the molecular mechanism of cardiac remodelling. Studies have shown that non-ECs including cardiac fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes also express LRG1. It will be interesting to see novel binding partners of LRG1 in these cells, and it will help to elucidate the TGFβ1-independent role of LRG1 in non-ECs in the heart. On the other hand, ECM is important for maintaining atherosclerotic plaque stability. Augment of collagen degradation has been correlated with ruptured plaques in patients (Cheng et al.  2009 ). Further studies are required to unveil the molecular and cellular mechanism of LRG1 in atherosclerotic plaque development and progression, which will provide valuable insights into the potential side effects of LRG1-targeted treatment. Summary At the moment, the focus of heart failure treatment is directed at risk factor management and alleviating symptoms; however, not all patients are suitable or will benefit from current therapeutics. As the magnitude of heart failure continues to accelerate globally, there is a pressing need for new treatments. Direct intervention on structural abnormalities of myocardium is a promising strategy. A reduced expression of LRG1 is associated with cardiac remodelling characterised by hypertrophy, fibrosis, and abnormal vasculature in various conditions leading to heart failure. However, it is not clear whether altered LRG1 expression is the cause or the consequence of these detrimental processes, or how LRG1 is correlated with specific pathologies and evolution of the disease. Although a great deal of work is still needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms, targeting LRG1 and its regulators might offer a unique approach to treating heart failure by simultaneously targeting different pathologies of the disease. </Body>

    <Doi>10.1007/s12551-013-0102-6</Doi>
    <Authors>García de la Torre José, Harding Stephen E.</Authors>
    <Abstact>The last three decades has seen some important advances in our ability to represent the conformation of proteins in solution on the basis of hydrodynamic measurements. Advances in theoretical modeling capabilities have been matched by commensurate advances in the precision of hydrodynamic measurements. We consider the advances in whole-body (simple ellipsoid-based) modeling—still useful for providing an overall idea of molecular shape, particularly for those systems where only a limited amount of data is available—and outline the ELLIPS suite of algorithms which facilitates the use of this approach. We then focus on bead modeling strategies, particularly the surface or shell–bead approaches and the HYDRO suite of algorithms. We demonstrate how these are providing great insights into complex issues such as the conformation of immunoglobulins and other multi-domain complexes.</Abstact>
    <Body>Introduction There are two approaches to the hydrodynamic modelling of proteins. The simplest is “whole-body modelling” using ellipsoids which involves the exact hydrodynamic equations linking hydrodynamic measurements with the axial ratios describing the ellipsoidal shape. This approach which has been used since Perrin ( 1934 ,  1936 ) and Simha ( 1940 ) provided relationships linking the axial ratio for both prolate and oblate ellipsoids of revolution (ellipsoids with two equal axes) with the frictional properties (rotational and translational) and intrinsic viscosity, respectively. Progress was made in the 1940s–1950s in dealing with the “hydration problem”, namely the recognition that the frictional ratio and intrinsic viscosity had contributions not only from asymmetry but also the volume of the protein, “swollen” by the time-averaged interaction with the surrounding solvent. Graphical (Mehl et al.  1940 ; Oncley  1940 ), and analytical solutions for evaluating the axial ratio and hydration were provided (Scheraga and Mandelkern  1953 ). Intriguingly, Saito ( 1951 ) had questioned Simha’s derivation on the basis of an apparently erroneous assumption (macromolecules rotating with zero angular velocity in viscous flow rather than rotating at the same angular velocity as the surrounding liquid), whilst arriving at the same relationship himself. Simha’s derivation was later shown to have reached the correct formula on the basis of an apparent cancellation of errors (Harding et al.  1982 ). Further progress was made with the removal of the restriction of two equal axes and the introduction of the general triaxial ellipsoid in the 1980s by combination of three different types of hydrodynamic measurement (see, e.g., Harding  1987 ). Calculation of the relevant parameters required solution of elliptic integrals: for ellipsoids of revolution, these integrals could be solved analytically using quadrature—although relationships were relatively complex, tabular or graphical values as a function of axial ratio became available along with simpler-to-use approximate formulae. For general ellipsoids, numerical solution of the integrals was needed using high-speed computers. Attention then moved to the production of easy-to-use algorithms, an endeavour which led to the ELLIPS algorithms now downloadable on  www.nottingham.ac.uk/ncmh . Whole-body modelling may be insufficient when finer structural details are being investigated, and it has proved inappropriate for representing the conformation of many classes of protein, particularly non-globular protein shapes, and multi-subunit structures, as is the case of antibodies and a variety of macromolecular complexes. It was, indeed, the lack of adequacy of ellipsoidal models for such cases that prompted the pioneering work of Bloomfield and coworkers in the 1960s (Bloomfield et al.  1967 ), who proposed application of the bead model concept, initially developed in polymer physics for simple, chain-like or rod-like structures, to model the peculiar shapes of biomacromolecules. The concept evolved over the years (see, e.g., Garcia de la Torre and Bloomfied  1981 ; Carrasco and Garcia de la Torre  1999 ) by implementing new theoretical advances into computational algorithms that made use of the continuously increasing computing power. After the publication of the first public-domain bead-modeling program HYDRO (García de la Torre et al.  1994 ), a suite of software has been developed and made available to the scientific community ( http://leonardo.inf.um.es/macromol/ ). This methodology can now be applied to a variety of complex situations quite simply and with considerably reduced computing requirements. In this short review, we consider aspects of the ELLIPS and HYDRO suites of algorithms for whole-body and bead model representations of conformation in solution. For fuller details, the researcher is referred to the respective websites. Whole body models—the ELLIPS suite of algorithms With whole-body modelling we make no assumptions concerning starting estimates for the structure—other than assuming the molecule is rigid—and calculate the shape directly from the measurement of one or more hydrodynamic parameters. The shape model is a smooth whole regular structure—namely an ellipsoid characterised by three perpendicular semi-axes  a, b, c,  with  a ≥ b ≥ c,  and two independent axial ratios (conventionally  a/b, b/c ). The common limiting forms are the prolate (with semi-axes  a,b,b ) and oblate ( a, a, b ) “ellipsoids of revolution” described by a single axial ratio  a/b , with  a &gt; b  in both cases. The ELLIPS algorithms were developed for performing this type of modelling, initially for use on mainframe computers (Harding  1983 ), then for MS-DOS (Harding et al.  1997 ), and finally for the Windows platform (Harding et al.  2005 ). It has been periodically updated for alterations in Window platforms on  www.nottingham.ac.uk/ncmh , the latest being for Windows XP or Windows 7. Table  1  gives a summary of what these do. Obviously, many classes of molecule cannot be reasonably represented by a smooth symmetrical shape—antibodies are a good example—this type of whole-body modelling is not applicable and bead-approaches need to be employed. Even here, however, ellipsoidal representations of the major domains (Fab, Fc) have helped in the bead modelling of the intact assembly (Carrasco et al.  1999 ,  2001 ; Longman et al.  2003 ; Lu et al.  2006 ,  2007 ). Table 1 The ELLIPS suite of whole-body modeling algorithms Routine Language Model Purpose ELLIPS1 QUICKBASIC Ellipsoid of Revolution Prediction of axial ratio ( a/b ) from any user specified shape function ELLIPS2 FORTRAN General Triaxial Ellipsoid Evaluates all the hydrodynamic shape functions from user specified ( a , b , c ) or ( a/b, b/c ) ELLIPS3 FORTRAN General Triaxial Ellipsoid Evaluates ( a/b, b/c ) from combinations of hydration independent shape functions ELLIPS4 FORTRAN General Triaxial Ellipsoid Evaluates ( a/b, b/c ) from electro-optic decay combined with other data 
 Universal shape functions—ELLIPSPRIME The ELLIPS algorithms work with “universal shape” parameters—i.e. parameters which can be described by a unique function of shape and not of size. The simplest of these is the Einstein-Simha shape function ν, which is measurable from the intrinsic viscosity of a protein and has a value ≥2.5 (the limiting value being for a sphere). Another is the Perrin function P, which is measurable from the sedimentation coefficient or translational diffusion coefficient of a protein and has a value ≥1. All these universal shape functions have been worked out in terms of the axial ratio ( a/b ) for ellipsoids of revolution and also the two axial ratios ( a/b, b/c ) for general ellipsoids. The relations of all these to ( a/b ) or ( a/b, b/c ) are given in Harding ( 1995 ). To measure these shape functions experimentally, many—including ν and P—require knowledge of the hydration δ (mass in g of H 2 O associated per g of dry macromolecule) or hydrated volume  V  (ml) of the particle, though the others do not. Hydration is a dynamic process, and so δ and  V  represent time-averaged values. It is wrong, however, to assume that because of the dynamic nature of hydration it has no affect on hydrodynamic properties. The residence time for water/solvent in the so-called hydration layer(s) has been shown to be different from that in bulk water (Denisov and Halle  1996 ). The particle volume  V  is often presented in two equivalent forms: 1 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

There are also a plethora of shape functions relating to rotational frictional behaviour (fluorescence anisotropy decay and electric birefringence decay) described in Harding ( 1983 ) and Harding et al., ( 1997 ,  2005 ). In addition there are also universal shape functions that do not require knowledge of δ or  V  for their experimental measurement. These are obtained by combining two hydrodynamic parameters. The classical example is the Scheraga-Mandelkern β parameter (from combination of ν with P)—although this is a very insensitive function of shape. Another and much more useful example is the Pi function (Harding  1981 ) from the combination of intrinsic viscosity measurement with measurement of the 2nd thermodynamic virial coefficient: 6 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

 Other examples involve combination of either ν or P with rotational frictional-based functions such as the harmonic mean rotational relaxation time. To assist with the calculation of the Universal parameters such as ν, P and  u 
 red , and Π from the relevant experimental parameters, an Excel spreadsheet routine ELLIPSPRIME has been set up specifically for this purpose. Ellipsoids of revolution: ELLIPS1 ELLIPS1 is based on simple ellipsoid of revolution models (where two of the three axes of the ellipsoid are fixed equal to each other); if the user enters a value for a shape function from sedimentation or other types of hydrodynamic measurement, it will return a value for the axial ratio of the ellipsoid. The question an experimenter wishes to address usually is not “what is the shape function for a specified value of the axial ratio  a/b ?” but rather “what is the axial ratio  a/b  for my macromolecule specified by my (universal) shape function which I have experimentally measured?”. Although there are exact analytical formulae linking each shape function with  a/b , the reverse is not true: inversion is analytically impossible. The QUICKBASIC algorithm ELLIPS1 uses the polynomial-based inversion procedure of Harding et al. ( 1997 ) to give  a/b  versus the various universal shape functions to an acceptable degree of accuracy (i.e. to better than the precision of the measurement, which is normally no better than a few percent). Figure  1  gives some recent published examples. Fig. 1 ELLIPS1 representations for  a  the tetanus toxoid protein, used in glycoconjugate vaccines (adapted from Abdelhameed et al.  2012 ) and  b  wheat protein gliadins α, β, ω f  and ω s  (Ang et al.  2010 ) 
 Evaluation of hydrodynamic properties from the axial dimensions of a protein: ELLIPS2 ELLIPS2 evaluates exactly a complete set of universal shape functions for user-specified values of the axial ratios of a protein. All the user has to do is enter the two axial ratios ( a/b, b/c ) for the protein from the axial dimensions of the molecule (e.g. from x-ray crystallography). Since prolate and oblate ellipsoids of revolution are two limiting forms of the general ellipsoid, the program will also of course evaluate the set of parameters for these two situation, as well as for (rigid) tapes ( a&gt;&gt;b&gt;&gt;c ). An example of the method has been evaluation of the hydrodynamic parameters for tri-axial ellipsoid models for IgG Fab and Fc domains, using the crystallographic dimensions for these structures (Fig.  2 ). For example, P values were evaluated for this and compared with the corresponding bead–shell model representations of the surfaces, validating the latter for subsequent use in construction of models for the intact antibody structure. Fig. 2 
 a  ELLIPS2 output for IgG antibody domain B72.3c Fab’ (see Carrasco et al.  2001 ).  b  The axial ratios of ( a/b, b/c ) =1.60, 1.42) used for this example were obtained from the crystal structure of Brady et al. ( 1992 ) using the algorithm of Taylor et al. ( 1983 ), which fits a surface ellipsoid to crystallographic atomic co-ordinate data from the protein data bank (PDB) 
 Evaluation tri-axial dimensions from hydrodynamic parameters ELLIPS3 and ELLIPS4 ELLIPS3 and 4 perform the reverse of ELLIPS2 by evaluating the tri-axial shape of a macromolecule ( a/b, b/c ) from hydrodynamic measurements. At least three experimental parameters are required since there are 3 unknowns— a/b, b/c  and the hydration δ. For example, ELLIPS3 has been set up to allow the evaluation of ( a/b, b/c ) from a combination of measurements of the intrinsic viscosity, the second thermodynamic virial coefficient and the radius of gyration, or from a combination of the intrinsic viscosity with the harmonic mean rotational relaxation time (from steady state fluorescence depolarisation experiments) and sedimentation data. For example, it has been successfully applied to the study of myosin rods and the study of the mode of dimerisation of the neural protein neurophysin. ELLIPS3 uses as its basis the function calculation routine of ELLIPS2 except that a whole array of such values are evaluated in the ( a/b, b/c ) plane (a matrix of 40 × 40 values). A contour plotting routine (RGCNTS from the Simpleplot Library) interpolates between these matrix points, thereby effecting a combination of line solutions to yield a unique solution with allowance for experimental error, of ( a/b, b/c ) for a protein. ELLIPS4 is similar but involves a combination of intrinsic viscosity and sedimentation data with electric birefringence decay data, using a constrained fit procedure for extraction of the decay constants. Bead models—the HYDRO suite of algorithms and the concept of equivalent radii As mentioned in the Introduction, after the first release of the HYDRO computer program for hydrodynamics of bead models (Garcia de la Torre et al.  1994 ), the collection of computer programs has been considerably expanded. Hereafter, we shall give some details for only those tools that are most relevant for the study of protein hydrodynamics, particularly the programs HYDROPRO, HYDRONMR and HYDROSUB. It is convenient to mention here another advance, which consists of an interface between the results of those programs and experimental data, in order to search for conformations that would fit a set of data for several proteins. For such a purpose, we have found it convenient to employ the solution properties in the form of equivalent radii (Ortega and Garcia de la Torre  2007 ). For a given value of some property, the equivalent radius of the particle is the radius that a spherical particle would have in order to reproduce that value. For instance, the equivalent radius for translational hydrodynamics, sometimes called Stokes radius, is defined as  a

The HYDRO suite contains an ancillary program, HYDROFIT (Ortega et al.  2011b ), intended to carry out such a kind of structural optimisation from the results produced by HYDRO, HYDROPRO, HYDROSUB, etc. (Table  2 ).

 Calculation of solution properties of rigid proteins from their detailed molecular structure Simple, single-valued quantities like the hydrodynamic coefficients and the radius of gyration are low-resolution properties, and one cannot hope to extract from them highly detailed structural information. On the other hand, high-resolution techniques like diffraction and NMR provide detailed, even atomic-level, structures, although at the cost of complex instrumentation and data handling. Historically, these techniques came after many decades during which the structural elucidation of proteins was mainly based on hydrodynamic properties, analysed in terms of primitive ellipsoidal models. However, it was realized that, because of the complexity of their determination, such structures should be validated against experimental data of readily accessible properties of the protein in solution. This purpose motivated the development of a methodology for predicting solution properties from high-resolution structures with even atomic-level detail. A pioneering attempt, when x-ray diffraction structures were still scarce, was that by Teller et al. ( 1976 ). The availability of developments in hydrodynamic computations, implemented in the computer program HYDRO (Garcia de la Torre et al.  1994 ), prompted further advances in the application to proteins; among many others, the work of Byron ( 1997 ) for atomic-level models is particularly remarkable. Some aspects in hydrodynamic modelling that were deficient by then were improved later on (Carrasco and Garcia de la Torre  1999 ), providing the framework for a methodology specific for rigid proteins, implemented in the program HYDROPRO (Garcia de la Torre et al.  2000 ), which allowed the calculation of solution properties from a set of atomic coordinates in PDB format. Since then, some alternative procedures have been proposed (Rai et al.  2005 ; Aragon and Hahn  2006 ; Brookes et al.  2010 ), but HYDROPRO has been, by far, the most frequently used tool for this purpose. Very recently (Ortega et al.  2011a ,  b ), this program has been fully refurbished, with inclusion of new modelling strategies and improvements in computational aspects. Hereafter, we summarise the main features of the present methodology In the original HYDROPRO procedure (Garcia de la Torre et al.  2000 ), an atomic-level structure, as specified in a set of  N 
 at  atomic coordinates, was the origin of a primary hydrodynamic model (PHM) in which each non-hydrogen atom is replaced by a spherical element, beads of radius  a 
 at  which should be even larger than van der Waals radii in order to account for hydration, so that beads in the PHM overlap appreciably. In order to avoid some hydrodynamic problems regarding bead overlapping, the PHM was in turn replaced by a shell model, in which a number of hydrodynamic centres,  N , of non-overlapping “minibeads” of radius σ cover the surface of the PHM. Properties are calculated for several, increasing values of N, up to about 2,000, with decreasing sigma, and the results extrapolated to  N  → ∞. The hydrodynamic calculations require handling a 3 N  × 3  N  matrix (which for the finest shell model would be 6,000 × 60,00), with computing time proportional to  N 
 3 . The present, state-of-the-art HYDROPRO methodology includes important improvements, particularly in efficiency achieved by techniques of high-performance computing, and new modelling features. One of them is the possibility of predicting the solution properties from a lower resolution, non-atomic, residue-level model of the protein, specified by a list of coordinates of C α  atoms. Another refers to the hydrodynamic treatment of bead overlapping, that has allowed the possibility of making the hydrodynamic calculation directly from the primary hydrodynamic model (PHM)—which in the case of the residue-level model would contain a number of elements equal to the number of amino acid residues,  N 
 res . Computing time would be then proportional to  N 
 res 
 3 , with an evident computational advantage over the shell calculations for proteins of less than, say, 1,000 residues. Thus, there are now various computational strategies possibilities: “Atomic/PHM → Shell”. An atomic PHM with overlapping beads of  a  = 2.9 Å, built from atomic coordinates, is in the computation replaced by a shell model of up to  N  ≅ 20,00 minibeads “Residue/PHM → Shell”. A residue-level PHM with overlapping beads of  a  = 5.0 Å, built from Cα coordinates, is in the computation replaced by a shell model of up to  N  ≅ 20,00 minibeads “Residue/PHM”. A residue-level PHM with overlapping beads of  a  = 6.1 Å, built from Cα coordinates, is directly used in the computation, which involves  N 
 res  beads 
 Note that all the methods require a PHM, so that the primary parameter is the radius,  a , of the (overlapping) beads in the PHM. As in the primitive version of HYDROPRO (Garcia de la Torre et al.  2000 ), this parameter has been adjusted so as to reproduce experimental data for small- and medium-sized proteins, with the improvement in the new version of making the parameterisation with an extensive set of various properties (translational coefficients, intrinsic viscosity, rotational relaxation) for over 70 proteins and of over 150 experimental data. For the global fit of such large and complex set, we employed the procedure described above based on the optimisation of equivalent radii. The results are displayed in Table  3 . Table 3 Best-fitting values of the bead size,  a , in the PHM of proteins for the several computing strategies, and typical (mean) percent deviation, % dif., found for translational properties, radius of gyration, intrinsic viscosity and relaxation time.

 It seems clear from the summary in Table  3  and the examples in Fig.  3  that our procedures provide highly accurate predictions for the radius of gyration, Stokes radius and other hydrodynamic radii; the deviation is in most cases within the range 3–6 %, and, considering that this includes the uncertainty of the experimental data themselves, then the errors introduced by the modelling and computational procedures are, indeed, quite small. Fig. 3 Numerical results for the predicted solution properties of some rigid proteins, as obtained from the three procedures, with indication of the deviation of the calculated results from the experimental ones 
 It is also noteworthy that models derived from residue-level structures provide predictions of the same quality as those from atomic models. This possibility seems of practical importance, as it extends the utility of HYDROPRO to cases where only lower-resolution structures are available. Another important feature is that the hydrodynamic calculation made directly from the residue-level PHM in the Residue/PHM method, with  N 
 res  hydrodynamic elements, performs nearly as well as the Residue/PHM → Shell and Residue/PHM → Shell procedures, both with a number of elements  N  up to 2,000. The computing time for the shell methods is not long (less than 3 min on typical, inexpensive personal computers); nonetheless, in cases where CPU consumption may be important—as in high-throughput structural search software in which HYDROPRO may be implemented (Bernado and Blackledge  2009 ; Cho et al.  2009 ; Krzeminski et al.  2013 )—with an unappreciable sacrifice in accuracy, our new non-shell alternative may be much more efficient for small- and medium-sized proteins (with less than, say, 1,000 residues) than the shell methodologies employed in our previous HYDROPRO (Garcia de la Torre et al.  2000 ) and other analogous procedures (Aragon and Hahn  2006 ). On the other hand, for large proteins and macromolecular complexes, the shell model procedures, with a fixed N and computing time independent on their size, is computationally advantageous. Methods in which the number of elements in the hydrodynamic model is related to the protein size, like our Residue/PHM or others (Brookes et al.  2010 ), may result in becoming too expensive or may even be not feasible for such cases. However, with the Atomic/PHM → Shell or Residue/PHM → Shell procedures, one can make hydrodynamic calculations with the same computing time, and a similarly good accuracy, for GroEL, or the 70S ribosomal particle, as for a protein as small as BPTI. Figure  4  presents a summary illustrating the performance of the three approaches for proteins across a wide range of molecular weight. Fig. 4 Plot of calculated versus experimental values of the equivalent radii, for the Residue/PHM method, showing the predictive capability of this scheme. Over 150 data from the various solution properties are displayed in the plot 
 NMR relaxation: HYDRONMR Single-valued properties, like the sedimentation and diffusion coefficient, the intrinsic viscosity or the radius of gyration reflect, in a single numerical value, the overall conformation of the protein, i.e. its size and shape in the case of rigid molecules. In its simplest mode of interpretation, dynamic NMR spectroscopy provides an overall correlation time, τ c , which corresponds to the harmonic mean relaxation time of the rigid body, τ h . However, the amount of information that can be extracted from this technique is much more abundant. For each amino acid residue in the protein, several quantities can be extracted, and within a dynamics perspective, the most important ones are the longitudinal and transverse relaxation times,  T 
 1  and  T 
 2 . These quantities are hydrodynamic properties, which depend primarily on the rotational diffusion tensor of the protein as a whole, but their distinct values for each residue depend also on the orientation of their N–H or C α –H bonds. Thus, the series of NMR relaxation times contains information not only on the overall size and shape of the rigid protein but also on the placement of each residue within its internal structure. After the proven ability of the HYDROPRO scheme for predicting the overall hydrodynamics of protein structures had been established—particularly the rigid-body rotational diffusion tensor—HYDRONMR was then developed. Essentially, the development consisted of the detection of the orientation of the involved bond vectors for each residue, and the calculation of  T 
 1 ,  T 
 2  and other properties using existing theory to predict them from rotational diffusivity and bond orientation—see, for instance, Palmer et al. ( 1996 ) and Tjandra et al. ( 1997 ). An example of the experimental results and HYDRONMR predictions is presented in Fig.  5 . Fig. 5 NMR Relaxation times of outer surface protein A, a highly anisotropic protein with 272 residues. The HYDROPRO calculation in the Atomic/PHM → Shell mode predicts a τ c  of 13.3 ns with the standard choice  a =  2.9 Å, in very good agreement with the experimental value of 13.7 ns. But this single value is not the only one that is nearly matched by the prediction; the HYDRONMR results for the series of  T 
 1 / T 
 2  ratios for the successive residues reproduce extremely well the experimental data (values shown for the region 100–150) 
 Solution properties from lower-resolution structure Other structural techniques, like cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) and small-angle, x-ray or neutron scattering (SAS), yield structures with a resolution lower than the atomic- or residue-level structures provided by other methods. Nonetheless, those lower-resolution structures are still sufficient for reliable prediction of solution properties, and tools for making such predictions are available. The outcome of cryoEM is a 3D density map from which the particle’s reconstruction is obtained from the points with density above a given threshold. HYDROMIC (Garcia de la Torre et al.  2001 ) reads the density map and builds hydrodynamic shell model from which the solution properties can be derived. Figure  6  displays the cryoEM-derived contour and its corresponding shell model. For some recent illustrative examples of HYDROMIC applications, see, for instance, Niewiarowski et al. ( 2010 ), Braun et al. ( 2011 ) or Del Castillo et al. ( 2011 ). Fig. 6

 20,w  = 24.1 S, in close agreement with the experimental value 25.6 S. For details, see Garcia de la Torre et al. ( 2001 ) 
 Other low-resolution techniques are small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering (acronyms SANS and SAXS, respectively). These techniques, particularly SAXS, are particularly used to obtain estimates of the size and shape of the particle from the angular dependence of the scattering intensity. The widely employed analysis programs, developed by Svergun and coworkers, including from DAMMIN (Svergun  1999 ) to DAMMIF (Franke and Svergun  2009 ) yield a 3D reconstruction in the form of an array of “pseudo-atoms” that represent the size and shape of the macromolecule. Then, a number of authors have employed the first version of HYDROPRO (Garcia de la Torre et al.  2000 ) to predict the hydrodynamic properties. As examples of successful applications, see Scott et al. ( 2002 ), Baldock et al. ( 2011 ), and Patel et al. ( 2012 ). In these applications of the Atomic/PHM → Shell mode HYDROPRO to models which do not contain true atoms, the authors made reasonable, ad hoc estimations of the value of the pseudo-atom radius,  a , to be employed in the calculations. At the time of writing this, we are devising an automated procedure, HYDROSAS, which, as in the case of HYDROMIC for cryoEM, would take the pseudo-atom model directly derived from the small-angle scattering (SAS) data by the reconstruction program, optimise internally the value of  a , and yield the final values of the hydrodynamic properties. Solution properties from subunit-level structure There may be instances in which the available level of structural detail is even lower than in the above-described applications, so that the hydrodynamic model must be accordingly simple. It may also happen that, although high-level structural information would be available, one would wish to concentrate on a few essential aspects of the structure, so that the level of description of other details is unimportant. In such cases, the macromolecule can be regarded as composed of a few subunits, which can indeed correspond to well-defined domains or entities, but may also be simply model building blocks. This is the basis for the methodology implemented in the computer program HYDROSUB (Garcia de la Torre and Carrasco  2002 ), in which the primary model is an array of subunits having the shape of cylinders (rods or disks) or ellipsoids of revolution. The structure is specified by a list, containing one register for each subunit, giving the sizes (axis lengths, or length and diameter), position of its centre, and orientation of the main axis. Internally, HYDROSUB constructs a shell model for which the properties are calculated. The paradigmatic application of this procedure is the determination of the basic structural features of antibody molecules. For instance, antibody IgG consists of three nearly globular subunits—two Fabs and one Fc—joined by a connector. The size and shape of the subunits is nearly the same, regardless of the specific origin or class of the IgG molecule. The subunits may be isolated and independently characterised by measuring solution properties; more recently, it has been possible to determine their detailed structure from x-ray diffraction, so that, alternatively, the solution properties can be predicted by HYDROPRO. Then, from the solution properties, the dimensions of the equivalent ellipsoids can be determined as described, the surfaces represented by bead–shell models which are then assembled via a linking hinge region to give a structure representing the average domain orientation of an intact immunologically active antibody (Carrasco et al.  1999 ,  2001 ; Lu et al.  2006 ,  2007 ). Thus, even if one could construct full atomic models from the atomic structures of the subunits, the HYDROSUB model always allows the calculation of the solution properties of such multisubunit structures. In the case of IgG antibodies, essential features are the hinge length and the disposition of the arms. Models constructed with ellipsoids for the subunits and a rod for the hinge allows one to concentrate on the dependence of solution properties on these aspects. Figure  7  illustrates the structural elucidation that differentiated the wild-type and a mutant form of the IgG3 antibody (Amoros et al.  2010 ). Having determined for each form a large set of experimental properties, namely the sedimentation coefficient and intrinsic viscosity, as well as the radius of gyration and longest distance from SAXS, the HYDROSUB calculations for multiple structures were analysed by means of HYDROFIT. For the wild-type, a unique, best-fitting structure is found, whose salient feature is a long hinge, with the calculated values of all the properties in excellent agreement with the experimental ones. For the mutant, several similarly well-fitting structures are found, all having in common an extremely short hinge, although several arrangements of the arms were compatible with the solution properties. This illustrates how the combined HYDROSUB/HYDROFIT treatment may determine the main structural features of multisubunit structures from solution properties, providing numerical values of the essential parameters, and informing on quality and uniqueness of the structural determination.

 The HYDROSUB approach has been successfully employed in other, quite different, applications; see, for instance, Zorrila et al. ( 2007 ), Gapinski et al. ( 2010 ) or Sokolova et al. ( 2010 ).

    <Authors>Changeux Jean-Pierre</Authors>
    <Abstact>The recent application of molecular dynamics (MD) methodology to investigate the allosteric transitions of the acetylcholine receptor and its prokaryotic and eukaryotic pentameric homologs has yielded new insights into the mechanisms of signal transduction by these receptors. Combined with available data on X-ray structures, MD techniques enable description of the dynamics of the conformational change at the atomic level, intra-molecular propagation of this signal transduction mechanism as a concerted stepwise process at physiological timescales and the control of this process by allosteric modulators, thereby offering new perspectives for drug design.</Abstact>
    <Body>Definition of allosteric interactions: importance of molecular dynamics We have recently celebrated the “50th anniversary of allostery”, and the concept is alive and well. Allosteric interactions between proteins and their regulatory ligands were initially defined as indirect interactions between topographically distinct sites that are mediated by a discrete reversible alteration of the molecular structure of the protein—and this definition is still valid (for review, Changeux  2013a ). The concept was first proposed in 1961 to account for the feedback inhibitory mechanism mediated by the first enzyme of bacterial biosynthetic pathways, in which the feedback inhibitor is not a steric analog of the substrate (Changeux  1961 ; Monod and Jacob  1961 ; Gerhart and Pardee  1962 ). It was expanded in 1963 (Monod et al.  1963 ) to explain the properties of regulatory proteins in general, including Perutz’s structural data on hemoglobin, in the framework of Koshland’s ( 1959 ) “induced fit” mechanism, according to which the ligand “instructs” rather than “selects” the protein conformational change. In 1965, attention focused on the observation that, in many regulatory proteins, in addition to, and possibly as part of, the signal transduction mechanism, substrates and regulatory ligands interact in a cooperative manner. It was also noted that all of these interactions may be simultaneously uncoupled by a variety of chemical or physical treatments (Changeux  1961 ; Gerhart and Pardee  1962 ). These observations point to a global mechanism at the protein level that makes these regulatory enzymes function as “molecular switches” (Monod et al.  1965 ; for review, Changeux  2012a ,  2013a , b ). To explain the particular protein design involved, a structural hypothesis was proposed where the cooperativity observed between the multiple binding sites for the substrate and regulatory ligand relies on the cooperative organization of the protein into “oligomers” comprising a small number of repeated units and possessing at least one axis of symmetry (Monod et al.  1965 ). A second critical assumption was that, unlike in the induced-fit model, the regulatory oligomers naturally exist  in the absence of the ligand  in at least two discrete conformations, the R state (for relaxed) and the T state (for constrained), which are in thermodynamic equilibrium. These states differ, in particular, in their tertiary distribution and/or inter-subunit bond energy (quaternary constraint). Ligands would then shift the conformational equilibrium by stabilizing the oligomer conformation for which they have the highest affinity, thus mediating signal transduction. Substrate and activators would stabilize the R state, inhibitors the T state. The model, termed the Monod–Wyman–Changeux (MWC) model (Monod et al.  1965 ), assumed that the conformational transition occurs simultaneously for all subunits: it is “concerted” and conserves the oligomer symmetry. Shortly thereafter, in  1966 , Koshland et al. proposed a sequential induced-fit mechanism of allosteric transition, referred to as the Koshland–Nemethy–Filmer (KNF) model, which involved a progressive conformational change with ligand binding that excludes any conformational change of the protein in the absence of the ligand. Abundant studies carried out with a large diversity of regulatory proteins, including neurotransmitter receptors (Changeux  2013a ), have lent support to, and further extended, the MWC model, emphasizing in particular “population shifts” within the energy landscape formalism (see Cui and Karplus  2008  ; Itoh and Sasai  2010 ; Changeux  2012a ,  2013a ; Terada et al.  2013 ; Motlagh et al.  2014 ; Tsai  2014 ). Importantly, both the MWC and KNF models formulate a  static  (end-point) equilibrium picture of the allosteric transition. To achieve progress toward the  dynamic  nature of the phenomenon, complementary and time-resolved analyses, such as molecular dynamics and novel technologies, were needed. As stated by Cui and Karplus ( 2008 ), inclusion of atomic fluctuations opens the way to a more sophisticated and accurate interpretation of protein activity that is essential for understanding the mechanism of allosteric interactions. In this review, I shall examine this issue with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), a neurotransmitter-gated ion channel, which has served in past decades as a privileged model of regulatory protein engaged in intercellular communication in the nervous system. On the basis of recently available crystallographic data, molecular dynamics models of the signal transduction process they mediate have been elaborated and compared with the in vivo physiological data. The concept of pharmacological receptor, the identification of the nicotinic receptor and the ionic response to acetylcholine Ever since Claude Bernard’s pioneering work on the effect of curare, the chemistry of intercellular communications has relied on the concept of the pharmacological “receptor” laid down by the English pharmacologist John Newport Langley ( 1905 ). It took however 65 years to chemically identify—through research involving the fish electric organ and a snake venom toxin—the first neurotransmitter receptor, the nicotinic receptor (nAChR) from the neuromuscular junction (Changeux et al.  1970 ; Miledi et al.  1971  ; Karlin  1993 ; for review, Changeux  2012b ). nAChRs are involved in many brain processes and diseases, such as attention, learning and memory, access to consciousness, nicotine addiction and Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases (for review, Changeux  2006 ,  2010 ). Understanding the functional organization and dynamics of these receptors at the atomic level is thus of considerable interest, both in itself and for the development of new therapeutics. nAChRs are integral allosteric membrane proteins with a molecular mass of approximately 290 kDa that form oligomers comprising five identical or homologous subunits symmetrically arranged around a central ion channel, with a fivefold symmetry axis perpendicular to the membrane (for review, Changeux and Edelstein  2005 ) (Fig.  1 ).The primary structure of each subunit consists of a large hydrophilic amino-terminal extracellular (EC) domain, a transmembrane (TM) domain comprising four hydrophobic segments (M1–M4) and a variable hydrophilic cytoplasmic or intracellular domain. There are two to five ACh binding sites within the EC domain located at the boundary between subunits. These ACh binding sites are far apart (approx. 60 Å) but still functionally linked to a single cationic ion channel located on the axis of symmetry of the TM domain and delineated by the M2 α-helix (Fig.  1 ). The interaction between neurotransmitter site and ion channel is thus typically “allosteric.” The EC and TM additionally carry several allosteric modulatory sites for natural (e.g. Ca ++ , lipids) and synthetic (e.g. ivermectin) ligands. Therefore, nAChRs possess the structural elements required to convert a chemical signal, typically a local increase in extracellular ACh concentration, into an electrical signal generated by the opening of the ion channel. Over the years the nAChR has become the “founding father” of the broader superfamily of pentameric receptors which includes the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor (5HT3R), the inhibitory anion-selective γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA A ) and glycine receptors and the invertebrate glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl) (Changeux  2012b ).

 An important outcome of Langley’s receptor theory ( 1905 ) was the development of electrophysiological recordings aimed at understanding the ionic response of receptors to neurotransmitters (Katz  1966 ) with the important addition of the time dimension missing in the biochemical–structural approach at the time. At the neuromuscular junction, the postsynaptic potential elicited by either electrical stimulation of the nerve ending or iontophoretic application of ACh has a fast (&lt;0.2 ms) signal rise time and a signal decay time of a few milliseconds. The local concentration of ACh transiently rises (&lt;1 ms) to 3 × 10 −4  M over a background release of 10 −8  M (Katz and Miledi  1973 ,  1977 ; Kuffler and Yoshikami  1975 ). These data were interpreted in terms of the then available models of enzyme kinetics, in particular acetylcholine esterase (Augustinsson  1948 ,  1950 ), assuming a two-step process which consisted of the formation of the receptor–ACh complex followed by opening of the channel (Del Castillo and Katz  1957 ). This model was consistent with Koshland’s induced-fit mechanism ( 1959 ): \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

 The application of patch-clamp recording techniques revealed that the cellular postsynaptic response can be reduced to the collective opening of separate molecular channels, with each individual opening having a square shape with a rise time in the microsecond range and a mean open time of a few milliseconds (Neher and Sakmann  1976 ). These values set the time-range for ongoing molecular dynamics studies (see below). Langley ( 1905 ) had already noticed that prolonged application of the agonist nicotine blocks receptor responses, resulting in desensitization of the receptor. To fit the electrophysiological data then available, Katz and Thesleff ( 1957 ) proposed that ACh slowly (on a 10 ms to 1 s timescale) stabilizes a new high-affinity closed (“refractory”) state of the receptor which, unlike the “effective” excitable state, would pre-exist ligand binding. Subsequent electrophysiological and biochemical studies with nAChR-rich “excitable” membrane fragments (Kasai and Changeux  1971 ; Cohen et al.  1972 ) and a fluorescent analog of acetylcholine (dansyl-C6-choline) enabled researchers to follow directly in vitro the binding kinetics of a nicotinic ligand and its conformational and ionic consequences without using in vivo electrophysiological recordings (Heidmann and Changeux  1979a ,  b ,  1980 ; Heidmann et al.  1980 , see also Neubig and Cohen  1980 ; Neubig et al.  1982  with radioactive ligands). Extensive kinetic analyses with an adequate rapid mixing apparatus (2.5-ms dead time) resulted in the first experimental in vitro demonstration in the millisecond range of the allosteric transitions of the receptor protein’s multiple conformational states: (1) a resting closed-channel R state stabilized by nicotinic antagonists; (2) an active, fast, open-channel A state with a low affinity for ACh and nicotinic agonists (kDa ACh: approx.50–100 μM); (3) at least a fast I and a slow D desensitized, refractory state, with higher affinities for agonists (but also for antagonists) [(kDa of I for ACh: approx.1 μM; kDa of D for ACh: approx. 3–5 nM] (Heidmann and Changeux  1980 ; see Edelstein et al.  1996 ). In contrast to a widespread opinion among pharmacologists, the highest affinity states do not correspond to the active functional state of the receptor—quite the contrary is true. The scheme presented below (Changeux  1990 ) illustrates the interconversion between the four different states. These states are postulated to occur spontaneously in the absence of ligands. Orthosteric and allosteric (see chapter 6 from Changeux  1990 ) ligands, binding differentially and selectively, stabilize the state(s) to which each ligand interacts with the highest affinity and, consequently, in the case of agonists (here ACh), mediate signal tranduction. Competitive blockers (CB) channel blockers (NCB) and/or allosteric modulators (AM) may selectively stabilize any of the states at the level of sites distinct from the ACh binding site and ion channel (see chapter 6 from Changeux  1990 ). 
 Moreover, a non-negligible fraction (approx. 20 %) of the receptor resides in the high-affinity D state in the total absence of ligand (Heidmann and Changeux  1979a ,  b ,  1980 ). In parallel studies, Jackson ( 1984 ) observed the spontaneous opening of muscle nAChR in the absence of ACh. Purohit and Auerbach ( 2013 ) have recently extended the analysis and elegantly demonstrated that “diliganded and brief unliganded openings are generated by the same essential, global transition”, thereby ruling out the induced-fit mechanism and validating the fundamental premises of the MWC model that the basic activation mechanism involves a unique R &lt;−−&gt; A conformational transition that is independent of ligand binding (Auerbach  2012 ,  2014 ). Crystallographic structure of prokaryotic and eukaryotic pentameric receptors An important step in the development of the molecular dynamics analysis of pentameric receptors was the availability of high-resolution structural data. Early electron micrographs of nAChR from fish electric organs (Cartaud et al.  1973 ; Brisson and Unwin  1985a ,  b ) together with the X-ray structure of the homopentameric, water-soluble acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP) from  Lymnaea stagnalis  (Brejc et al.  2001 ), which displays significant (approx. 30 %) sequence homology with the EC domain of the nAChRs and remarkable conservation of the binding site residues, led to the development of atomic models of the full-length nAChR (Unwin  2005 ,  2013 ) (see Taly et al.  2014  for discussion). However, the resolution remained low (&gt;4 Å) due to sample preparation conditions which unfortunately were known to “uncouple” receptor function (Paas et al.  2005 ; daCosta et al.  2013 ). The situation changed dramatically with the discovery in bacteria of DNA sequences homologous to eukaryotic nAChR (Tasneem et al.  2005 ) and the subsequent cloning and expression in eukaryotic cells of one of these sequences from the photosynthetic bacterium  Gloeobacter violaceus  (Bocquet et al.  2007 ). The protein was demonstrated by electrophysiological recordings to behave as a ligand-gated ion channel activated at acidic pHs (Bocquet et al.  2007 ). Purification and crystallization of the  G. violaceus  ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC) and of a closely related protein led to the resolution of the first X-ray structure of a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC) in a closed-channel state (resolution 3.3 Å) from  Erwinia chrysanthemi  (ELIC) (Hilf and Dutzler  2008 ) and in an open-channel conformation (resolution 2.9 Å) from  G. violaceus  (GLIC) (Bocquet et al.  2009 ; Hilf and Dutzler  2009 ). The structure of an eukaryotic member of the family, the anionic glutamate receptor from  Caenorhabditis elegans  (GluCl), was then solved in an open conformation as a complex with the positive allosteric modulator ivermectin, revealing an astonishing structural similarity with the three-dimensional (3D) structure of GLIC (Hibbs and Gouaux  2011 ). The recent crystallographic structures of the eukaryotic GABA A  receptor (Miller and Aricescu  2014 ) and 5HT 3  receptor (Hassaine et al.  2014 ) confirm a common structural organization of the constituent subunits. The EC domain folds into a highly conserved immunoglobulin-like β-sandwich and the TM domain consists of four α-helices organized as a well-conserved bundle [in agreement with the low-resolution electron microscopy structures of  Torpedo   nAChR (Unwin  2005 )]. The M2 helix lines the channel walls (Giraudat et al.  1986 ,  1987 ; Hucho et al.  1986 ; Imoto et al.  1986 ,  1988 ) and is surrounded by a ring of α-helices made of M1 and M3. The fourth TM α-helix, M4, is the most peripheral helix and interacts extensively with the lipid bilayer (Bocquet et al.  2009 ). Also, the cytoplasmic domain, absent in prokaryotic receptors, was revealed for the first time in 5HT3 receptors (Hassaine et al.  2014 ), further extending our structural knowledge of the family. The access to high-resolution full X-ray structures of pentameric receptors legitimated a reliable analysis of the dynamics of their conformational change. Early studies on the molecular dynamics of signal tranduction mediated by pentameric receptors Even before high-resolution structural data became accessible, Taly et al. ( 2005 ) developed, by comparative analysis, a 3D model of the α7-nAChR on which they performed the first, coarse-grained, molecular dynamics simulation of a pLGIC using the method referred to as “normal mode analysis.” By approximating the surface of the conformational landscape, the analysis decomposed the receptor protein movements into discrete modes. Among the ten modes with the lowest frequency, the first showed a structural reorganization described as a concerted rotation, in opposite directions, of the upper EC and lower TM domains around the pore axis—a movement referred to as a  quaternary twist . The twist affects the structure of the ion channel toward its opening and results in a significant reshaping of the subunits’ interfaces which open and close the agonist binding site(s) located at these interfaces. These observations were confirmed and extended with another model of α7-nAChR (Cheng et al.  2006 ), with the crystal structures of GLIC (Bocquet et al.  2009 ) and of ELIC (Cheng et al.  2009 ) and with a 1-μs-long all-atom molecular dynamics simulation of GLIC (Nury et al.  2010 ). In parallel, another computational study (Taly et al.  2006 ) on nAChR was undertaken, involving pathological mutations associated with congenital myasthenia and autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy. These mutations constitutively stabilize the receptor in an active open conformation, even in the absence of agonist. The substituted amino acids were found to be located at interfaces either between subunits or, within a given subunit, between rigid blocks and thus to alter the twisting mode. Taken together, these results support the conclusion that quaternary twisting is a robust structural motion that accompanies the opening of the ion channel and possibly other moves of the channel, such as those occurring during desensitization. In parallel electrophysiological studies, Auerbach and colleagues (Grosman et al.  2000 ; Purohit et al.  2007 ,  2013 ; Purohit and Auerbach  2013 ) examined the gating dynamics of muscle nAChR closed–open transition state ensembles (TSE). These authors measured the single-channel opening ( k 
 o ) and closing ( k 
 c ) rate constants of sets of receptor mutants with various side chain substitutions for individual amino acids. For each series of mutants, properties of the TSE could be deduced from ϕ (phi), the slope of a log–log plot of  k 
 o  versus  K 
 eq  ( k 
 o / k 
 c ). The analysis suggests that the overall nAChR isomerization consists of a well-defined sequence of protein domain motions that generate a propagated, Brownian stepwise process. Two separate regions in the α-subunits, namely, transmitter-binding sites and linkers in the membrane domain, have the highest ϕ values (i.e. change conformation the earliest), followed by the EC domain, then most of the membrane domain and finally the gate, resulting in channel opening (Purohit et al.  2013 ). Accordingly, the gating dynamics of muscle nAChR does not proceed as a single-step “rigid” event but through a concerted, step-wise, conformational mechanism that can be investigated by structural analysis and molecular dynamics simulations. Structural dynamics model of signal tranduction: an emerging model. On the basis of the GLIC open state, the ELIC “undefined” closed state and the GluCl open-channel structure (when bound to the positive allosteric modulator ivermectin), Calimet et al. ( 2013 ) carried out extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations in the timescale of 0.2–0.5 μs. Upon removal of ivermectin, the simulated trajectory of GluCl reveals a stepwise sequence of structural events that couple agonist unbinding from the EC domain to ion-pore closing in the TM domain. The simulation also shows that, in agreement with Taly et al. ( 2005 ), a global twisting initiates the closing transition from the open state by facilitating the (un)-tilting of the pore-lining helices. The mechanistic scenario emerging from the simulations suggested that receptor twisting contributes to the activation process by “locking” the ion channel in the open-pore form. In addition, a large reorientation or  tilting  of the extracellular β-sandwiches in the outward direction further contributes to the allosteric communication between the neurotransmitter-binding site and the ion pore. The crystal structures of GLIC at both pH 7 (closed) and pH 4 (open) further provided, for the first time, the end-point structures of the gating mechanism in the same pLGIC (Sauguet et al.  2014a ) and included a coarse-grained dynamic modeling of the structures (Sauguet et al.  2014a ) (Fig.  2 ). These data revealed the occurrence of a large  quaternary twisting  upon receptor activation, as well as the occurrence of important tertiary changes on activation, in particular a significant  tilting  of the M2 helices. Remarkably, the X-ray structures show, in agreement with Calimet et al. ( 2013 ), a radial expansion of the EC domain, termed  outward tilting  or  blooming , which reflects a reorientation of the β-sandwiches (Fig.  3 ). Fig. 2 Compared crystal structures of the closed (pH 7;  left ) and open (pH 4;  right ) channel states of the receptor from  G. violaceus  (GLIC).

 The recent data on GluCl structure in its  apo  resting conformation compared to that obtained in the presence of the positive allosteric modulator ivermectin appears, to some extent, to be consistent with some of the conformational changes identified with GLIC (Sauguet et al.  2014a ): a  twist  of the EC domain and a quaternary un- blooming  (“resembling the closure of a blossom”) occuring upon activation (Althoff et al.  2014 ). However,in the GluCl structure, functionally relevant tertiary changes, such as the detachment of the inner and outer β-sheets and the translation of the C-loop observed with GLIC, are not resolved. Also, differences in the global twist and in the detailed mechanism of reorientation of TM helices are noted. Unfortunately, no molecular dynamics data are available on the recent GluCl data (Althoff et al.  2014 ). The structure of a new “locally closed” (LC) state of GLIC—which shows a closed pore in a structure that preserves most of the features of the open form (Prevost et al.  2012 )—also brings into question the simple correlation between global twisting and the tilting of the pore-lining helices, an issue thoroughly discussed in Sauguet et al. ( 2014a ) and Cecchini and Changeux ( 2014 ). Lastly, X-ray analysis of  Lymnaea  AChBP complexed with a series of 4,6-disubstituted 2-aminopyrimidines exhibiting both positive and negative cooperativity in ligand-binding assays shows that cooperative interactions are associated with a global  blooming  of the AChBP molecule, yet without a significant  twist  (Kaczanowska et al.  2014 ). Taken together, the most recent molecular dynamics (Calimet et al.  2013 ; Sauguet et al.  2014a ; Taly et al.  2014 ; Cecchini and Changeux  2014 ), structural (Sauguet et al.  2014a ) and physiological (Purohit et al.  2013 ) studies converge on a common atomic model of the gating transition (Sauguet et al.  2014a ,  b ; Cecchini and Changeux  2014 ). According to the model, the “stepwise process” would start from the orthosteric-binding site (loops A, B and C), propagate to the EC/TM interface (β1– β2 loop and Cys loop) via a rigid-body rearrangement of the EC β-sandwiches and move down to the TM helices (first M2, then M4 and M3) to finally open the gate (Fig.  4 ). This process would involve two distinct sequential quaternary transitions: a radial concerted contraction or un- blooming  of the EC domain, which promotes opening of the ion pore, followed by a global concerted  twisting  of the receptor to lock the channel in the active, open channel, state. Fig. 4 Coarsed grained molecular dynamics trajectories for the gating of the ion channel of the  G. violaceus  receptor. Opening of the ion channel is  from right to left . The iENM web server ( http://enm.lobos.nih.gov ) was used to generate plausible trajectories between the four closed GLIC pH 7, the open GLIC pH 4 and the locally closed structures. The trajectories are mapped onto ECD and TMD reaction coordinates to quantify the differential progress of conformational change in these two domains. Residues belonging to structural segments (loops) are displayed with  colored symbols  (see color code on the  right ); all other residues are displayed with  small crosses . The figure illustrates the stepwise progress of the concerted conformational change:  from right to left  channel opening process starting at the ECD,  from left to right  channel closing process starting at the TMD. From Sauguet et al.  2014a , Figure S18c. 
 The data are consistent with single-channel recordings (Zheng and Auerbach  2011 ; Purohit et al.  2013 ) and their dynamics on a microsecond to millisecond timescale. They are also consistent with the MWC postulate that the conformational transition is “concerted” and, at the endpoints, conserves the symmetry of the oligomer. Furthermore, in agreement with the conformational selection mechanism, Sauguet et al. ( 2014a ) observed that in some crystal forms of GLIC pH 4, the locally closed and open conformations are found to coexist as discrete entities. Interestingly, the greater fluctuations observed in crystals of GLIC pH 7 prefigured the conformational change toward the open state—as if the latter was already “on-path” even under conditions which did not favor its occurrence. Finally, several fast and slow desensitized I and D states and uncoupled forms of prokaryotic receptors have been identified, and their structures are currently under investigation. For example, the locally closed state (Prevost et al.  2012 ) might be a fast desensitized I state (Prevost et al.  2013 ), and the closed state of ELIC—often considered to be a resting state (see Calimet et al.  2013 )—might represent a slowly desensitized D one (Velisetty et al.  2012 ; Sauguet et al.  2014a ). The ELIC structure has also been suggested to be in a “refractory” (Gonzalez-Gutierrez et al.  2012 )/“uncoupled” state (daCosta and Baenziger  2013 ) (see Cecchini and Changeux  2014  for discussion). Allosteric modulation of receptor function: toward a new pharmacology Several categories of allosteric sites modulate signal transduction mediated by nAChR. Ca 2+ , at millimolar concentrations, potentiates most neuronal nAChRs (Mulle et al.  1992 ; Vernino et al.  1992 ) and binds to sites located at the subunit interface of the EC domain, below the ACh site near the TM (Le Novere et al.  2002 ). In agreement with the MWC model, Ca 2+  primarily affects the isomerization constant between the R and open A conformation (Galzi et al.  1996 ). A second class of allosteric sites lies within the TM and accommodates pharmacological agents which regulate receptor activity in either a positive (e.g. the antihelminthic ivermectin; Krause et al.  1998 ) or a negative [e.g. general anesthetics (GAs; for review, Nury et al.  2011 ) or ethanol (Sauguet et al.  2013 )]. With mammalian GABA A  receptors, early studies by photoaffinity labeling with a derivative of the GA etomidate identified sites located both between and within subunits, in the TM domain (for review, Olsen  2014 ). Amazingly, GAs such as propofol and desflurane negatively modulate the response of the prokaryotic GLIC receptor. The X-ray structure of a GLIC–GA complex reveals that GAs bind to a common site within the upper part of the TM of each subunit inside a cavity accessible to phospholipids from the lipid bilayer (Nury et al.  2011 ). The entrance to this cavity is obstructed by a lipid alkyl chain that competes with propofol binding. Lipids, free fatty acids and steroids are known to allosterically modulate pLGICs and are thus likely candidates as endogenous ligands for the GA sites (Nury et al.  2011 ; Sauguet et al.  2013 ). Ivermectin, which positively modulates GluCl, binds to GluCl crystals at subunit interfaces between M3 and M1 (Hibbs and Gouaux  2011 ) and also competes with phospholipids (Althoff et al.  2014 ). It would appear that ivermectin is homologous to many important modulators of pentameric receptors, such as alcohols, anticonvulsants, anesthetics and diuretics (Sauguet et al.  2014b ). Molecular dynamic studies (Calimet et al.  2013 ; Sauguet et al.  2014a ,  b , Cecchini and Changeux  2014 ) of GluCl, and the crystal structures of GLIC pH 4 and pH 7 unambiguously show that the gating transitions involve a significant restructuring of the subunits’ interfaces. This restructuring includes a large contraction of the orthosteric sites in the R–A transition and a major change of the allosteric modulatory sites: widening of the homolog of the Ca 2+  site pocket in the pH 7 R state and stabilization by positive allosteric modulators (ivermectin) of the untwisted (open pore) configuration of the TM site (Sauguet et al  2014a ; Althoff et al  2014 ). From a drug design perspective, the model suggests as logical targets the orthosteric and allosteric sites present on these defined conformation(s)—rather than a single rigid binding site (Changeux  2012a ,  2013a ; Sauguet et al.  2014b ). It thus makes possible to selectively generate agonistic  versus  antagonistic-orthosteric or allosteric modulatory-ligands. The model also predicts that by altering the unliganded equilibrium between discrete conformational states, gene mutations may cause constitutive receptor activation (or inhibition) with important pathological consequences (Changeux and Edelstein  2005 ; Taly et al.  2006 ). Conclusions: receptor dynamics and higher brain functions The introduction of molecular dynamics approaches in the analysis of the allosteric transition in pLGIC has led to a description, at the atomic level, of the conformational change mediating signal transduction and its intramolecular propagation as a concerted stepwise process at physiological timescales. It has also catalyzed understanding of the signal transduction mechanism mediated by ion channels (for review, Christopoulos et al.  2014 ) and other classes of membrane receptors, such as the G protein-coupled receptors (for review Bouvier  2013 ), the tyrosine kinase receptors or, even, the nuclear receptors (for review, Changeux  2012a ,  2013b ; Christopoulos et al.  2014 ). The finding that some of the basic building blocks of the brain, such as the pentameric receptors, have not markedly changed for 3 billion years raises an interesting issue. The dynamics of our brain processes, including our mental ones, are constrained by the timescale of conformational transitions that originated in bacteria. This constraint possibly explains why our brain, which processes propagating signals below the speed of sound, looks so slow compared to computers operating at the speed of light. These investigations further document and enrich what may be referred to as a “chemical theory of higher brain functions” (Changeux  1983 ,  2013b ). Within this framework, would our ultimate mental processes rest upon the biochemical world of allosteric transitions that mediate interneuronal communications across the multiple levels of organization that span the human brain? </Body>

    <Title>Structural and biophysical properties of the integrin-associated cytoskeletal protein talin</Title>

    <Abstact>Talin is a large cytoskeletal protein (2541 amino acid residues) which plays a key role in integrin-mediated events that are crucial for cell adhesion, migration, proliferation and survival. This review summarises recent work on the structure of talin and on some of the structurally better defined interactions with other proteins. The N-terminal talin head (approx. 50 kDa) consists of an atypical FERM domain linked to a long flexible rod (approx. 220 kDa) made up of a series of amphipathic helical bundle domains. The F3 FERM subdomain in the head binds the cytoplasmic tail of integrins, but this interaction can be inhibited by an interaction of F3 with a helical bundle in the talin rod, the so-called “autoinhibited form” of the molecule. The talin rod contains a second integrin-binding site, at least two actin-binding sites and a large number of binding sites for vinculin, which is important in reinforcing the initial integrin–actin link mediated by talin. The vinculin binding sites are defined by hydrophobic residues buried within helical bundles, and these must unfold to allow vinculin binding. Recent experiments suggest that this unfolding may be mediated by mechanical force exerted on the talin molecule by actomyosin contraction.</Abstact>
    <Body>Introduction Integrins are a large family of cell-surface type 1 transmembrane adhesion receptors that mediate both cell–cell and cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. Integrins also have the unusual ability to support bidirectional signalling. Thus, the binding of integrins to the ECM potentiates the ability of growth factors to activate intracellular pathways that regulate cell proliferation, survival and migration ("outside-in signalling"), whilst the affinity of integrins for ECM proteins can be regulated from within the cell, the so-called "inside-out signalling" (Hynes  2002 ). Integrins are heterodimers of α and β subunits, each containing a large extracellular domain (approx. 80–150 kDa), a single transmembrane α-helix and a short, largely unstructured, cytoplasmic domain or “tail” of 10–70 residues. In mammals, one of 18 α-subunits interacts with one of eight β-subunits to form 24 distinct integrins, each with specific but overlapping functions (Hynes  2002 ).The current state of knowledge of integrins and integrin signalling is the topic of a recent special issue of the  Journal of Cell Science  (vol 122, issue 2, 2009). Cell adhesion to the ECM is fundamental to the development of multi-cellular organisms and involves the coordinated assembly and disassembly of integrins into complexes called focal adhesions. In these complexes, the internal tails of integrin β-subunits are typically linked to the actin cytoskeleton via cytoplasmic proteins with scaffolding, adaptor, regulatory and mechanotransduction functions (Legate and Fassler  2009 ; Zaidel-Bar et al.  2007 ). An analysis of the proteins that are currently known to assemble into focal adhesions identified 90 core components physically located at adhesion sites (Zaidel-Bar et al.  2007 ), and 42 proteins have been identified that reportedly bind just to the cytoplasmic tails of β-integrins (Legate and Fassler  2009 ). Among these proteins, the cytoskeletal protein talin has been shown to play a pivotal role in integrin-mediated events (Critchley  2009 ; Critchley and Gingras  2008 ). Talin promotes integrin clustering (Cluzel et al.  2005 ) and the switching of integrins from a low to high affinity state (Calderwood  2004 ; Harburger and Calderwood  2009 ; Tadokoro et al.  2003 ), although this also requires the kindlin family of proteins (Larjava et al.  2008 ). Talin also provides a direct link between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton (Jiang et al.  2003 ; Zhang et al.  2008 ) and acts as a scaffold for the recruitment of other proteins, such as vinculin (Ziegler et al.  2006 ). In this review we focus on recent studies of the structure and biophysics of talin, the results of which are beginning to throw light on the relationship between the structural and dynamic properties of this molecule and its function in the cell. The domain structure of talin There are two talin genes in vertebrates (Monkley et al.  2001 ; Senetar and McCann  2005 ). These code for talin1 and talin2, respectively, which are both large proteins (2541 amino acids; approx. 270 kDa) consisting of a globular N-terminal head (approx. 50 kDa) and a large flexible C-terminal rod (approx. 220 kDa) (Fig.  1 ). The talin head contains a FERM domain (residues 86–400) composed of F1, F2 and F3 domains. While initial attempts to crystallise the entire FERM domain have been unsuccessful to date, probably due to a large unstructured loop in F1 (Goult et al., in preparation), the crystal structure of the F2F3 fragment (Garcia-Alvarez et al.  2003 ) confirmed its structural similarity to the corresponding part of other FERM domains, with the F3 domain having a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB)-like fold (Fig.  1 ). The 85 amino acids preceding F1 were initially ignored, but recent nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies show that they constitute a folded domain, the F0 domain, which has a ubiquitin-like fold (Goult et al., in preparation) as does the F1 domain. The structure of an F0F1 double domain construct with the flexible F1 loop removed shows a well-defined and rather rigid interface between the two domains (Goult et al., in preparation) (Fig.  1 ).

Helices which bind vinculin are shown in  red . Cartoon representations are shown for those domains whose structure has been determined (see text for references) 
 The talin rod contains 62 helices that are organised into a series of helical bundles followed by a single C-terminal helix that forms an antiparallel homodimer (Gingras et al.  2008 ) (Fig.  1 ). Given the flexibility of the rod, the relative orientation of the two talin molecules within the dimer is uncertain. The rod starts with a five-helix bundle (residues 482–655) (Papagrigoriou et al.  2004 ); the crystal structure of talin 482–789 shows that residues 656–789 form a four-helix bundle that packs tightly against the talin 482–655 five-helix bundle in a staggered arrangement which is stabilised by an extensive hydrophobic interface (Papagrigoriou et al.  2004 ). The C-terminal half of the rod is also made up of a series of five-helix bundles (Cheung et al.  2009 ; Gingras et al.  2006 ,  2008 , 2009 ; Goult et al.  2009 ), but in this region a relatively flexible interface and end-to-end packing between the helical bundles seems to be typical. The central part of the rod also contains four- and five-helix bundles, but their packing with respect to one another has not yet been established with certainty. Biophysical and electron microscopy (EM) studies suggest that talin exists in several different conformational states. Thus, sedimentation equilibrium experiments show that it can exist as both monomers and dimers (Molony et al.  1987 ). Sedimentation velocity, gel filtration and EM studies indicate that it is globular in low salt buffers, whereas it is a flexible elongated molecule (approx. 60 nm in length) in 0.15  M  salt and appears to have 10–12 globular domains (Molony et al.  1987 ; Winkler et al.  1997 ). The globular state appears to be dependent on a head/rod interaction, and recent data have provided insights into the structural basis of this interaction (Goksoy et al.  2008 ; Goult et al.  2009 ). Protein partners of talin The role of talin as an adaptor protein in linking integrins to the cytoskeleton and to signalling pathways in the cell is clearly indicated by the large number of proteins that have been shown to interact with talin (Critchley  2009 ; Critchley and Gingras  2008 ; Zaidel-Bar et al.  2007 ). Only a small number of the structurally better characterised interactions will be considered here. The talin F3 FERM domain binds the cytoplasmic domains of β-integrin subunits (Calderwood et al.  2002 ) and the hyaluronan receptor layilin (Borowsky and Hynes  1998 ; Wegener et al.  2008 ) as well as the C-terminal region of PIPKIγ90 (Barsukov et al.  2003 ; de Pereda et al.  2005 ; Di Paolo et al.  2002 ; Ling et al.  2002 ), a splice variant of phosphatidylinositol(4)- phosphate-5-kinase type Iγ which regulates the assembly of focal adhesions. The talin head also contains an F-actin binding site (Lee et al.  2004 ) and binds acidic phospholipids (e.g. Dietrich et al.  1993 ; Goldmann et al.  1995 ; Niggli et al.  1994 ). The talin rod contains a second integrin binding site, IBS2 (Gingras et al.  2009 ; Moes et al.  2007 ; Rodius et al.  2008 ; Tremuth et al.  2004 ; Xing et al.  2001 ) and at least two actin-binding sites (Hemmings et al.  1996 ), the best characterised of which is at the C-terminus (Gingras et al.  2008 ; McCann and Craig  1997 ; Senetar et al.  2004 ; Smith and McCann  2007 ). Importantly, the rod also contains multiple binding sites for vinculin (Gingras et al.  2005 ), which itself has numerous binding partners, including F-actin (Ziegler et al.  2006 ); the “cross-linking” of talin to actin by vinculin has been proposed to stabilise the initial weak integrin/talin/F-actin complexes (Bakolitsa et al.  2004 ). Integrin binding As noted above, the talin F3 domain has a PTB-like fold; canonical ligands of PTB domains are peptides containing an NPxY-like motif sequence. The short cytoplasmic tails of β-integrin subunits contain two such motifs, and the talin F3 FERM domain selectively binds to the membrane proximal to these,  744 NPLY 747  (Campbell and Ginsberg  2004 ). The structure of F3 bound to residues  739 WDTANNPLYDEA 750  of the β3-integrin tail (Garcia-Alvarez et al.  2003 ) shows that the integrin peptide interacts predominantly with the hydrophobic surface on strand S5 of the F3 domain; W739 inserts into a pocket on the talin surface, with the subsequent residues forming a β-strand that extends the sheet formed by strands 5–7 of the F3 domain. Y747 projects into an acidic pocket in F3, whereas the equivalent region in those PTB domains that bind phosphotyrosine is strongly basic. More recent studies have shown that F3 also interacts with the membrane-proximal helix of the β3-tail; F727 and F730, which are on the same face of this helix, bind to a hydrophobic pocket in F3 made up of the flexible loop between β-strands 1 and 2 (Wegener et al.  2007 ). A mutation of either F727 or F730 in β3-integrin, or of the interacting residues in F3 (notably L325), markedly reduced the activation of αIIbβ3 integrin (Wegener et al.  2007 ). These authors propose that talin F3 initially binds to β3-integrin  744 NPxY 747  and subsequently to the membrane-proximal helix, thereby breaking the salt bridge between the α- and β-integrin tails which locks the integrin in a low affinity state. This hypothesis is supported by results from bimolecular fluorescence complementation studies in cells in which a talin L325R mutant was recruited to αIIbβ3-integrin tails but was unable to activate the integrin (Watanabe et al.  2008 ). However, talin F3 alone is not sufficient to activate β1-integrins, and the F0 and F1 domains are also required (Bouaouina et al.  2008 ). A variety of experiments indicate that the integrin binding sites in full-length talin are masked (Calderwood  2004 ; Martel et al.  2001 ), and recent NMR studies show that this is due to an interaction between the talin head and rod (Goksoy et al.  2008 ). Talin F3 was shown to bind to a talin rod fragment spanning residues 1654–2344, partially masking the binding site in F3 for the membrane-proximal helix of the β3 integrin tail. This rod fragment contained higher affinity (residues 1654–1848) and lower affinity (residues 1984–2344) F3 binding sites. The domain boundaries of the region containing the high affinity site have now been defined structurally (Goult et al.  2009 ). The domain (residues 1655–1822) forms a five-helix bundle, and the positively charged integrin activation loop in F3 binds to a cluster of acidic residues, predominantly on helix 4, masking the binding site for the β3 integrin tail. The interaction is also expected to inhibit sterically the association of the talin FERM domain with the membrane. These results establish a structural basis for the “autoinihibited” form of talin. The mechanisms which disrupt this interaction to activate talin require further investigation, although the small GTPase Rap1 and its binding partner RIAM have been shown to play a key role in talin activation (Han et al.  2006 ; Lee et al.  2009 ; Watanabe et al.  2008 ), and PIPKIγ90 and PIP2 have also been implicated (Goksoy et al.  2008 ; Ling et al.  2002 ; Ling et al.  2003 ; Martel et al.  2001 ). There is evidence for a second integrin binding site (IBS2) towards the C-terminal end of the talin rod (Tremuth et al.  2004 ; Xing et al.  2001 ), which has been suggested to correspond to a single predicted helix (Moes et al.  2007 ; Rodius et al.  2008 ). A crystal structure has recently been reported for the region of the rod containing IBS2: mouse talin residues 1974–2293 (Gingras et al.  2009 ) comprises two five-helix bundles—“IBS2-A” (1974–2139) and “IBS2-B” (2140–2293)—connected by a continuous helix. The single helix previously identified as IBS2 corresponds to helix 4 in IBS2-A. However, tight integrin binding and targeting to focal adhesions appears to require  both  the IBS2-A and IBS2-B domains (Gingras et al.  2009 ), and it remains to be established exactly how this region of the rod binds to integrins. The C-terminal actin binding site in the rod Talin has binding sites for actin in the head (the F2F3 region) and in two distinct regions of the rod (Critchley  2009 ; Hemmings et al.  1996 ). The structure of the C-terminal actin binding site of talin1 (Gingras et al.  2008 ) comprises a five-helix bundle (residues 2300–2482), similar to the homologous region of the HIP1R protein (Brett et al.  2006 ); this domain is now referred to as a THATCH domain. The actin binding site maps to a conserved hydrophobic surface on helices 3 and 4 of the five-helix bundle that is flanked by basic residues. Interestingly, helix 1, which packs against the opposite face of the bundle, negatively regulates actin binding (Senetar et al.  2004 ). Deletion of this helix or the mutation of residues involved in its packing against the remainder of the bundle significantly increases actin binding (Gingras et al.  2008 ; Senetar et al.  2004 ), and there appear to be significant structural changes upon removal of the helix (Gingras et al.  2008 ). The C-terminal helix of talin forms an antiparallel coiled-coil dimer (Gingras et al.  2008 ). F-actin only binds efficiently to the THATCH dimer, residues 2300–2541 (Gingras et al.  2008 ; Smith and McCann  2007 ), and residues on one face of the dimerisation helix may also contribute to actin binding (Gingras et al.  2008 ). SAXS experiments indicate that the THATCH dimer adopts an elongated structure in solution, and the high-resolution structures of the five-helix bundle and dimerisation domain can be readily modeled within the SAXS envelope. EM studies show that the THATCH dimer binds to three actin monomers along the long pitch of the same actin filament (Gingras et al.  2008 ); it does not cross-link F-actin—presumably, the actin-bundling activity of talin is explained by the presence of the other actin binding sites in talin. Binding of vinculin to the talin rod Vinculin is a 116-kDa actin-binding protein that is localised in focal adhesions. It is made up of a globular head linked to a tail domain by a proline-rich region, and interaction sites for numerous binding partners have been mapped onto all three regions of the protein (Bakolitsa et al.  2004 ; Borgon et al.  2004 ; Ziegler et al.  2006 ). All of the well-characterised ligand-binding sites in vinculin (including that for talin) are masked by an intramolecular interaction between the vinculin head and tail domains (Bakolitsa et al.  2004 ; Borgon et al.  2004 ; Cohen et al.  2005 ; Izard et al.  2004 ; Johnson and Craig  1994 ,  1995a ,  b ), and the molecule is thought to exist in an equilibrium between active and inactive states. Initial studies identified at least three vinculin binding sites (VBSs) in the talin rod, and these were localised to three short peptide sequences (VBS1–3), each corresponding to a single predicted α-helix (Bass et al.  1999 ). A systematic analysis of the binding of vinculin to peptides corresponding to each of the 62 helices of the rod revealed as many as 11 VBSs (Gingras et al.  2005 ), although it is clear that not all of these are available in the intact protein in vitro (Patel et al.  2006 ). The talin-binding site in vinculin has been localised to residues 1–258 within the vinculin head (Bass et al.  2002 ), a helical domain (Vd1) which binds the vinculin tail (Vt) with high affinity (Gilmore and Burridge  1996 ; Johnson and Craig  1994 ). Binding the talin VBS3 peptide induces a marked conformational change in Vd1 that displaces Vt, and the VBS3 peptide itself sits in a hydrophobic groove formed predominantly by helices 1 and 2 of Vd1 (Izard et al.  2004 ). Similar results have been reported for Vd1 in complex with other VBSs (Fillingham et al.  2005 ; Gingras et al.  2005 ; Papagrigoriou et al.  2004 ). The structure of the N-terminal part of the talin rod (residues 482– 655) shows that it consists of a 5-helix bundle in which helix 4 is equivalent to VBS1 (Papagrigoriou et al.  2004 ). The key vinculin-binding determinants are five hydrophobic residues (L608, A612, L615, V619 and L623) on one face of the VBS1 helix which are normally buried within the hydrophobic core of the five-helix bundle. Comparison of the structure of the Vd1/VBS1 complex with that of talin 482–655 shows that Vd1 helices 1–4 occupy the equivalent positions in relation to the VBS1 helix as do helices 1, 5, 2 and 3 in the talin 482–655 five-helix bundle, and key hydrophobic contacts are maintained by interactions with similar side chains in Vd1. Thus, the VBS1 helix (helix 4) is extracted from its own five-helix bundle and forms an equivalent five-helix bundle with the four helices of Vd1 (Papagrigoriou et al.  2004 ) (Fig.  2 ).

Data from Gingras et al. ( 2006 ) 
 This striking observation implies that the helical bundle of talin 482–655 must unfold to allow the vinculin binding sequence to bind in the hydrophobic groove of the vinculin head. While there are now many examples of proteins which are intrinsically disordered but which adopt a well-defined three-dimensional structure on binding to a protein or nucleic acid partner (e.g. Dyson and Wright  2005 ; Sugase et al.  2007 ), the observation of a protein which exists in a stable folded conformation but which must unfold in order to interact with a partner protein is much more unusual. Observations by a range of different biochemical and biophysical techniques have demonstrated this unusual “unfolding for binding” behaviour in VBS-containing constructs from different parts of the rod. These include:
 The talin 482–655 five-helix bundle binds Vd1 only weakly. Removal of the C-terminal helix destabilises the helical bundle and leads to the partial unfolding of the protein, as shown by NMR, yet this is accompanied by tighter binding to vinculin (Papagrigoriou et al.  2004 ). Talin 482–655 is stable to proteolysis by trypsin, whereas the four-helix construct talin 482–636 is readily degraded. In the complex of Vd1 with talin 482–636, Vd1 and the VBS1 sequence within the talin domain become stable to proteolysis, but all of the remaining talin helices are degraded (Papagrigoriou et al.  2004 ). In the [ 1 H, 15 N]-HSQC NMR spectrum of the complex between Vd1 and  15 N-labeled talin 1843–1973, fewer cross-peaks are observed compared to the free protein, and these have a much smaller chemical shift dispersion. Cross-peaks which are not observed in the complex map onto helix H4 (the helix that binds vinculin), the C-terminal half of helix H3, and a short stretch at the C-terminus of helix H1. The highest cross-peak intensities correspond to helix H2 and the N-terminal part of helix H3 (Gingras et al.  2006 ). This provides direct evidence for substantial conformational mobility of those parts of the talin domain which are not in contact with vinculin, and hence for the unfolding of the helical bundle. Similar observations were made with talin 755–889 (Fillingham et al.  2005 ). The talin 755–889 4-helix bundle has two threonine pairs (T775/T809 and T833/T867) within the hydrophobic core of the bundle (Fillingham et al.  2005 ). A mutant in which these were replaced by isoleucine/valine pairs (T775V/T809I/T833I/T867V) was much more stable than the wild-type construct but bound Vd1 much more weakly (Patel et al.  2006 ). The effects of vinculin Vd1 binding on talin 1843–1973 have been studied by site-directed spin-labeling (Gingras et al.  2006 ). Cysteine residues were placed at key positions by mutagenesis; these were labeled with a nitroxide spin label to give singly or doubly spin-labeled proteins. Analysis of the EPR spectra to obtain information on the local mobility and on the distances between the nitroxides (Fig.  2 ) provided clear evidence that, on binding Vd1, the helical bundle unfolds as do at least two of the constituent helices, the VBS-containing helix 4 being immobilised in the complex. 
 The activation of vinculin binding to talin The variations in the stability of the individual helical bundles that make up the talin rod are undoubtedly significant factors in determining vinculin binding. For the isolated domains, one could envisage either that the talin bundle is dynamic, and unfolds spontaneously to release the VBS which then binds to Vd1, or that an initial interaction of Vd1 with the folded talin bundle promotes unfolding of the latter. However, it is clear that the majority of the VBSs in intact talin are in a cryptic or low affinity state (Patel et al.  2006 ). Therefore, it appears that addition of vinculin is not in itself sufficient to lead to their activation. Talin is required for the formation of the initial weak linkage between a fibronectin/integrin complex and actomyosin (Jiang et al.  2003 ), but reinforcement of this link by the recruitment of additional components is thought to be essential for focal adhesion assembly. Activation of the cryptic VBSs could increase the number of vinculin molecules bound simultaneously to talin and, because the vinculin tail binds F-actin (Ziegler et al.  2006 ), a progressive increase in vinculin binding to talin could provide a mechanism for a graduated strengthening of the link between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton. Since talin is clearly subject to the force exerted by actomyosin contraction and given that external mechanical force induces focal adhesion assembly (Galbraith et al.  2002 ), we have proposed that mechanical stretch may activate the VBSs in talin (Gingras et al.  2005 ; Papagrigoriou et al.  2004 ; Ziegler et al.  2006 ). Direct evidence for this has recently come from elegant single molecule experiments on talin 482–889 reported by the Sheetz laboratory (del Rio et al.  2009 ). A construct containing residues 482–889 with a His-tag at the N-terminus and a biotin tag at the C-terminus was bound at one end to a Ni-NTA glass surface and at the other to an avidinated magnetic bead; the molecule could then be stretched by magnetic tweezers, and the binding of fluorescently labelled vinculin head detected by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. In the absence of mechanical force, binding of at most a single molecule of vinculin could be detected, which is consistent with earlier conclusions that many of the VBSs in this region are cryptic (Patel et al.  2006 ). However, the application of a force of 12pN to the talin led to a clear increase in the number of vinculin molecules bound, up to as many as three. Parallel force extension experiments showed mechanical unfolding of talin 482–889. These experiments demonstrate clearly that force-induced stretching can expose previously cryptic binding sites for vinculin in the N-terminal part of the talin rod (Fig.  3 ).

 The pathway by which mechanical force unfolds talin bundles remains to be established, but recent steered molecular dynamics simulations on talin 482–889 (Hytonen and Vogel  2008 ) give an indication of the possibilities. The structure assumed for talin 482–889 was a five-helix bundle packed against a seven-helix bundle; this is a model (Fillingham et al.  2005 ) rather than an experimental structure. Two kinds of simulation were carried out: one in which the force was applied to the N– and C-termini of the molecule and one in which it was applied laterally in a distributed fashion along the length of the two terminal helices. In both cases, the structure broke apart during the simulation into three components, comprising helices 1–5, 6–8 and 9–12. However, when the force was applied to the termini, this was preceded by the unraveling of helices 1 and 12, followed by partial unraveling of helix 2, so that at least one of the VBSs (helix 12) would be in a random coil state and would have to re-form its helical conformation to bind vinculin. The different behaviour according to the direction of the applied force is interesting and may imply different unfolding and activation mechanisms for VBSs within domains in different parts of the rod. In the N-terminal region, where successive bundles pack closely against one another, the mechanical force is likely to act laterally on the helices, whereas in the C-terminal half of the rod, where the bundles have relatively flexible interfaces and end-to-end packing seems to be typical, the force would most probably act through the N– and C-termini of each bundle. Conclusion It is clear that a picture of talin in which it binds at one end to integrin and at the other to actin is too simplistic. Both the talin head and rod contain binding sites for integrins and F-actin, although the significance of this remains to be established. Both the head and the rod also bind acidic phospholipids, and it will be important to establish whether the molecule lies along the cytoplasmic face of the membrane. It is also clear that talin exists in several conformational states (monomer/dimer and open and closed states). Much of talin exists in the cytoplasm in an autoinhibited form in which the talin rod masks the integrin binding site in the talin head, and the relative importance of the Rap1/RIAM and PIPKIγ90/PIP2 pathways in talin activation remain to be explored. Moreover, it has now been established from in vitro studies that the conformation of the talin rod is regulated by force, and it will be necessary to develop methods that allow this and the recruitment of vinculin to integrin/talin/actin complexes to be explored in real time and in a cellular context.

    <Abstact>Recent structural observations of kinesin-1, the founding member of the kinesin group of motor proteins, have led to substantial gains in our understanding of this molecular machine. Kinesin-1, similar to many kinesin family members, assembles to form homodimers that use alternating ATPase cycles of the catalytic motor domains, or “heads”, to proceed unidirectionally along its partner filament (the microtubule) via a hand-over-hand mechanism. Cryo-electron microscopy has now revealed 8-Å resolution, 3D reconstructions of kinesin-1•microtubule complexes for all three of this motor’s principal nucleotide-state intermediates (ADP-bound, no-nucleotide, and ATP analog), the first time filament co-complexes of any cytoskeletal motor have been visualized at this level of detail. These reconstructions comprehensively describe nucleotide-dependent changes in a monomeric head domain at the secondary structure level, and this information has been combined with atomic-resolution crystallography data to synthesize an atomic-level "seesaw" mechanism describing how microtubules activate kinesin’s ATP-sensing machinery. The new structural information revises or replaces key details of earlier models of kinesin’s ATPase cycle that were based principally on crystal structures of free kinesin, and demonstrates that high-resolution characterization of the kinesin–microtubule complex is essential for understanding the structural basis of the cycle. I discuss the broader implications of the seesaw mechanism within the cycle of a fully functional kinesin dimer and show how the seesaw can account for two types of "gating" that keep the ATPase cycles of the two heads out of sync during processive movement.</Abstact>
    <Body>Introduction More than many enzymes, the molecular motor proteins invite descriptive, mechanical terms such as "piston", "driveshaft", and "cam" to explain their mechanism of action. The kinesin molecular motor is commonly understood to deliver a kind of "power stroke" with its "force-delivering element", the neck linker, to engage in a "hand-over-hand", "walking" movement. The power stroke is itself proposed to be actuated by a "piston-like" or "seesaw-like" movement of an element known as the "relay helix" (Vale and Milligan  2000 ). These mechanical analogies, however, are necessarily incomplete, not least because the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP/Pi products, which is a purely chemical step, lies at the heart of the mechanism. Indeed, a major motivation for the study of molecular motors is to understand how chemical energy is converted to directed movement, in a "chemo-mechanical" cycle. As such, exploration of kinesin’s mechanism provides one avenue to better understanding the overall energetics of protein folding and conformational change. More than two decades of intensive study have established that the kinesin motor domain undergoes the following biochemical transitions during its ATPase cycle (Fig.  1 ): (1) weak attachment to the microtubule in the motor’s ADP-bound form; (2) release of ADP to form a tightly attached motor–microtubule complex; (3) binding of ATP, which triggers a significant conformational rearrangement of the motor domain, associated with a displacement of the cargo attachment point (the "neck linker", see below) in the direction of travel; and (4) hydrolysis of ATP and release of phosphate, which leads to concurrent detachment of the motor domain from the microtubule (Gilbert and Johnson  1994 ; Ma and Taylor  1995 ).

( 1999 ), the neck linker is depicted in a disordered conformation in the first two nucleotide states, and is docked along the head towards the microtubule plus end in the ATP state.  e ,  f  Overview of the atomic structure of kinesin-1 obtained by X-ray crystallography and fitted into a high-resolution cryo-EM map together with the atomic structure of tubulin (Sindelar and Downing  2010 ). Key structural elements are labeled 
 Deriving the structural basis for the above steps is clearly critical for better understanding of the motor mechanism. However, a principle difficulty in structural analysis of the kinesin system, as with the other two known cytoskeletal motors (myosin and dynein), has been the inability to obtain atomic-resolution structures of the motor while complexed to the partner filament. To date, the only atomic-resolution structural data available for kinesin comes from X-ray crystal structures of the molecule by itself (Marx et al.  2009 ) or in complex with a regulatory partner (Vinogradova et al.  2009 ). However, kinesin’s enzymatic properties change markedly in the absence of microtubules, where for example the ATPase rate drops to a basal level ∼1,000-fold reduced over the motile, microtubule-attached state (Hackney  1988 ). Such crystal structures, while highly informative, are not necessarily accurate depictions of the enzyme during the actual force-generating process, during which the microtubule is a required substrate. This shortcoming is highlighted by the observation that most crystal structures of kinesin—with one recent exception (Parke et al.  2010 )—do not exhibit a hydrolytically competent conformation of the ATP binding site even in the presence of non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs (Kikkawa et al.  2001 ; Nitta et al.  2004 ). The current inability of X-ray crystallography to characterize the kinesin–microtubule complex has motivated the use of an alternative structural method, high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), to fill the gap (Kikkawa  2008 ). Most cryo-EM studies on kinesin published to date, however, are limited to ≥10-Å resolution. This has meant that atomic-level structure in the motor–microtubule complex must be inferred from a combination of crystallography and the EM data. Unfortunately, at ≥10-Å resolution the structural analysis of cryo-EM data has been principally limited to rigid-body fitting of known crystal structures into the resulting 3D maps. As the resolution of a reconstruction drops below 10 Å, however, cryo-EM begins to resolve secondary structure details unambiguously, which can allow subdomain conformations in various crystal structures to be matched to features in the maps. Recent studies have now begun to achieve this goal for the kinesins (Sindelar and Downing  2007 ; Bodey et al.  2009 ; Sindelar and Downing  2010 ). Here I discuss how a recently introduced "seesaw" model (Sindelar and Downing  2010 ), derived from cryo-EM reconstructions of kinesin-1 that now consistently achieve 8-Å resolution in all three of the motor’s principal nucleotide states (ADP, no-nucleotide, and ATP analog-bound), may be used to advance our understanding of conventional kinesin-1. I place particular emphasis on how the motor co-modulates its interactions with the microtubule and the nucleotide together within a single catalytic domain. As I discuss, the seesaw model provides an intuitive, atomic-level description of the fundamental biophysical forces that drive kinesin’s ATP-sensing machinery, although the functional changes associated with ADP release, a key piece of the motile mechanism, still remain largely unexplained. Based on the "seesaw" mechanism, I introduce a novel model detailing the coordination between two dimerized "walking" motor domains. Modulating neck linker conformation and microtubule affinity: two proposed roles for the switch II helix The atomic architecture of kinesin reveals that this motor possesses Walker-type nucleotide-sensing “switch” motifs common to a broad swath of ATPase and GTPase enzymes (Sablin et al.  1996 ). An important observation relating to the functioning of these motifs was that the switch II sensor loop is immediately N-terminal to the "switch II helix" that forms a major part of kinesin’s microtubule binding interface (see Table  1  and Fig.  2  for definitions of the switch regions and other key structural elements). Moreover, the switch II helix extends across the full width of the motor domain (Fig.  1f ), reaching from the nucleotide cleft across to the opposite side where the C terminus of the catalytic domain emerges and (in conventional kinesins) attaches to cargo, via a putative force-generating element called the neck linker. This arrangement therefore suggested an elegant structural scheme for motor function whereby ATP binding in the motor would simultaneously modulate the microtubule binding affinity and also lead to cargo translocation, with both actions controlled via switch-loop-modulated changes in the geometry of the switch II helix (Kull et al.  1996 ; Sablin et al.  1996 ; Vale and Milligan  2000 ). Each of these of these putative functional roles for the switch II helix, modulation of microtubule attachment affinity and modulation of the conformation of the neck linker, constitutes a prediction which can be tested by structural and biophysical methods.

 Perhaps the most direct test of the switch II helix’s proposed functional roles has been via high-resolution cryo-EM studies of the kinesin–microtubule complex. A number of such studies have reported nucleotide-induced swiveling of the kinesin core domain relative to the switch II helix, which appears to remain in a fixed position relative to the microtubule surface (Kikkawa et al.  2001 ; Kikkawa and Hirokawa  2006 ; Sindelar and Downing  2010 ). This swiveling has been interpreted to support a role for the switch II helix in modulating microtubule affinity (Kikkawa et al.  2001 ), aptly described as a “twist-off” scheme (Schliwa and Woehlke  2001 ). In the twist-off scheme, the presence or absence of the γ-phosphate moiety would trigger changes in the shape of the motor’s microtubule binding interface via swiveling of the switch II helix. These and other studies have also reported nucleotide-dependent conformational transitions of the neck linker such that this element is mostly disordered in non-ATP-bound state of the motor, but docks along the motor domain in the ATP state (see Fig.  1 ). This docking transition appears closely coupled to the orientation of the switch II helix on the motor domain, in support of a role for the switch II helix in docking the neck linker (Vale and Milligan  2000 ; Kikkawa et al.  2001 ). Coupling between the switch II helix and the neck linker conformation is further supported by crystallographic observations of "ADP-like" and "ATP-like" arrangements of these elements, such that the C-terminal end of the switch II helix would displace the docked neck linker conformation in the former arrangement, but open up a complementary hydrophobic pocket that facilitates docking in the latter conformation, providing a kind of "power stroke" (Vale and Milligan  2000 ). Thus, a significant body of structural evidence supports a role for the switch II helix both in the modulation of microtubule attachment affinity as well as modulation of neck linker conformation, via nucleotide-controlled transitions between "ADP-like" and "ATP-like" orientations of the switch II helix. Two key questions relating to proposed roles of the switch II helix The above described scheme leaves at least two key problems relating to motor function. The first is how microtubules activate kinesin’s ATP-sensing functions: microtubules are required to accelerate catalysis and also to enable ATP-induced docking of the neck linker. A second problem is why ADP triggers motor detachment from the microtubule, while the no-nucleotide motor state remains very tightly attached. For example, the “twist-off” scheme does not distinguish between these two nucleotide states at all (Kikkawa et al.  2001 ). The presence of such issues, within the switch II helix scheme, leaves open the possibility that a different mechanism entirely may underlie the motility properties of some or all kinesin motors (Hirose et al.  2006 ). Here it should be emphasized that at least three different nucleotide states of kinesin have been identified, each having quite distinct functional properties (Fig.  1b–d ). Kinesin begins its motility cycle in the ADP-bound state where the motor can only weakly attach to the microtubule, and docking of the neck linker is disfavored; following ADP release, nucleotide-free kinesin attaches tightly to the microtubule, but the neck linker remains undocked; finally, ATP binds and triggers docking of the neck linker (Rice et al.  1999 ; Asenjo et al.  2006 ), while the motor remains tightly attached to the microtubule. Subsequent hydrolysis and phosphate release events reset the cycle to the ADP state. To date, atomic-level structural schemes for kinesin, including the “seesaw” mechanism described below, have largely focused on conformational changes triggered by the presence or absence of the γ-phosphate moiety of ATP. In this simplified, γ-phosphate-oriented framework, ADP-bound and no-nucleotide states would both be loosely categorized as “ADP-like” structural states, while binding of ATP or related transition-state analogs would generate an “ATP-like” structural state (Vale and Milligan  2000 ). Importantly, the key step of ADP release is not addressed within the γ-phosphate-oriented framework (see the later sections of this review dealing with this issue). On the other hand, as I now discuss, this framework has proven particularly useful in analyzing the mechanics of docking by the neck linker. Seesaw model can account for microtubule activation of the motor’s ATP sensing functions To determine how microtubules activate kinesin’s nucleotide-sensing functions, including ATP hydrolysis and ATP-triggered neck linker docking, the conformation of microtubule-attached kinesin (as reported by sub-nanometer cryo-EM reconstructions) must be compared to various atomic-resolution crystal structures. Such comparisons suggested that microtubule attachment functionally activates kinesin through a direct contact involving the absolutely conserved N255 residue within the switch II helix, which apparently mediates the formation of several additional coils at the helix’s N terminus from a region of the protein sequence often manifesting in crystal structures as a disordered loop (L11) (Sindelar and Downing  2007 ). These additional coils, universally seen in sub-nanometer cryo-EM reconstructions of kinesin-1, are the key element in an elegant "seesaw" mechanism that is proposed to explain why microtubules are required in order for ATP-bound kinesin to proceed with neck linker docking and associated catalysis of the hydrolytic step (Sindelar and Downing  2010 ). Seesaw mechanism explains how microtubule attachment can regulate hydrolytic cleavage and neck linker docking A rather specific molecular mechanism for ATP-induced docking by the neck linker could be derived from the kinesin-1 data, owing to exceptionally high clarity of features in the sub-nanometer cryo-EM maps. This clarity, which indicated that sufficient data had been collected to largely eliminate structural noise up to ∼8–9 Å resolution, permitted the synthesis of high-precision atomic models for many of the key elements visualized in the maps, using a library of crystallized subdomain conformations from various crystal structures (Sindelar and Downing  2010 ). The resulting analysis showed that kinesin’s central β-sheet pivots relative to the switch II helix around a "fulcrum" of highly conserved, bulky hydrophobic residues positioned roughly at the center of the sheet–helix interface. This movement leads to coupling between the nucleotide binding site and the neck linker because tilting the resulting "seesaw" towards one side or the other will open a hydrophobic cavity between the sheet and the helix on the opposite side (Fig.  2a ). Thus, by selectively occupying or reshaping these cavities, events at the nucleotide cleft may exert a strong energetic influence on the neck linker and vice versa. Detached from microtubules, however, the left end of the switch II helix shows strong evidence of disorder, as reflected in numerous crystal structures where density for this element is absent or displays a large "kink" in the helix (Vinogradova et al.  2008 ). The resulting absence of specific interactions between the core domain and the switch II helix, on the left side of the seesaw, indicates that under detached conditions the balance between docked and undocked states may be specified principally by elements located on the right side of the seesaw. The resulting absence of structural regulation deriving from the nucleotide binding site would account for kinesin’s apparent nucleotide-independent equilibrium between docked and non-docked neck linker conformations, when detached from the microtubule (Sindelar et al.  2002 ), as depicted in Fig.  2b . Once kinesin attaches to the microtubule, however, cryo-EM data indicate that a microtubule contact stabilizes the formation of several coils on the N terminus of the switch II helix (the "switch II helix extension"), as indicated in Fig.  2c  (Sindelar and Downing  2007 ; Kikkawa  2008 ; Bodey et al.  2009 ; Sindelar and Downing  2010 ). Stabilization of the helix extension thereby introduces a hydrophobic interface between kinesin’s central β-sheet and the switch II helix on the nucleotide-binding side of the seesaw (left side of molecule as depicted in Fig.  2 ). The upper side of this interface, contributed by kinesin’s central β-sheet, is formed by the switch I and switch II nucleotide sensing loops. The lower side of the interface is formed by the extremely conserved I254 side chain from the switch II helix extension (note that the switch II sensor loop is connected to the switch II helix by L11, a flexible loop whose length and sequence is not highly conserved). Crystal structures of myosin and kinesin, which share a very similar switch loop architecture, indicate that binding of ATP analogs in the active site stabilizes a "closed" conformation where the switch I and II sensor loops retract toward the nucleotide to directly interact with the γ-phosphate via an extensive network of hydrogen bonds (Fisher et al.  1995 ; Minehardt et al.  2001 ; Parke et al.  2010 ). In atomic models of kinesin-1 derived from cryo-EM data, ATP-induced retraction of the switch loops opens up an enlarged cavity below the nucleotide cleft and facing the switch II helix, complementary to I254 (Sindelar and Downing  2010 ) (Fig.  2d , right hand side); this cavity has been termed the "switch pocket". Thus, the seesaw can respond to ATP binding by tilting leftwards such that I254 occupies the switch pocket; this tilting movement is confirmed by high-precision docking alignments of kinesin’s central β-sheet domain into 8-Å resolution EM maps (Sindelar and Downing  2010 ) and also by a crystal structure of the Eg5 motor complexed with the ATP analog AMPPNP (Parke et al.  2010 ). In this way, ATP binding can control the seesaw angle by modulating the shape of the switch pocket. On the opposite side of the motor from the nucleotide cleft (right-hand side in Fig.  2 ), ATP-triggered leftward tilting by the seesaw opens up a second hydrophobic pocket (this may be thought of as a "docking pocket") into which the neck linker can bind (Fig.  2a and b , right-hand side). An important observation from the kinesin-1 cryo-EM structures was that the C terminus of helix 6 (to which the neck linker attaches) also contributes to the docking interaction (Sindelar and Downing  2010 ), as has been observed in crystal structure comparisons of "ADP-like" and "ATP-like" kinesin conformations (Khalil et al.  2008 ). As shown in Fig.  3 , the cryo-EM maps indicate that α6 lengthens by at least one turn during the docking transition, which would insert a conserved hydrophobic element from α6 (A321 in human conventional kinesin-1) into the docking pocket, as seen in crystal structures that exhibit a docked neck linker. The neck linker itself also contributes a highly conserved hydrophobic side chain (I325 in human kinesin-1 construct) into the docking pocket in the ATP-bound motor state. The resulting hydrophobic interactions are likely to contribute a sizable component of free energy stabilizing the docked motor conformation, owing to the substantial depth, size, and conserved hydrophobic nature of the docking pocket. The docked neck linker conformation is stabilized by additional interactions with kinesin’s N-terminal "cover strand" (Khalil et al.  2008 ), although cover-strand interactions do not appear to be directly modulated by the switch II helix. The overall view of kinesin’s microtubule-attached docking transition that emerges is that tight coupling between ATP binding and neck linker docking occurs through seesaw-mediated changes in the hydrophobic pockets present on either side of the motor domain. As described above, however, when kinesin is detached from the microtubule the left-hand side of the seesaw would no longer be regulated by bound nucleotide, accounting for the observed nonproductive behavior of the motor in the absence of microtubules.

 Discrepancies with earlier crystal structure-based models It should be noted that the structural states found in the seesaw model of kinesin’s power stroke differ substantially from those found in the recently published scheme of Nitta et al. ( 2008 ) and Hirokawa et al. ( 2009 ). For example, the Nitta et al. scheme predicts that kinesin’s no-nucleotide state (which they label as an “ATP/ADP exchange state”) exhibits most of the features (including a docked neck linker) that the seesaw scheme presented here would attribute exclusively to the ATP state, for the microtubule-attached motor. Because the Nitta et al. scheme thus requires the switch II helix to assume an “ATP-like” orientation in the  absence  of ATP, however, this scheme appears to be fundamentally incompatible with the seesaw mechanism as presented here. Another striking difference between the two schemes is the absence of an ordered switch II helix extension in many points in the ATPase cycle proposed by Nitta et al., whereas the seesaw mechanism predicts that the switch II helix extension is universally present, for the microtubule-attached case. A probable explanation for these discrepancies is that the Nitta et al. structural models are derived exclusively from crystal structures of kinesin in the absence of microtubules. The scheme presented by Nitta et al. may therefore be more relevant to kinesin’s basal ATPase reaction, although it is also possible to interpret the conformations assigned by Nitta et al. to specific nucleotide states as fluctuations that are accessible to many or all nucleotide states, owing to the large variations in the orientation of the switch II helix that are possible when ADP- or ATP analog-bound kinesin is detached from microtubules (Sindelar et al.  2002 ). Structures representing kinesin’s microtubule-attached, ATP analog-bound state inform the free energy of hydrolysis The isotopic measurements of Hackney ( 2005 ) demonstrated that, on microtubules, the hydrolysis reaction in kinesin displays some degree of reversibility. These measurements allowed an upper limit of ∼20 kJ/mol to be placed on the free energy liberated during the microtubule-attached motor’s ATP cleavage step, compared with ∼55 kJ/mol net available free energy at physiological concentrations of ADP, ATP, and phosphate. The conclusion from this work was that kinesin redistributes the majority of the available hydrolysis free energy away from the cleavage step, such that &gt;30 kJ/mol of favorable energy accompanies ATP binding during productive motor stepping. This observation was significant because it suggested that a large amount of free energy would be available to drive ATP-triggered docking by the neck linker. Docking of the neck linker, in turn, may serve a crucial role in the motility mechanism by either its “power-stroke” like character, its role in “gating”, or both (see below). Consideration of the ATP state structures available for kinesin on the microtubule (Sindelar and Downing  2010 ) may boost this free energy estimate still further. As pointed out by Hackney, his analysis of isotope exchange experiments operates under the assumption that the catalytic water is in free exchange with the solvent medium. The experimental logic used is that the more times a reversal occurs in the nucleotide site, the more labeled oxygen is introduced in the phosphate product when it is finally released and subsequently analyzed. However, the tightly sealed nature of the nucleotide cleft in the presumed catalytically active kinesin ATP structure (Parke et al.  2010 ; Sindelar and Downing  2010 ) indicates that catalytic water might not be in free exchange with the solvent medium. If this were the case, then the isotope experiments may have substantially underestimated the amount of reversal that takes place because only two labeled waters are found within the nucleotide-binding cavity where they would be available for exchange. Geometry constraints within the closed nucleotide cleft could still further limit the exchange reaction if the two waters cannot readily swap positions during the catalytic process. In such a circumstance, the maximum observed isotope exchange could be limited to two or even fewer out of four available phosphate oxygen groups, even if many rounds of repeated hydrolysis and synthesis occurred. Any opening of the nucleotide cleft that was sufficient to admit new labeled waters during catalysis would seem just as likely to release phosphate as to admit additional waters, further limiting the possibility of productive solvent exchange. It therefore seems possible that Hackney’s observation of a relatively limited isotope effect may in fact reflect a much larger rate of hydrolysis reversal than he obtained under assumptions of free solvent exchange. If so, then the free energy available from kinesin’s ATP binding step could represent an even larger fraction of the available hydrolysis energy, further strengthening his conclusion. The seesaw mechanism provides an ideal means of harnessing the free energy of ATP binding and transmitting this energy (in a microtubule-dependent manner) across the motor domain to the neck linker. In this context, however, it should be noted that even in the absence of ATP analogs, EPR measurements have detected evidence of substantial neck linker docking for kinesin’s microtubule-attached state (Rice et al.  2003 ; Larson et al.  2010 ). This latter observation led to the suggestion that ATP binding contributes &lt;1 kcal/mol of free energy towards the docking transition. While it has been argued that kinesin could in principle generate productive motility even with such poor coupling (Rice et al.  2003 ; Schnitzer et al.  2000 ), this small free energy magnitude seems inconsistent with the tight coupling indicated by the seesaw mechanism. An alternative interpretation of the EPR results is possible, however, that would support strong ATP/neck linker coupling: that the docking reported in kinesin’s non-ATP states reflects an alternative, ordered conformation of the neck linker, perhaps oriented towards the microtubule minus end. This latter interpretation is supported by cryo-EM experiments that indicate partial ordering of the neck linker in ADP-bound and no-nucleotide states, but having a distinctly different orientation than ATP analog docked state (Rice et al.  1999 ). The dual questions of (1) how much free energy drives neck linker docking and (2) how different ways the neck linker can dock are clearly central to the motility mechanism and deserve future attention. Revised forward ATP gating mechanism for processive dimer: "seesaw gating" vs. "pure strain gating" For two heads of a kinesin dimer to avoid premature detachment during processive movement along a microtubule, it is necessary for the heads to keep their ATPase cycles out of phase. One particularly counterproductive sequence of events that should be avoided follows attachment of the leading head and accompanying release of ADP from this head (relatively fast steps in the kinesin cycle). At this point in the cycle, the trailing head remains tightly attached for ∼1/50 s until coupled phosphate release and microtubule detachment occur (this latter event is the primary rate-limiting step in the cycle of microtubule-attached kinesin; Ma and Taylor  1995 ). During this 1/50 s period, it would be detrimental to motility for ATP to bind the leading head and so trigger a power stroke because the resulting strain might lead to detachment of the leading head rather than the trailing head (Rosenfeld et al.  2003 ). Indeed, kinetics (Rosenfeld et al.  2003 ) and optical trapping experiments (Guydosh and Block  2006 ) have indicated that a form of "gating" occurs in kinesin, such that when the trailing kinesin head is strongly attached, ATP is prevented from binding to the leading head. A series of elegant mutagenesis experiments, where the neck linkers of kinesin dimers were artificially lengthened (Hackney et al.  2003 ; Shastry and Hancock  2010 ) and/or an assisting load was applied (Yildiz et al.  2008 ), have implicated strain between the two kinesin heads (transmitted through the neck linkers) as a likely factor in such this type of ATP gating. However, the detailed molecular mechanism for this process remains uncertain. The seesaw scheme can account for such an "ATP gating" mechanism as follows (Fig.  4a ). Strain generated by a strongly attached trailing head would prevent forward extension of the neck linker and accompanying occupation of the docking pocket by kinesin’s α6/neck linker assembly. Consequently, if the seesaw within the leading head were to assume the ATP-bound conformation having an open docking pocket, no compensating hydrophobic interactions could be made by the α6/neck linker assembly in this head. On the other hand, if the seesaw within leading head maintains a closed docking pocket, formation of the switch pocket on the opposite side of the seesaw (required for the switch loops to assume a strong hydrogen bond network with the γ-phosphate of ATP) will not be favored owing to displacement of I254 (located on the switch II helix extension) away from the seesaw interface. In this latter circumstance, switch pocket formation would create an unfavorable hydrophobic cavity on the left-hand side of the seesaw. Thus, if the lead head is under rearwards strain but simultaneously is bound to ATP, both leftwards as well as rightwards seesaw orientations in this head are disfavored by unoccupied hydrophobic cavities so that ATP binding itself would be disfavored. This mechanism thus provides a means by which the trailing head can gate ATP binding in the lead head.
 Fig. 4 Model for gating of ATP binding in the leading head, controlled by attachment of the trailing head.  a  Cartoon schematic indicating how the trailing head in a processively moving kinesin dimer generates rearwards strain on the neck linker that would “gate” ATP binding in the lead head. Rearwards strain prevents the neck linker/α6 assembly from binding into the hydrophobic docking pocket, thus leading to unfavorable energy if the seesaw tilts leftward to accommodate ATP binding ( grayed out bottom panel ). On the other hand, if the seesaw does not tilt in response to ATP binding, the switch loops cannot deform to interact with γ-phosphate without generating the switch pocket, which will be vacant ( grayed out top panel ).  b  Depiction of structure models showing the absence of support for a “twist-off” mechanism of gating between trailing and lead motor domains. Tilting caused by ATP binding in the forward head generates almost no displacement by the neck linker attachment point. Crystal structures were fitted into a composite density map, where the density for the trailing head is from an 8-Å resolution map of the ADP•Al•Fx state of kinesin-1 and density for the leading head is from the corresponding no-nucleotide map (Sindelar and Downing  2010 ). Axis of rotation identified for core domain movement during the transition from no-nucleotide to ADP•Al•Fx motor states is indicated by the  green rod .  c  Comparison of predicted location of I325 at the α6/neck linker junction, before and after occupation of the docking pocket in the leading head by this residue accompanying neck linker docking. The resulting 5-Å displacement is consistent with a gating mechanism whereby rearwards strain prevents I325 from occupying the docking pocket 
 A number of distinct but related structural schemes have been proposed to account for this ATP gating function in kinesin. One mode of gating, which I will refer to as “pure strain gating”, would prohibit tilting in the leading head simply via geometric strain originating from the attached trailing head (Sablin and Fletterick  2004 ; Kikkawa  2008 ), similar to how a stay rope prevents the mast of a sailing ship from toppling over. This scheme contrasts with the above seesaw gating scheme where strain disfavors tilting of the lead head more indirectly, by preventing the neck linker of the leading head from occupying its docking pocket. As shown in Fig.  4b , however, ATP analog-induced tilting observed in the kinesin-1 system does not significantly increase the predicted strain between leading and trailing heads (∂ x  &lt; 0.2 Å), thus indicating that this simple type of pure strain gating would not be effective. A variation of pure strain gating has also been proposed whereby ATP-induced tilting might enhance inter-head strain by introducing steric interference between the rearwards-directed neck linker (in the leading head) and a small "β-domain" protruding from the minus end side of the motor domain (Sablin and Fletterick  2004 ; Kikkawa  2008 ). However, the tilting movement found in the kinesin-1 EM data fails to generate obvious interference between the neck linker and the β-domain (Fig.  4b ). The “pure strain gating” models were originally based on data from lower-resolution EM maps of KIF1A (∼16–20 Å) where secondary structure of the motor was not resolved, thus giving rise to substantially greater uncertainty in quantification of motor domain movement (Kikkawa et al.  2001 ). Indeed, subsequent reprocessing of same KIF1A data to ∼10–12 Å resolution (Kikkawa and Hirokawa  2006 ) led to a substantial revision in the predicted axis of rotation; the result, for ATP analog-triggered tilting, was very similar to what was seen in high-resolution kinesin-1 reconstructions (Sindelar and Downing  2010 ). Thus, the analysis presented in Fig.  4  tends to disfavor “pure strain gating” type models for KIF1A as well as kinesin-1. The role of ADP is critical to motor function The functional role of ADP in kinesin’s cycle may be equally critical to the motor mechanism as ATP. Numerous studies on a wide range of motile kinesin families have shown that the ternary complex of microtubule-attached, ADP-bound kinesin is relatively weak, with dissociation constants of 10–20 μM. In comparison, kinesin’s microtubule attachment affinity is 1 μM or lower in other observed nucleotide states (Rosenfeld et al.  1996 ; Ma and Taylor  1997 ). This instability in the ADP state is critically involved in defining both the start and finish of the hydrolysis cycle of the microtubule-attached motor, as was highlighted by the landmark observation that a dimer of ADP•kinesin heads releases only one ADP when it encounters microtubule (Hackney  1994 ). Remarkably, the dissociation pathway of the three-way ADP•kinesin•microtubule complex has been shown to depend on external strain, such that motor detachment is more likely when an external load is applied to the neck linker from the leading direction, while ADP release is more likely when the load is applied from the trailing direction (Uemura et al.  2002 ; Uemura and Ishiwata  2003 ). These characteristics are consistent with the following ADP-gating scheme for processive movement by kinesin dimers (Hancock and Howard  1999 ). At the stage in the cycle where one head is ATP-bound and a second, ADP-bound head is searching for the next binding site, a productive forward attachment step by the ADP head would likely involve considerable rearward-directed strain on this head’s neck linker, while the reverse is true for a backward attachment step. Kinesin’s asymmetric behavior under strain with respect to ADP, therefore, naturally favors the forward step (see the final section for an illustration of this mechanism). The role of ADP, particularly with respect to gating, is thus critical to understanding kinesin’s motility mechanism. Seesaw leads to a picture of how phosphate release can trigger kinesin detachment under forward strain The seesaw model accounts for load-dependent release of the microtubule-attached kinesin•ADP motor domain in the following way (Fig.  5 ). In the absence of ATP, the switch pocket collapses and prevents the seesaw from tilting leftward without introducing severe steric overlap between the switch loops and I254 from the switch II helix extension (Fig.  5a ). Forward strain on the neck linker, however, favors its docked conformation, which in turn requires leftward tilting of the seesaw. The only way to accommodate the resulting steric overlap between I254 and the switch loops is for the helix extension to revert to its loop structure (seen in crystal structures), which would abolish the interaction seen between residue N255 in the extension and the microtubule surface (Sindelar and Downing  2007 ), thus destabilizing the kinesin–microtubule interaction. Thus, under forward strain the seesaw model suggests a pathway for microtubule detachment of kinesin•ADP that involves melting of the switch II helix extension, thus accounting for a critical regulatory step in kinesin’s ADP-gated behavior (Fig.  5b ).
 Fig. 5 Cartoon schematic indicating how forward strain on the neck linker could interact with the seesaw to promote detachment in the absence of ATP. The forward strain would favor docking of the neck linker into the docking pocket, thus promoting leftward tilting of the seesaw. However, if ATP is not bound, collapse of the switch pocket would lead to steric interference with I254 in the switch II helix extension in the leftward-tilted case. This action therefore promotes melting of the extension and accompanying weakening of the kinesin–microtubule interaction 
 The functional relevance of this proposed detachment pathway is best understood in the context of a functioning kinesin dimer (see below for a schematic of the dimer cycle). Kinetic measurements have indicated that, for kinesin dimers, phosphate release in the trailing head is timed within measurement error of microtubule detachment by this head (Rosenfeld et al.  2003 ). Experiments have suggested that phosphate release may precede detachment by the trailing head (Klumpp et al.  2004 ), but definitive proof for this order of events is lacking, thus raising the question of whether kinesin detaches as kinesin•ADP•Pi or as kinesin•ADP, and what the structural basis for this decision might be. Consideration of the seesaw model, in conjunction with the available crystal structure model of kinesin’s microtubule-attached ATP state as modeled by AMPPNP (Parke et al.  2010 ), leads to the following pathway for kinesin detachment related to phosphate release. Following catalytic cleavage of the β–γ phosphate bond but before phosphate release, the predicted geometry of the cleaved γ-phosphate group appears poised to maintain a large part of the extensive hydrogen bond network that holds the switch loops "closed" (results not shown). This geometry, together with observation of hydrolysis reversal in microtubule-attached kinesin•ADP•Pi (Hackney  2005 ), indicates that kinesin may maintain its closed switch loop conformation for a substantial interval following ATP cleavage, thus remaining in an "ATP-like" conformation. Kinesin should accordingly remain tightly attached to the microtubule during this period since expected conformational changes would be localized to the nucleotide cleft until phosphate escapes (perhaps due to opening of the switch I "lid" following protonation of the conserved switch I–switch II salt bridge between R203 and E236; Parke et al.  2010 ). Release of phosphate, however, would permit the switch loops to relax into their ADP conformation, leading to collapse of the switch pocket and subsequent motor detachment under forward strain as outlined above. This line of reasoning (motivated by the seesaw model) would suggest that phosphate release precedes detachment of the motor domain, at least for the trailing head in a processive dimer. The more general case of ADP-stimulated microtubule detachment remains mysterious While the seesaw model could thus explain ADP’s destabilizing role in gating by forward strain, the more general phenomenon of instability in the ADP–kinesin–microtubule complex is not so easily accounted for. One explanation for ADP-induced motor detachment involves a "twist-off" scheme (Kikkawa et al.  2001 ), mentioned above. In the twist-off scheme, ATP-like orientations of the switch II helix on the motor core are hypothesized to protrude from kinesin’s microtubule binding face to form a complementary binding surface for the microtubule (leading to tight attachment), while "ADP-like" orientations of the helix would abolish the complementarity and lead to microtubule detachment. This scheme, however, is inconsistent with high-resolution cryo-EM observations of the no-nucleotide state of kinesin-1, which tightly attaches to the microtubule but was discovered in the EM study to exhibit an "ADP-like" switch II helix orientation (Sindelar and Downing  2007 ). In order to reconcile this model with the ADP-like no-nucleotide conformation observed in the kinesin-1 EM study, (Nitta et al.  2008 ) suggested that the EM study reflected an early, presumably weakly attached intermediate of kinesin during the ADP release process (that is, before ADP is actually released). Contrary to this proposal, however, EM comparisons of ADP-bound and no-nucleotide states of kinesin-1 indicated that density corresponding to bound ADP was specifically absent from the nucleotide cleft under the no-nucleotide experimental conditions, while ADP density was significantly present in the ADP state (Sindelar and Downing  2010 ). The cryo-EM maps of (Sindelar and Downing  2010 ) have since been refined from ∼9-Å to ∼8-Å resolution (C.V.S., unpublished data), and the corresponding increase in map quality further supports the interpretation that the nucleotide cleft is fully vacated under these experimental conditions (Fig.  6 ). Both no-nucleotide as well as ADP-bound motor states, as visualized in these EM maps, exhibit "ADP-like" orientations of the switch II helix. These observations indicate that "ADP-like" orientations of the switch II helix can occur in both tightly microtubule-attached (no-nucleotide) as well as weakly attached (ADP-bound) states of the motor. The conformation of the switch II helix itself also appears largely the same in these two maps; the density indicates that the helix maintains structure in its N-terminal "extension" coils (Sindelar and Downing  2010 ). Cryo-EM results with conventional kinesin are thus quite difficult to reconcile with any version of the ADP "twist-off" scheme. An alternative scheme, suggested by Minehardt et al. ( 2001 ), might be that microtubule attachment affects the switch I loop through a pathway involving the microtubule-binding loop L8, which connects to the switch I loop via the helix α3. A mutation in L8 is found to stall kinesin in a tightly attached ADP state following hydrolysis, which could lend support to this suggestion (Klumpp et al.  2003 ).

ADP is rendered as a ball-and-stick diagram 
 The related mystery of microtubule-stimulated ADP release An alternative to studying ADP-stimulated kinesin detachment from the microtubule is to investigate the mechanism of microtubule-stimulated ADP release since these processes are closely linked by thermodynamics. One proposal is that microtubule-triggered "opening" of kinesin’s nucleotide cleft would stimulate ADP release (Hirose et al.  2006 ; Kikkawa and Hirokawa  2006 ), although this is in some respects puzzling due to the fact that most known crystal structures of kinesin exhibit an "open" nucleotide cleft but nonetheless have extremely high affinity for ADP (Kull et al.  1996 ). Indeed, sub-nanometer cryo-EM reconstructions of the kinesin•microtubule complex before and after ADP release suggest a process rather different from "opening" (Sindelar and Downing  2007 ,  2010 ). As shown in Fig.  6 , the switch I loop in the cryo-EM reconstruction of kinesin-1’s ADP state is remote from the nucleotide density and does not appear to be completely ordered (thus the cleft would be considered "open"). In contrast, the no-nucleotide state exhibits density corresponding to the switch I loop intruding into the nucleotide cleft, accompanied by the apparent loss of density corresponding to the nucleotide-coordinating P-loop. The significance of these observations was highlighted by the ability to resolve well-defined density for the P-loop and switch I in all other sub-nanometer maps characterized for kinesin-1. Coordinated displacement of the P-loop by switch I during ADP release, as implied by these observations, is consistent with an "ejection" role for the switch I loop in which conformational changes induced by microtubule attachment propagate to this loop and lead to dissociation of ADP (Sindelar and Downing  2007 ). The role of microtubules remains quite unclear, however, for this putative "ejection" scheme. Microtubule attachment reduces the ADP affinity of free kinesin by approximately three orders of magnitude, from the low nanomolar range to 10–20 μM (Hackney  1988 ). It is therefore surprising that the position and shape of kinesin’s secondary structure elements appear largely unchanged following ADP release in maps of the microtubule–kinesin-1 complex (Sindelar and Downing  2010 ). Moreover, the orientation of the core domain relative to the switch II helix remains unchanged within the ability to discriminate in these maps. Indeed, the above described changes in switch I and the P-loop are essentially the only reliably resolved differences between ADP and no-nucleotide states in the kinesin-1 cryo-EM maps, despite the 8-Å resolution now uniformly achieved for all nucleotide states in this construct. Moreover, the overall motor architecture seen in these kinesin-1 maps appears very similar to crystallized conformations such as that seen in the KIF1A•ADP complex, where ADP is bound very tightly (Kikkawa et al.  2001 ). Thus, comparison of kinesin-1 EM maps to each other or to ADP-bound kinesin crystal structures does not yield an obvious explanation for the observed instability of the kinesin•ADP•microtubule complex. It may be concluded that, whatever the mechanism by which the kinesin•ADP•microtubule complex is destabilized, the process must involve relatively subtle conformational rearrangements that are not evident in EM maps having resolutions in the 8 Å range. It should be noted that at least two cryo-EM studies of other kinesin family members have concluded that other types of structural changes not seen in the kinesin-1 studies may occur in the no-nucleotide microtubule co-complex (Hirose et al.  2006 ; Peters et al.  2010 ). However, these other studies reported resolutions no higher than 10 Å, such that secondary structure elements were not always unambiguously resolved. It is therefore of considerable interest to obtain higher-resolution cryo-EM maps describing microtubule complexes of other kinesin variants in order to further test and elaborate on the various proposed schemes pertaining to the role of ADP. A working model of dimeric kinesin based on the seesaw Elements in the preceding discussion may be assembled into a working model describing processive movement by a kinesin dimer, as shown in Fig.  7  which highlights a series of key structural intermediates that may occur in the cycle. In state 1, the trailing head contains bound ATP and/or ADP•Pi within the tightly closed nucleotide-binding cavity of kinesin’s actively hydrolyzing conformation. Neck linker docking in the trailing head biases the partner head to search toward the leading position, where it can attach to the microtubule in an ADP-bound state. In state 2, attachment of the lead head, in concert with rearwards strain on its neck linker, promotes subtle rearrangements in the motor domain (possibly involving L8) that in turn promote the "nucleotide-ejecting" conformation of the switch I loop, causing loss of ADP in this head. Subsequent ATP binding in the lead head, in state 2, is inhibited by rearward strain on the lead head’s neck linker, according to the gating scheme described in Fig.  4 . In state 3, catalytic cleavage and phosphate release in the trailing head lead to collapse of the switch pocket, but forward strain on the neck linker of this head prevents compensatory seesaw tilting to relieve the resulting steric overlap between the switch pocket and the I254 from the switch II helix extension. Thus, in state 3, collapse of the switch pocket forces melting of the switch II helix extension, leading to detachment of the trailing head from the microtubule. Subsequently, ATP binding in the leading head resets the system to state 1, but with the kinesin dimer displaced 8 nm towards the microtubule plus end and identity of the leading and trailing heads swapped.

 The largest differences between the scheme presented here and earlier proposals for kinesin dimer operation relate to integration of the "seesaw" mechanism. The seesaw mechanism serves a key function in the current dimer scheme by generating coupling between the formation of two distinct hydrophobic pockets on either side of kinesin, the switch pocket and the docking pocket. The switch pocket and the docking pocket, in turn, both exhibit obvious and direct energetic coupling to key motor control elements (ATP and the neck linker, respectively). These features appear to form a tightly coupled structural pathway that would be well suited to drive important ADP and ATP gating functions as described here, in addition to the "power stroke" function previously linked to the seesaw (Sindelar and Downing  2010 ). Incidentally, strain-gating via the neck linkers as described here and elsewhere would be relevant not only to dimer function, but more generally to any system involving multiple kinesins working to cooperatively generate transport, so long as the individual kinesin heads were connected by a sufficiently rigid linkage—for example, two kinesin heads connected via a DNA spacer (Miyazono et al.  2010 ), or even a glass surface coated with monomeric head domains as found in microtubule gliding assays (Vale et al.  1985 ). "Power stroke" or "ratchet"? A long-standing question of interest has been whether ATP-triggered docking of kinesin’s neck linker is favorable enough to constitute a "power stroke" that would drive the cargo forward via what is essentially an elastic deformation. It is commonly pointed out, for example, that thermal energy is likely to drive large fluctuations of the unbound head in an actively moving kinesin dimer, due in part to the relatively weak observed stability of the docked neck linker conformation even in the presence of ATP (Rice et al.  2003 ). In addition, docking of the neck linker by itself would not even generate half of the 8 nm displacement that must be contributed by each catalytic domain during a complete turnover (Rice et al.  1999 ). Thus, a "power stroke" by the neck linker is clearly not adequate by itself to account for the prominent 8-nm steps that are the hallmark of kinesin motility. Contrasting to such a "power stroke" scheme of kinesin motility are “thermal ratchet” type schemes in which the stepping process would driven solely by strain-gating that prevents the freely diffusing head from taking a step in the wrong direction. Such "ratchet" models have been explored theoretically and are proposed to account for kinesin’s stepping behavior, although it remains unclear whether discrepancies between these models and experimental observations can be fully rationalized (Fox and Choi  2001 ). It has also been noted that characteristics of “power stroke” and “ratchet” models are not entirely distinct (Block  2007 ). While a detailed discussion of this topic is beyond the scope of the current review, it is interesting to note that in the seesaw model presented here, the neck linker could be viewed as having dual roles. The strain-gating function of the neck linker, as has been described above, arises from the way that externally imposed forces would promote or hinder binding of the neck linker into the docking pocket. This strain modulation in turn would affect the affinity of various elements (nucleotide/motor/microtubule) for each other at appropriate points in the cycle. At the same time, the free energy of neck linker docking remains strongly coupled, in the seesaw model, to the free energy of ATP binding. While ATP-driven neck linker docking would clearly be subject to large thermal fluctuations, the docking interactions nevertheless seem likely to kinetically accelerate forward movement by the diffusing head, at the same time slowing backward movement. Such a kinetic effect could be seen as a type of “power stroke”. It remains a challenge for the future to quantify the role of strain-gating and power strokes in the kinesin system and other motors, using increasingly detailed physical models. Summary The seesaw model provides a lens through which to interpret kinesin’s control pathway that links the nucleotide binding site to the neck linker, and how this pathway relates to gating of partner heads, in terms of fundamental biophysical forces including steric, hydrophobic, and hydrogen bond interactions. While many aspects of the scheme presented here remain speculative, the scheme nevertheless provides a framework for further scrutiny of kinesin’s various experimentally determined features. In contrast to kinesin, the other cytoskeletal motors dynein and myosin currently lack high-resolution structural descriptions of the motor–filament complexes: the best reported resolution for a 3D cryo-EM map of actomyosin is 14 Å (Holmes et al.  2003 ), while dynein–microtubule reconstructions are currently limited to &gt;20 Å even in the best case (Mizuno et al.  2007 ). Considering what is now known about microtubule-induced rearrangements in kinesin, it seems probable that continued study of these other cytoskeletal motors will harbor future surprises. This review has focused on the mechanism of conventional kinesin I, the founding member of this motor family. Other variants of kinesin exist with strikingly different functional features, including reversed directionality as well as microtubule depolymerization. The seesaw mechanism likely to plays a key role in most or all of these other systems as well, owing to the extremely high degree of sequence and/or structure conservation in the amino acid sequences defining all of the seesaw elements listed in Table  1  (see  http://www.cellbio.duke.edu/kinesin/ ). While the near-universal sequence conservation in the switch sensor loops across all kinesin families has long been noted, the conserved nature of other important seesaw elements (including I254/N255 in the switch II helix extension as well as the fulcrum residues) has received less attention. It is particularly striking that, despite the absence of a conventionally defined “neck linker” in minus-end and depolymerizing kinesin motors, these other motors maintain sequence conservation in the docking pocket as well as the complementary hydrophobic insertion elements seen at positions 322, 325 in kinesin’s neck linker. “ATP-like” conformations of two minus-end motors have been reported, and both exhibit docked conformations of a “neck mimic” element analogous to the neck linker (Vinogradova et al.  2004 ; Heuston et al.  2010 ). While an analogous “ATP-like” crystallized conformation from the depolymerizing kinesin family has not yet been seen, it is quite tempting to predict that a docked neck mimic will be found there as well. More broadly, it may be postulated that the entire seesaw assembly described here, including the neck linker/neck mimic, acts as the fundamental “engine” onto which additional modular components may be attached to yield different functional results. On a final note, it must be said that even in the kinesin variants most similar to conventional kinesin I, important functional differences have been observed. For example, the Eg5 member of the kinesin-5 family was found to exhibit strikingly different nucleotide dependence of neck linker docking compared with kinesin-1, and even appears to dock the neck linker prior to ATP binding (Rosenfeld et al.  2005 ; Larson et al.  2010 ). Future, higher-resolution structural studies of these and other kinesin family members are likely to add much to our understanding of these fascinating molecular machines. </Body>

    <Abstact>While light scattering has long been applied to the analysis of biomolecular interactions, recent advances have extended the practical use of light scattering techniques to cover a rather broad range of phenomena. In this paper I review essential light scattering theory as applied to specific interactions under thermodynamically ideal conditions and present examples showing how light scattering elucidates the dynamic equilibrium and kinetic behavior of proteins and other biomacromolecules.</Abstact>
    <Body>Introduction Light scattering (LS) is a versatile tool for characterizing biomacromolecules and their interactions, affording solution-based measurements of dynamic equilibrium properties and kinetic phenomena without recourse to immobilization or labeling. While both flavors of light scattering—multi-angle static light scattering (SLS or MALS) and dynamic light scattering (DLS)—are of great utility, the power of MALS, in particular for these types of studies, lies in the combination of practical and conceptual simplicity, theoretical and analytical rigor, and generality. In vitro interaction measurements comprise two essential elements: a series of solutions containing the interacting species at different concentrations or compositions, and a reporter signal which is modulated by the degree of interaction. While most techniques involve reporter signals that are only indirectly related to the interaction product (e.g., fluorescence intensity, ‘response units’, consumed enzyme, etc.), MALS reports the weight-average solution molar mass M w , which is directly connected with the essence of complex formation. To illustrate, consider the 1:1 association of an equimolar solution of two proteins, each with molar mass 50 kDa. In the absence of interaction, M w  = 50 kDa, while under stoichiometric association M w  = 100 kDa—leading to a doubling of the MALS signal. With minimal investment in sample preparation, method development, and data analysis, light scattering yields rich information, including molar mass, binding affinity, and absolute stoichiometry of complex interactions, such as simultaneous homo- and hetero-association or specific multi-valent complex formation, the magnitude of non-specific interactions, the size (radius of gyration r g  or hydrodynamic radius r h ) of these complexes, and the quantitative kinetics of binding, aggregation, dissociation or degradation. The emergence of new instrumentation for automating and facilitating these types of studies holds promise for re-invigorating and expanding the use of both MALS and DLS in biomolecular interaction research, complementing other label-free biophysical techniques. Qualitative or semi-quantitative turbidity and 90° light scattering are commonly used to monitor aggregation kinetics and equilibrium. The focus of this review will be quantitative analyses of light scattering to determine binding affinity, stoichiometry and/or detailed kinetics, and in particular recent developments resulting from automated and highly sensitive MALS and DLS instruments. Theoretical background Biomolecules are subject to various types of interactions. One important classification divides specific interactions—those that lead to the formation of well-defined complexes via site-specific binding—from non-specific interactions arising from net charge, dipoles, hydrophobic patches, van der Waals forces, etc. The thermodynamic (and, consequentially, light-scattering) treatment of specific interactions differs from that of non-specific interactions. Specific interactions are considered to produce discrete species, coexisting in dynamic equilibrium with free monomers and modeled as a composition-dependent polydisperse solution. Non-specific interactions are modeled as thermodynamic non-ideality; these are not mutually exclusive and may occur in tandem. In this section I focus on MALS; the interested reader is referred to Hanlon et al. ( 2010 ) for the composition-gradient (CG)-DLS theory of specific binding. Specific reversible association in the ideal limit Some examples of modeling static light scattering measurements for specific reversible associations were discussed by Burchard and Cowie ( 1972 ). These were generalized by Attri and Minton ( 2005a ,  b ) and are reproduced with minor notational changes below. Details of the assumptions incorporated in MALS analysis appear in Wyatt ( 1993 ) and Attri and Minton ( 2005a ). To summarize, the ‘ideal gas law’ for static light scattering from a solution comprising multiple, non-interacting species  i  (i.e., species not subject to appreciable non-specific interactions/thermodynamic non-ideality), presented in Eq.  1 , is simply a sum of terms, each of which corresponds to the scattered intensity from an individual species. 1 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

 Non-specific interactions/non-ideality Non-specific interactions in biomolecular systems are usually weak in comparison to specific interactions. Typical proteins and other compact biomacromolecules exhibit negligible non-ideality below concentrations of ∼1 g/L, although a lower concentration limit for ideal behavior applies to charged molecules in poorly screened buffers as well as those presenting diffuse or extended structures. Optimal CG-MALS measurements cover a concentration range of ∼0.1–10× K D , corresponding to an upper K D  of 10 μM (for 10-kDa molecules) or 1 μM (for 100-kDa molecules) that may be characterized entirely in the ideal limit; the majority of examples in this review fall within this range. Any analysis of specific binding above the ideal concentration limit must account for non-ideality; likewise, non-specific interactions must generally be analyzed at minimum concentrations of a few grams per liter. While CG-MALS is well-suited to the analysis of non-specific interactions and also to the analysis of specific or quasi-specific interactions in the presence of thermodynamic non-ideality, the theoretical description is beyond the scope of this review. For further details, the reader is referred to Minton ( 2007 ) and Fernández and Minton ( 2008 ,  2009 ). Quasi-equilibrium techniques Light scattering measurements are conducted in both fractionated mode and unfractionated or batch mode. Fractionation, usually accomplished by means of size exclusion chromatography (SEC) or asymmetric field-flow fractionation, has the advantage of separating out from the sample of interest any large aggregates and other particulates that are highly detrimental to light scattering signals. Wyatt ( 1993 ) reviewed the utility of SEC coupled to MALS for absolute characterization of molar mass and size distributions, independent of column calibration. This technique can assess the stoichiometry of tightly bound complexes that do not dissociate upon chromatographic dilution or column shear. For interaction assays the disadvantage of fractionation lies in the ongoing dilution and separation of molecules that must occupy the same volume in order to interact. This leads to ill-defined states in terms of kinetics or dynamic equilibrium, so that fully quantitative interaction analysis in the fractionated mode is only possible under certain carefully characterized conditions: either very rapid or very slow equilibration (on the time scale of the separation). Several authors have reported quantifying monomer–dimer interactions by SEC-MALS. Das et al. ( 2008 ) studied SecA and SecA mutants, analyzing a series of chromatography peaks injected at successive concentrations, assuming fast equilibration. Equilibrium dissociation constants (K D ) of less than 100 nM to over 10 μM were characterized. A similar analysis was performed by Kapoor et al. ( 2010 ) on nucleobindin-1; these authors also estimated stoichiometry and binding affinity of nucleobindin-1 with G-protein α subunits by injecting a series of mixtures at the appropriate molar ratios. Bajaj et al. ( 2007 ) demonstrated an integrated LS-UV cell to overcome the technical problem of inter-detector dilution, determining the K D  of β-lactoglobulin dimerization. Equilibrium techniques Ideally, interaction studies should be performed under true equilibrium, or at least well-defined kinetic states. The series of batch MALS or DLS measurements over varying compositions required to analyze affinity and stoichiometry is referred to as composition-gradient MALS (CG-MALS) or DLS (CG-DLS). Approaches to batch measurements differ in levels of automation and the type of non-equilibrium data that may be acquired on the way to equilibrium. CG-MALS and CG-DLS require minimal method development. A typical automated analysis takes 0.5–3 h (depending on equilibration rates), and usually only one or two such runs are required to reach full characterization. Apparatus Cuvette Cuvette-based measurements have been the mainstay of CG-MALS and CG-DLS for decades. Samples are prepared at the requisite concentrations or compositions, placed in scintillation vials or square microcuvettes, then measured individually by placing the cuvette into a MALS or DLS detector. Concentrations must be measured off-line or on the basis of accurate dilutions of a known stock. Scintillation vials afford full multi-angle measurements but require copious amounts of sample and, due to the poor optical quality and mechanical tolerances, introduce relatively large uncertainty. High-quality, non-disposable square microcuvettes may require only a few microliters of sample but are limited to 90° scattering and also need to be cleaned thoroughly between samples. In a recent example of cuvette-based CG-MALS, Scherer et al. ( 2010 ) examined the weak self-association of monoclonal antibodies at high concentration versus ionic strength. Due to the high viscosity of these solutions, they were prepared individually and measured in scintillation vials. Microbatch A flow cell provides a controlled and stable environment, low stray light, and superior optical quality for multi-angle measurements, making it preferable to most cuvette-based measurements. In a microbatch experiment, samples are prepared at the requisite compositions and loaded into syringes. A general-use syringe pump dispenses the contents of each syringe through a filter into the MALS/DLS detector. The in-line filter greatly improves signal-to-noise by removing dust particles and large aggregates. An additional advantage of microbatch over cuvette-based measurements is the option for adding an in-line concentration detector instead of relying on off-line measurement or dilution accuracy. Measurement over a wide range of concentrations is important to capturing the full behavior and should include conditions around the onset of association as well as those producing appreciable oligomer fractions. Woll et al. ( 2011 ) analyzed homodimerization of the ∼20-kDa neuronal calcium sensor-1 via microbatch measurements with monomer-equivalent concentrations that ranged from single-digit micromolar concentrations up to 700 μM in order to quantify K D  of 10 μM; sedimentation equilibrium (SE) analysis was within the same affinity range at K D  = 2 μM. The tetrameric form of hemoglobin (Hb) is well-known and provides the opportunity to test CG-MALS analysis of a system that exceeds the complexity of simple monomer–dimer equilibrium. Yamaguchi and Adachi ( 2002 ) employed microbatch measurements to calculate the monomer–dimer and dimer–tetramer K D ’s of Hb A, Hb F, and also single-globulin complexes comprising α-, β- or γ-globulins. The ability to readily distinguish between the solution behavior of variants suggests that CG-MALS interaction analyses, in combination with a finite number of site-specific mutations, can potentially complement atomic-level structure calculations to map out the free-energy landscape across the binding site. Automated stopped-flow Automated stopped-flow CG-MALS/DLS incorporates the advantages of a closed flow-cell-based system with automated sample preparation and delivery. A stopped-flow CG-MALS system consists of a multi-angle static light scattering detector, a composition-gradient delivery system, and an optional concentration detector (UV/Vis absorption, differential refractive index, or similar). Since each injection consists of freshly mixed aliquots, association, dissociation, or aggregation kinetics may be observed, although in many systems equilibration occurs too rapidly. Attri and Minton ( 2005a ,  b ) described an apparatus utilizing a dual-syringe pump, combining on-the-fly mixing with in-line filtration. The pump was programmed to draw on one or two protein stock solutions or buffer to produce a series of compositions which were delivered to sensitive MALS and UV/Vis absorption detectors. This work quantified sub-micromolar to millimolar K D  and the stoichiometry of small protein complexes, such as chymotrypsin (CTR) homodimers and the soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI)–CTR hetero-association. Further evolution of the system, described in Some and Kenrick ( 2012 ), has resulted in a commercial triple-syringe-pump system that extends the range of sensitivity to sub-nanomolar affinities, bundled with a complete software package for experiment design, control, data acquisition, and analysis (Calypso, Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA). Much of the work described below employed either the Attri and Minton configuration or the Calypso system and software in combination with a DAWN-HELEOS MALS detector (Wyatt Technology) and a Waters 2487 UV/Vis absorption detector (Waters Corp, Milford, MA). Practical considerations regarding detector and in-line filter configurations are discussed by Some and Kenrick ( 2012 ). Automated titration An automated in-place titration setup was reported by Fernández and Minton ( 2008 ). In this apparatus, the stock solution is placed in a cuvette directly inside the MALS detector. A dual syringe pump is programmed to produce a dilution series through successive steps of removing a volume of solution from the cuvette, adding an equal volume of buffer, then mixing by means of a magnetic stir bar. Concentrations are calculated from the known initial concentration and dilution parameters. The same apparatus includes a thermal jacket for temperature control and relatively rapid temperature jumps. Plate reader Dynamic light scattering measures diffusion constants, which may be related to an effective size—the ‘hydrodynamic radius’ r h —via the Stokes–Einstein equation; CG-DLS relates changes in solution-average r h  to complex formation although it can also be used to evaluate certain conformational changes. Plate reader-based CG-DLS is a quite attractive technique in terms of time, sample quantity, disposable optical cells (microwell plates), and temperature control to rapidly assess thermodynamic parameters such as enthalpy, entropy, and conformational transitions. While Sharma et al. ( 2008 ) employed manual batch CG-DLS to evaluate stoichiometry and K D  of the fibroblast growth factor–receptor complex, Hanlon et al. ( 2010 ) automated multiple CG-DLS experiments—with temperature ramps—by means of a DLS plate reader (Wyatt Technology). The primary disadvantage of CG-DLS is reduced rigor in data analysis: the relationship between the diffusion constants of monomers and their complexes depends greatly on the specific assembly conformation, unlike the strict molar mass relationships analyzed in CG-MALS. CG-DLS covers a smaller range of K D  compared to CG-MALS and, in a plate reader, all but the slowest kinetics are lost. Hanlon et al. ( 2010 ) performed simultaneous CG-MALS and CG-DLS measurements to enhance plate reader-based CG-DLS. Methods and expected signals Composition-gradient-MALS quantifies self-association via the concentration dependence of M w , and hetero-association via the compositional dependence of M w . When necessary, the two types of analyses may be combined in a single run, and the total data set is fit to Eqs.  3 – 5  constructed to represent all species and complexes present. Figure  1  illustrates a three-part method comprising concentration gradients of each of two proteins individually for analyzing their respective molar masses and self-interactions and a composition gradient for analyzing further hetero-association. Individual segments may be included or omitted as necessary, and other forms of composition gradients may be desirable under specific circumstances. Self-association analysis beyond that of the monomer–dimer requires a greater range of concentrations. Fig. 1 Method for analyzing simultaneous self- and hetero-interactions.

 The functional forms expected for different self-association models corresponding to the gradients of Fig.  1a, c  differ not only in the overall light scattering signal but also in the shape of the curvature, so that judicious curve fitting discriminates models that produce overall similar levels of scattered intensity, as illustrated in Fig.  2a . It should be noted that the 10 μM monomer–trimer association differs from the dimer models both in overall height, since the trimer molar mass exceeds that of the dimer, and in shape, due to different functional dependences on concentration. Fig. 2 Simulated light scattering (LS) signals for:  a  single-species concentration gradients ( solid blue line  no interaction,  dotted green line  monomer–dimer K D  = 10 μM,  dashed red line  monomer–trimer K D  = 10 μM,  dash–dot black line  monomer–dimer K D  = 1 μM),  b  crossover gradient of Fig.  1b  assuming 1:1 binding at three different affinities ( solid blue line  no interaction,  dotted green line  K D  = 100 nM,  dashed red line  K D  = 10 nM,  dash–dot black line  K D  = 1 nM),  c  crossover gradient of Fig.  1b  assuming different stoichiometries (protein X:protein Y) at constant per-site binding affinity [ solid blue line  no interaction,  dotted green line  1:1,  dashed purple line  2:1,  dash–dot red line  3:1,  long-dash-gray line  2:2 (K D  for 2:2 is 10× that of the other stoichiometries)] 
 When the molar masses of hetero-associating species do not differ by more than a factor of ∼5–10, a ‘crossover’ composition gradient as in Fig.  1b  is optimal in that the contrast between interacting and non-interacting light scattering signals is prominent and intuitive. As depicted in Fig.  2b , complex formation leads to a peak in the MALS signal at the stoichiometric composition ratio; the height of the peak increases with affinity since a larger mole fraction of complexes produces higher solution molar mass. Figure  2c  illustrates how the position and height of the peak, as well as the shape of the curve, correspond to the absolute complex stoichiometry. When the mass ratio of the interacting species exceeds 5–10:1, a titration-like gradient—holding the concentration of the larger molecule constant and increasing concentrations of the smaller molecule—is preferable to the linear crossover, preventing small uncertainties in the concentration of the larger molecule from overwhelming the change in solution M w  due to binding of a small molecule to a large one. Composition gradients may be optimized for signal contrast via simulations, such as using the Calypso software tools. Results The experiments reported below all pertain to automated CG-MALS, usually in the stopped-flow configuration. They are presented in order of increasing complexity of association models. Self-association Analysis of multiple self-association states can be quite challenging in that the same concentration dependence may be fit by more than one model, especially if the data are acquired over a limited concentration range. At such times all that may be left is to apply Occam’s razor, postulating that the simplest model that fits the empirical data is usually the correct one. Del Castillo et al. ( 2011 ) characterized the effect of nucleotides and the M-domain on self-association of ClpB, a hexameric molecular chaperon, by means of CG-SLS, SE, and other techniques. CG-SLS and SE were in good agreement that the simplest, best-fit model to this self-association is monomer–hexamer–dodecamer, and that the addition of ATP and ADP enhanced oligomerization by 5× and 8×, respectively. FtsZ, a bacterial cell division protein that self-associates to produce protofilaments in the form of chains and rings, has been the subject of several CG-MALS studies. Kameyama and Minton ( 2006 ) and Martos et al. ( 2010 ) found that FtsZ oligomerization is best fit to a quasi-isodesmic association model, meaning that the protein molecules form dimers, trimers, tetramers, etc., with a nearly constant affinity to bind new monomers to the growing chain. Exchanging EDTA for Mg 2+  in the guanosine 5′-diphosphate (GDP)-containing buffer increased the affinity by threefold. The best-fit model and equilibrium association constants were essentially identical between CG-MALS and SE. Guanosine 5′-triphosphate (GTP) induces extensive polymerization of FtsZ. Monterroso et al. ( 2012a ,  b ) employed CG-MALS, CG-DLS, sedimentation velocity, and cryo-transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to investigate filaments formed by FtsZ in the presence of GTP and a slowly-hydrolyzing GTP analog, GMPCPP, at multiple concentrations of Mg 2+ . These authors found that the distributions of mass and size correlated to a cyclic polymer with a favored configuration that depended on the specific nucleotide as well as Mg 2+  concentration; the affinities varied widely, from ∼60 μM to 1 nM. At 5 mM Mg 2+ , FtsZ formed rings with a narrow distribution of sizes, found by CG-MALS to correspond to 130 ± 20 monomers and an r g  of 100 ± 10 nm (GTP), or to 190 ± 20 monomers and an r g  of 110 ± 11 nm (GMPCPP). These dimensions correlate well to the expected size of a ring constructed out of the corresponding number of monomers. DLS diffusion constants, sedimentation coefficients, and cryo-TEM studies all supported these findings, as did the atomic force microscopy images (Mateos-Gil et al.  2012 ). As an important biotherapeutic, insulin self-association is of great practical interest. Attri et al. ( 2010a ,  b ) characterized oligomerization of insulin in the presence of and in the absence of Zn by means of CG-MALS and CG-DLS. In the absence of Zn, insulin appears to follow an isodesmic association model with a minimal K D  of 40 μM at pH 7.2; SE data at pH 7.0 yielded an essentially identical affinity. At pH 10 the best-fit model differed slightly, indicating that the initial dimer nucleation step is about fivefold weaker than the addition of subsequent monomers. In the presence of Zn and neutral pH, insulin is known to form hexamers with the hexamer association complete beyond ∼0.3 mg/mL (Milthorpe et al.  1977 ). The present study shows that insulin hexamers further self-associate isodesmically with a K D  of just under 100 μM. Weak self-association that is only evident at concentrations above ∼1 g/L requires extended treatment to account for non-specific repulsion, or ‘thermodynamic non-ideality’. In addition, making such measurements in a stopped-flow CG-MALS apparatus may be challenging due to the high viscosity of concentrated solutions, plugging of in-line filters, or high sample consumption. Fernández and Minton ( 2009 ) measured the self-association of chymotrypsin (CTR) at concentrations up to 70 g/L and various pH values by means of the in-place titration system described above. Minton ( 2007 ) argued for an analysis which assumes that—at sufficient ionic strength where long-range electrostatic repulsion is screened—non-specific/repulsive interactions can be described by an effective hard sphere model, and the effective specific volumes of all oligomers are equal to that of the monomer. While the homodimerization of CTR had been previously well-characterized up to several grams per liter, a new, weak self-association state was found to exist beyond 10 g/L—that of the pentamer or hexamer with a K D  on the order of several hundred micromoles/Liter. Small molecule–protein binding is not usually directly accessible to CG-MALS since the change in the M w  of the solution upon binding will be irresolvable. However, the effect of small molecules on protein–protein interactions often can be addressed. Some and Hanlon ( 2010 ) monitored the dissociation kinetics of α-chymotrypsin dimers upon exposure to AEBSF, a small molecule inhibitor. The initial concentration of CTR contained about 25 % dimers in equilibrium with monomers. Upon introduction of AEBSF, the dimers slowly dissociated such that the M w  approached that of a purely monomeric protein solution. The dependence of this dissociation rate on AEBSF concentration led to determination of the relevant kinetic parameters. The smallest molecule so far reported to have been characterized for self-association by CG-MALS is insulin (M w  = 5700 Da). Work is ongoing to study reversible self-association of peptides with molar masses of 1–4 kDa. Hetero-association Pioneering work in automated CG-MALS of the hetero-associating proteins CTR and STI was reported by Attri and Minton ( 2005b ). At pH 7.2 the self-association of CTR is weak, allowing these authors to ignore homodimers. However, a complete analysis of the equilibrium states must include 1:1 and 1:2 complexes and also inactive monomers of one or both species which, due to misfolding or other alterations, are incompetent to participate in the interaction. Fitting to different association models ruled out a simple 1:1 association, while a bivalent model assuming equivalent and independent (non-cooperative) binding sites did fit the data, especially when an incompetent fraction of CTR was allowed. The single-site affinity K D  = 330 nM was in good agreement with SE data acquired under similar conditions, and the inactive fraction of previously lyophilized CTR was estimated at 30 %. Simultaneous self- and hetero-association is amenable to CG-MALS analysis, as demonstrated by Kameyama and Minton ( 2006 ) for the interaction of CTR with bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) over a range of pH conditions that modulates CTR self-association. CTR and BPTI form a simple 1:1 complex, but 2:1 complexes due to BPTI binding to a CTR dimer were ostensibly not observed, indicating competition for the same site or at least complete mutual inhibition. Association constants of simultaneously occurring homodimers and heterodimers were calculated over the pH range 4.4–8.0. Excipients that interfere with isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) may not be detrimental to CG-MALS. Zhu et al. ( 2010 ) studied the interaction between a tau protein fragment and 7-kDa heparin in the presence of DTT, a reducing agent that is incompatible with ITC. CG-MALS indicated a simple 1:1 association with K D  = 330 nM, complementing the results of the ITC analysis in the absence of DTT. The bacterial cell division protein FtsZ not only self-associates reversibly as filaments, but also binds in vitro to ZipA, a membrane protein believed to be a part of the cell division machinery. Martos et al. ( 2010 ) investigated this hetero-association by means of a solubilized fragment, sZipA. The results of both the CG-MALS and SE analyses support the interpretation that only one monomer of sZipA binds to any given FtsZ protofilament, giving credence to the purported role of ZipA as a membrane anchor. The binding affinity of sZipA to the FtsZ chains was found to increase by approximately fourfold, from K D  ∼6 μM to ∼1.6 μM, when 1 mM EDTA was replaced with 5 mM Mg 2+  in the buffer. Flagellar motor proteins self-assemble to form a highly organized motor structure. Kenrick et al. ( 2012a ) investigated subunit assembly of the multi-domain flagellar motor proteins FliM and FliG by means of CG-MALS. In isolation, the middle domain of FliG binds to a site on the FliM middle domain with a K D  = 600 μM (confirming nuclear magnetic resonance analysis by Vartanian et al.  2012 ), while the C-terminal domain of FliG binds to a neighboring site on FliM with a K D  = 6 μM. The interactions of both FliG domains reach equilibrium within less than 20 s, forming 1:1 complexes. The association between the FliG protein expressed with both domains and FliM is qualitatively distinct from single-domain interactions, illustrating the evolution of a biochemical system from simple precursors to higher-order complexity. Figure  3  presents the CG-MALS data from a fixed concentration of FliM and varying concentrations of FliG. The stopped-flow delay time after each injection is 1 h. Equilibration of the association process is dramatically slower than the individual FliM domain binding event. A quasi-equilibrium analysis of the 1-h data points provided a best-fit model of 1:2 + 2:3 (FliM:FliG) with average per-site affinity of 10 μM, as illustrated in Fig.  3  (inset); presumably, had the reactions been permitted to continue, the complexes would have consisted of longer FliM–FliG chains. While we do not expect the observed kinetics to be biologically relevant—the in vivo process of motor assembly could be assisted by chaperones or otherwise affected by the cellular environment—it is striking that the C-ring assembly process initiates in vitro, even in the absence of supporting biological machinery and scaffolding.

 For best efficacy, biotherapeutics are expected to bind to their targets with high affinity, generally leading to K D  values in the low nanomolar range and down to the picomolar range. CG-MALS sensitivity is proportional to molar mass, permitting analysis of sub-nanomolar antibody–antigen or antibody–receptor interactions when state-of-the-art detectors are combined with well-prepared solutions (smaller proteins, such as CTR, STI, FtsZ, and sZipA would only be quantifiable down to single-digit nanomolar K D ). We have characterized several such interactions by CG-MALS, the tightest so far at K D  = 0.3 nM. Of the non-proprietary samples we have measured, α-thrombin (THR) and anti-thrombin immunoglobulin G (ATI) have so far presented the highest affinity at 9 nM per binding site (Fig.  4 ), comparing favorably to 15 nM determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (data available at: Haematologic Technologies, Essex Junction, VT). In contrast to ELISA, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and most other techniques suitable for this affinity range, CG-MALS not only shows unequivocally the 1:2 stoichiometry of an antibody–antigen interaction (SPR provides, at best stoichiometric ratio; see Rich and Myszka  2008  for the ambiguity inherent in SPR stoichiometry analyses) but also the presence of, or lack of other complexes such as homo-oligomers of either species or higher order hetero-complexes.

 Kenrick et al. ( 2012b ) extended the THR–ATI analysis to demonstrate how CG-MALS may characterize a three-body interaction. Anti-thrombin (AT; Haematologic Technologies) binds irreversibly to THR, potentially inhibiting the interaction with ATI. The concentration-dependent kinetics of THR–AT complexation were analyzed via CG-MALS (Fig.  5 ), exhibiting a 1:1 stoichiometric state with k on  = 6.09 × 10 3  s −1  M −1 , comparable to fluorescence-based measurements of 5.8 × 10 3  s −1  M −1  (Izaguirre et al.  2007 ) and surface plasmon resonance measurements of 9 × 10 3  s −1  M −1  (Elg and Deinum  2002 ). Approximately 23 % of the AT was found to be inactive, similar to the manufacturer’s data (21 %). For THR–AT–ATI interactions, a stock solution of THR–AT was prepared by incubating AT and an excess of THR for 1 h and then removing the inactive/unbound AT and THR by size exclusion chromatography. The THR–AT complex eluent was then combined with ATI to determine the affinity and stoichiometry of AT-bound THR with ATI. While the best-fit model was unchanged at 2(THR):1(ATI), the K D  increased from 9 to 300 nM, indicating a negative cooperativity most likely due to either steric hindrance or an allosteric reduction in the active site as per Gandhi et al. ( 2008 ). Fig. 5 THR–anti-thrombin (AT) binding kinetics, fixed AT concentration of 60 μg/mL, and varying THR concentrations.

 CG-MALS works just as well for oligonucleotides and peptides as for proteins. Bing et al. ( 2010 ) identified a 10-kDa streptavidin-binding DNA aptamer (APT). Since streptavidin (SA) exists as a native tetramer, the APT–SA stoichiometry potentially could be 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, or 4:1—or larger if APT itself is multivalent or either species self-associates. Kenrick et al. ( 2012c ) measured APT–SA interactions in a full CG-MALS gradient, shown in Fig.  6 . No evidence for self-association was found; the hetero-association data proved the availability of exactly two equivalent and independent binding sites on SA for APT, K D  = 190 nM. The latter result suggests that SA acts as a dimer of dimers where APT may bind to the cleft site, as confirmed by mass spectroscopy (Ruigrok et al.  2012 ). Fig. 6

  lines  (except best-fit model) are guides to the eye, and the self-interaction data are excluded as no self-association was evident. Conversion of LS signals to units of kiloDaltons gram per liter is approximate because APT and SA have different specific refractive index increment (dn/dc) values 
 The hetero-association of two multivalent macromolecules holds the potential for assembly of relatively large complexes. Figure  7  illustrates some examples of structures that could form from two bivalent molecules (Fig.  7a ) and from one bivalent and one dimerizing molecule (Fig.  7b ). CG-MALS is well-suited to analyzing these interactions thanks to its determination of solution molar mass which helps distinguish complexes with the same stoichiometric ratio but different absolute stoichiometries. The extended association states can be modeled as ‘metacomplexes’, i.e., the product of self-association of hetero-associated base units. For example, the  n : n  series of Fig.  7a  may be considered (XY) 1 , (XY) 2 , (XY) 3 , etc. Often this type of metacomplexation may be modeled conveniently as an isodesmic self-association of the base units, either finite (terminating at some  n -mer) if there is some limiting mechanism such as cyclization (ring formation), or infinite if the metacomplexation is open-ended. The association model is described by two association constants:  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

 Further evidence for the ‘dimer of dimers’ structure of SA, apparent in the crystallographic structure (Hendrickson et al.  1989 ), was found in its interaction with anti-streptavadin immunoglobulin G1 (ASI; kindly provided by S. Cao and J. Pollastrini, Amgen). CG-MALS data (Kenrick and Some  2012 ) indicated no self-association and peak SLS signals at a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio. However, as shown in Fig.  8a , the total light scattering intensity far exceeded that expected for the 1:1, 2:1, or 1:2 states. In a first-pass analysis the data are fit well by a model of infinite self-association of 1:1 sub-units, with an intra-sub-unit K D,1  of 22 nM and inter-sub-unit K D,2  of 50 nM. One might expect K D,1  = K D,2 , since the sub-units bind at the same sites that participate in intra-unit association. The lower inter-unit affinity could represent cooperativity that disfavors larger metacomplexes; back-calculation of the concentrations of each metacomplex shows that only (1SA:1ASI) 1 , (1SA:1ASI) 2 , and (1SA:1ASI) 3  appear at any appreciable level under these conditions. Further investigation of this system should include composition gradients at higher overall concentrations to test for correspondingly higher association states. Fig. 8

 A more complete analysis, presented in Fig.  8b, c , includes the additional  n  + 1: n  and  n : n  + 1 complexes that should exist in these networks alongside  n : n  complexes. Inclusion of those terms not only produces a somewhat better fit—with 1:2, 2:1, and 2:3 terms contributing significantly to the total light scattering—but the K D  determined from the associations constants of all complexes converge to the narrow range of 20 ± 5 nM, suggesting no cooperativity. CG-MALS analysis cannot distinguish conclusively between possible mechanisms behind the apparent bivalent nature of tetrameric SA, such as steric inhibition or specificity of the ASI complementarity-determining region for epitopes located along SA’s axis of symmetry. On the other hand, CG-MALS can be a quite powerful tool in confirming and fleshing out predictions based on structural models of the individual proteins, such as the expected ‘dimer of dimers’ behavior of SA (the author is not aware of attempts to predict this specific interaction). In our experience metacomplex formation is often accompanied by relatively slow kinetics. The SA–ASI interaction does exhibit such slow kinetics, clearly evident in Fig.  8a . At this time we have not attempted to analyze the kinetics in this rather complicated system; however, the equilibrium result of essentially a single K D  would suggest that one association rate and one dissociation rate could suffice to describe the entire temporal evolution. CG-MALS is particularly powerful in addressing some of the quite complex interactions exhibited by biological systems. We investigated the Cre- loxP  recombination system (purified enzyme and oligonucleotide kindly provided by K. Gupta and G.D. Van Duyne, University of Pennsylvania). Cre recombinase acts on  loxP , a 35-bp sequence from bacteriophage P1, to effect site-specific insertions, deletions, translocations, and inversions of DNA in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Previous work on this system utilizing electrophoretic mobility shifts assays (EMSA; Ringrose et al.  1998 ) and SPR (Rüfer et al.  2002 ) found that two Cre molecules bind to  loxP  with positive cooperativity. Although neither the protein nor DNA self-associate on their own, two Cre- loxP  units further associate to form a 4:2 synaptic complex that is necessary for catalysis; this assembly was previously examined by SE and EMSA (Ghosh et al.  2007 ). In a single three-hour CG-MALS run, we reached qualitatively similar conclusions as those obtained previously through these laborious and time-consuming processes, although a direct quantitative comparison has not yet been possible because of variations in the specific oligonucleotide sequence and length, catalytic mutations, and buffers. CG-MALS analysis indicated that, at pH 7.5, the first Cre attaches to  loxP  with a K D,1  = 30 –170 nM and the second Cre binds at an approximately tenfold greater affinity (4–17 nM), while the final reaction Cre 2 loxP + Cre 2 loxP ⇔ Cre 4 loxP 2  occurs with K D,synap  = 380 nM . For comparison, SPR determined K D,1  on the order of 6.5 nM and K D,2  of mid- to low-pM for ∼100–2000× cooperativity, while EMSA found a cooperativity factor of only 14; SE and EMSA determined K D,synaps  in the range of 10–14 nM. Association kinetics and the  r 
 g  sizes of the complexes, although available in the LS data, were not analyzed. Summary The real power of light scattering for the analysis of biomolecular interactions lies in a very basic yet essential aspect: the determination of solution molar mass and size, providing a direct window on simple or complex association states with minimal guesswork as to the meaning and interpretation of the observed signals. Future developments can be expected to include extending the range of equilibrium models; integrating the analysis of equilibrium and kinetics in order to further quantify site-specific interactions; integrating CG-MALS with CG-DLS analysis to facilitate low-volume, rapid determination of thermodynamic parameters via van t’Hoff analysis in the DLS plate reader The unique capabilities of CG-MALS and CG-DLS suggest that these techniques are destined to become essential tools in the hands of the physical biochemist. Researchers already utilizing batch light scattering for fundamental physical biochemistry will find that the automated apparatus increases their productivity and range of applications by an order of magnitude, while those utilizing other biophysical techniques, such as SPR or ITC, will discover the complementarity between these methods. Given its particular suitability to quantifying multi-species complexes, oligomerization, and aggregation under a large range of solvent conditions, one can envision CG-MALS pervading all fields of biological interactions from essential genetic manipulation and cellular machinery through the biology of disorders, such as beta amyloid aggregation or immune responses to viral agents. </Body>

    <Abstact>Resting skeletal muscle is a major contributor to adaptive thermogenesis, i.e., the thermogenesis that changes in response to exposure to cold or to overfeeding. The identification of the “furnace” that is responsible for increased heat generation in resting muscle has been the subject of a number of investigations. A new state of myosin, the super relaxed state (SRX), with a very slow ATP turnover rate has recently been observed in skeletal muscle (Stewart et al. in Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 107:430–435, 2010). Inhibition of the myosin ATPase activity in the SRX was suggested to be caused by binding of the myosin head to the core of the thick filament in a structural motif identified earlier by electron microscopy. To be compatible with the basal metabolic rate observed in vivo for resting muscle, most myosin heads would have to be in the SRX. Modulation of the population of this state, relative to the normal relaxed state, was proposed to be a major contributor to adaptive thermogenesis in resting muscle. Transfer of only 20% of myosin heads from the SRX into the normal relaxed state would cause muscle thermogenesis to double. Phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain was shown to transfer myosin heads from the SRX into the relaxed state, which would increase thermogenesis. In particular, thermogenesis by myosin has been proposed to play a role in the dissipation of calories during overfeeding. Up-regulation of muscle thermogenesis by pharmaceuticals that target the SRX would provide new approaches to the treatment of obesity or high blood sugar levels.</Abstact>
    <Body>Introduction The existence of a new state of myosin with a very low ATPase activity, the super relaxed state (SRX) has a variety of consequences for interpreting existing data on myosin function (Stewart et al.  2010 ). In particular, the SRX has been proposed to play a role in adaptive thermogenesis by resting muscle. The goal of the present review is to first briefly review the data supporting the existence of the new state. Thermogenesis by resting muscle and its role in whole body metabolism is considered. I then describe how the new state of myosin could provide a mechanism for thermogenesis and integrate this proposed mechanism into our current knowledge of muscle thermogenesis. I specifically discuss how the SRX could play a role in the response to overfeeding. Two fields of research into muscle function, one concerned with the contractile proteins as force generators and one concerned with the role of muscle in adaptive thermogenesis, should now find common ground. These two fields have previously had little interaction, and it is the goal of this review to try to bridge that gap. The ATPase activity of purified myosin is not compatible with the metabolic rate of resting muscle The presence of an inhibited state of skeletal myosin in resting muscle was first suggested more than 30 years ago when the ATPase activity of purified myosin was compared for the first time with the resting metabolic rate of the muscle from which it came (Ferenczi et al.  1978 ). Although the myosin ATPase activity was low, 0.011 s −1 , the heat produced by this activity alone would be greater than that observed for the living muscle by about a factor of five (Ferenczi et al.  1978 ; Kushmerick and Paul  1976 ). This was clear evidence that myosin must be inhibited in vivo by a mechanism that at that time was unknown. The degree of inhibition must be considerably greater than the factor of five, as the resting metabolism of skeletal muscle is low and, in addition to the metabolism of myosin, ATPase must also carry out other obligatory cell functions, such as protein synthesis, ion pumping, etc. A similar argument was made for rabbit myosin in comparison to living resting rabbit muscle (Gutierrez et al.  1989 ; Myburgh et al.  1995 ). The data discussed above lead unambiguously to the conclusion that in living resting muscle the ATPase activity of myosin must be inhibited to a level below that of isolated myosin itself. The existence of a new state of myosin is of interest in itself, as it is likely to play a role in muscle function. However, if the population of this state is regulated, with some myosins in the inhibited state while others are in a state with an ATPase activity similar to that of purified myosin, redistribution of myosin between the two states would have a large effect on resting muscle metabolism. As discussed below, the metabolism of resting muscle is variable, and this variability plays a significant role in determining whole body metabolic rate and can, consequently, influence important aspects of human health, such as obesity. To investigate this possibility, several years ago a search was initiated to find an in vitro system in which skeletal myosin could be observed in the inhibited state. Measuring single nucleotide turnovers in permeable muscle fibers Previous studies of in vitro muscle systems had failed to observe a myosin state with an ATPase activity that was sufficiently low to be compatible with living muscle. Several in vitro muscle systems have been extensively studied, including myofibrils and permeable muscle fibers. These preparations contain other proteins, in addition to myosin, with more rapid ATPase activities. A small inhibition of the ATP turnover times of myosin in myofibrils relative to purified myosin was observed, approximately a factor of two, which is in the right direction, but insufficient to explain the above discrepancy (Myburgh et al.  1995 ). One method for observing a slow ATP turnover in the presence of other faster enzymes is to measure single nucleotide turnovers using fluorescent nucleotides. The fluorescent ATP analog 2′-/3′- O -( N ′-methylanthraniloyl)-ATP (mantATP) has been shown to bind tightly to myosin (Woodward et al.  1991 ), with a twofold increase in quantum yield (Cremo et al.  1990 ), making it an excellent probe for studying myosin kinetics. A highly inhibited state of myosin in skeletal muscle was first observed by measuring single nucleotide turnovers (Stewart et al.  2010 ). The ATP turnover rate in relaxed permeable rabbit psoas fibers was measured by first incubating the fibers in mantATP followed by a chase with ATP. The fiber was relaxed in both solutions. During the chase phase, the fluorescence intensity of the fiber decreased as the bound mant nucleotides were released and replaced by ATP (Fig.  1 ). There was a rapid decay in fluorescence intensity followed by a slow decay. A second experimental approach was to incubate the fiber first in ATP, followed by a chase with mantATP, also shown in Fig.  1 . The intensity rose as ATP was released and replaced by mantATP. The change in fluorescence occurred in two phases that mirrored those of the first experiment, showing that the mantATP turnover rate was similar to the ATP turnover rate. The rapid phase, which has a time constant of approximately 20 s, comprises multiple factors, including the release of non-specifically bound nucleotides, the release of nucleotides by a fraction of the normally relaxed myosin heads, and the diffusion of released nucleotides out of the fibers, requiring approximately 10 s (Cooke and Pate  1985 ). The time constant for the second phase is much slower, 230 s, and as discussed below, it arises from the release of nucleotides by a second fraction of myosin heads with a very slow ATP turnover. Although the data described above were obtained from rabbit fast twitch psoas fibers, Stewart et. al. also showed that a similar SRX could be observed in slow twitch rabbit soleus fibers, with a slightly shorter time constant of 156 s (Stewart et al.  2010 ).
 Fig. 1 Fluorescence intensities are shown as a function of time during the chase phase of two single-nucleotide turnover experiments in permeable rabbit fast-twitch muscle fibers. The fluorescence decay occurring during a chase with ATP following an incubation with mantATP [2′-/3′- O -( N ′-methylanthraniloyl)-ATP] is shown ( red ,  open circles ). The rise in fluorescence intensity occurring during the inverse experiment in which the fiber was first incubated with ATP followed by a chase with mantATP is also shown ( blue ,  open squares ). The composition of the incubation and chase phases are shown above,  color-coded  with the data. The fluorescence changes in two phases, a rapid phase which has a time constant of approximately 20 s followed by a slow phase with a time constant of 230 s. The slower phase is attributed to the slow release of nucleotides from a fraction of myosin heads, which are in a “super relaxed” state. Reproduced with permission from (Stewart et al.  2010 ) 
 A number of observations led to the conclusion that the slow phase of fluorescence change, shown in Fig.  1 , arose from the slow turnover of nucleotides by myosin heads in the relaxed fibers. The magnitude of the fluorescence of the mant nucleotides specifically bound to the fiber was similar to that expected for binding to myosin alone. The slow release was only observed if the fiber was relaxed, and myosin is the only nucleotide binding protein that responds to the activation level of the fiber. Images of the fiber during the chase showed bright fluorescently labeled A-bands, which contain myosin. Adjusting for the non-specific fluorescence, 50% of the myosin heads were estimated to have been in the SRX in the initial incubation in the data shown in Fig.  1 . The conclusions, described above led to the proposal of a three-state model of myosin heads in muscle fibers, namely, active, relaxed and “super relaxed” (Fig.  2 ) (Stewart et al.  2010 ). The SRX explains the discrepancy described above between the more rapid ATPase activity of purified myosin and the much slower ATPase activity required to be compatible with the metabolic rate of living fibers (Ferenczi et al.  1978 ). If all myosin heads were in the SRX in living resting muscle under basal conditions, their ATPase activity would account for only 12% of the metabolic rate. Thus, one important conclusion from this comparison is that under basal conditions, most of the myosin heads must be in the SRX in living fibers.
 Fig. 2 The three-state model proposed for myosin with approximate nucleotide turnover times. In active muscle, myosin heads are primarily in the active state with rapid nucleotide turnover. In relaxed muscle, myosin can be in one of two states: (1) the normally relaxed state, with a turnover time approximately equal to that of purified myosin, which is 6 s for rabbit myosin at in vivo temperature or (2) the super relaxed state (SRX), with a much slower turnover time, 230 s. Two factors have been shown to alter rates between the relaxed state and the SRX. Myosin heads in active cycles increase the rate from the SRX to the relaxed state (Fig.  4 ). Phosphorylation (∼ P ) of the regulatory light chain ( RLC ) also favors the relaxed state, although it is not known whether this is due to increased rates from the SRX to the relaxed state, or to a decreased rate in the reverse direction 
 Structural and biochemical data show myosin ATP turnover is inhibited by the binding of myosin heads to the core of the thick filament This highly inhibited state of myosin, described above, was observed in skeletal muscle, a muscle in which regulation occurs by calcium binding to the thin filament. However, myosin with an even slower ATP turnover rate had already been observed in myosin filaments in which regulation occurs via myosin (Vibert and Craig  1985 ). Inhibition was observed when myosin heads were bound to the core of the thick filament. Early studies of the low-angle diffraction pattern of resting skeletal muscle showed that myosin heads are arranged in a helical array around the core of the thick filament (Huxley et al.  1965 ). Higher resolution structures of myosin heads in this array were provided by three-dimensional reconstructions of electron micrographs of relaxed myosin filaments from tarantula muscle (Fig.  3 ) (Alamo et al.  2008 ; Woodhead et al.  2005 ). The two myosin heads of one molecule interacted with one another in a structural motif resembling a “J”. This motif had been seen previously in two-dimensional crystals of unphosphorylated smooth muscle myosin (Wendt et al.  1999 ). The structure was only seen when myosin was in a relaxed state induced by the binding of ATP and the absence of phosphorylation. A helical array of heads bound to the thick filament was also observed at lower resolution in relaxed filaments from scallop muscle, a muscle controlled by binding of calcium to myosin (Al-Khayat et al.  2009 ; Vibert and Craig  1985 ). Myosin heads in the J-motif have a very low ATPase activity. In the absence of ATP filaments became disordered. The time required for disorder to occur during a rigor wash of scallop filaments provided an estimation of the turnover time of scallop myosin, 30 min, showing a remarkable degree of inhibition (Vibert and Craig  1985 ). A slow release of nucleotides was also seen for smooth muscle myosin in the folded conformation with an ATP turnover time of greater than 50 min, for a non-muscle myosin II and for folded scallop myosin (Ankrett et al.  1991 ; Cross et al.  1988 ). The structural motif seen in tarantula filaments is also found in a variety of other muscles. A similar ordered helical array of myosin heads in the J motif was resolved in myosin filaments from vertebrate cardiac muscle (Zoghbi et al.  2008 ). Although a high-resolution structure has not been resolved in filaments from skeletal muscle, the structural motif is stabilized by cross-linking and observed in purified monomeric skeletal myosin (Jung et al.  2008 ). The observation of the folded J structural motif in a variety of myosins, including those from both thick- and thin-filament-regulated muscles, led Craig and coworkers to propose that the structural motif is conserved across different species and muscle types (Craig and Woodhead  2006 ; Jung et al.  2008 ; Zhao et al.  2009 ). However, the J motif may not be the only motif to be associated with a strong inhibition of the myosin ATPase activity. Filaments in relaxed insect flight muscle show myosin heads in a different structural motif (Al-Khayat et al.  2003 ). Nonetheless, myosin heads remain in this structural motif for extended times in rigor conditions, showing that the release of nucleotides is slow (Reedy et al.  1992 ). The inhibition of motor activity by interaction with the tail or rod segments in a folded conformation may be a conserved mechanism for other motors in addition to myosin. A similar inhibited form has been shown to occur in kinesin (Hackney and Stock  2008 ).

 As discussed above, the presence of a structural motif in skeletal myosin, a motif associated with inhibition of ATPase activity, suggested that the inhibition of myosin activity seen in the SRX could also be associated with this motif. This hypothesis was supported by correlations between populations of myosin heads in the ordered helical array and those in the SRX (Stewart et al.  2010 ). Both the array and the SRX are only observed in relaxed thick filaments, both are increased by higher temperatures, and both are decreased by substitution of GTP for ATP (Kensler and Stewart  1993 ; Xu et al.  2003 ). Phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain (RLC) leads to disorder of skeletal muscle thick filaments seen in electron micrographs (Levine et al.  1996 ) and also leads to a lower population of myosin heads in the SRX (Stewart et al.  2010 ). These correlations led to the conclusion that myosin heads in the SRX are bound to the core of the thick filament and have the J motif. This is a parsimonious model that does not invoke a new structure. However, the data are also compatible with a model in which only a subset of the heads bound to the core of the filament are in the SRX (Stewart et al.  2010 ). Active fibers If myosin heads in the SRX are bound to the core of the thick filament, where they are unable to interact with actin, and their lifetime is long, how is skeletal muscle able to achieve maximal force in a few tens of milliseconds in a tetanic activation? There must be a mechanism in which the activation of the thin filament is sensed by the heads in the SRX, which then leave this state and begin to generate force. Stewart et al. (  2010 ) proposed that the mechanism involved a strong cooperativity between the myosin heads within a thick filament based on their observation that in a chase with ADP all myosin heads left the SRX and quickly turned over their nucleotides. This observation suggests that the interaction of some myosin heads with actin destabilizes the binding of adjacent myosin heads to the core of the thick filament. The structure of the relaxed filaments, shown in Fig.  3 , with myosin molecules interacting with adjacent myosin molecules could easily lead to highly cooperative interactions (Alamo et al.  2008 ). In this model, there must always be some fraction of the myosin heads in the normal relaxed state, which would sense the activation of the thin filament and initiate the cooperative process leading to full activation. Cooperative interactions between myosin heads are also evident in the X-ray diffraction patterns of fibers stretched so that only half of the myosin heads are overlapped by actin (Haselgrove  1975 ). During activation, all of the myosin heads leave their relaxed positions on the thick filament and become disordered. This indicates that myosin heads interacting with actin in the overlap region rapidly communicate with heads that do not interact with actin. More recently, more definitive data supporting the hypothesis for fiber activation posed above have been obtained. Fibers relaxed with mantATP were chased with an activating solution (Fig.  4 ). This resulted in the rapid release of all nucleotides from myosin. Thus, active myosin heads also destabilize myosin heads in the ordered array, as would be expected from the above hypothesis (Fig.  2 ).
 Fig. 4 Fluorescence intensities are shown as a function of time during a chase with a relaxing solution ( open circles, red ) or with an activating solution ( closed squares, blue ). In the relaxing solution, there is a slow release of nucleotides from the SRX, while in the activating solution all nucleotides are released in the rapid phase. The fibers were initially relaxed in 250 uM mantATP. The chase solution was either a relaxing solution, containing 4 mM ATP, pCa approx. 9, or an activating solution containing 4 mM ATP and calcium, pCa = 5.7. The fibers in the activating solution generated 60% of maximal tension 
 The dynamic nature of the resting metabolic rate of skeletal muscle Early investigations of muscle metabolism revealed that the resting metabolic rate of amphibian muscles could vary widely. For example, stretching a muscle to longer lengths could increase metabolism up to fourfold (Feng  1932 ). The increase occurred over several minutes and was reversible when the muscle was allowed to shorten to its original length (Clinch  1968 ; Feng  1932 ). The resting metabolic rate of frog muscle was also increased by higher external concentrations of potassium or by the addition of hyper-osmotic agents in the medium bathing the muscle (Solandt  1936 ; Yamada  1970 ). Hypoxia caused a decrease in the basal metabolic rate of resting frog muscle to 20% of the control rate and also greatly inhibited the increased thermogenesis seen after stretch and in the presence of higher potassium and hyper-osmotic agents (West and Boutilier  1998 ). The decrease in metabolic rate occurred despite stable ATP concentrations, suggesting that it is under the control of some signaling pathway (West and Boutilier  1998 ). Prolonged excess metabolism would be deleterious in the absence of oxygen. Subsequent investigations have shown that resting thermogenesis of mouse muscle can also be altered by high external potassium and hyper-osmolality (Chinet  1993 ; Chinet et al.  1992 ). During anoxia, resting mouse muscle has an extremely slow ATP turnover rate of 9 μM s −1 , which would require considerable inhibition of the myosin ATPase activity (Vinnakota et al.  2010 ). In summary, the resting metabolic rates of both amphibian and mammalian skeletal muscles are highly variable, undergoing large increases or decreases depending on the conditions employed, all of which occur in the absence of active force generation. Adaptive thermogenesis and the role of muscle Whole body energy intake can be broken down into several components (Fig.  5 ; for review, see Johannsen and Ravussin  2008 ; Levine  2004 ; Lowell and Spiegelman  2000 ; Wijers et al.  2009 ). An average adult human in our modern society (i.e. not engaged in intense physical activity) consumes approximately 8 MJ day −1 . Approximately two-thirds of this energy is used to fuel basic cellular functions, composed of the many exothermic cellular processes required for cell homeostasis, such as protein synthesis, ion pumping, cell division, etc. This component, known as the basal metabolic rate (BMR), does not change by a significant amount. Resting skeletal muscle has a low metabolic rate per unit volume, approximately 0.7 W kg −1  in rabbit muscle and 0.5 W kg −1  in human muscle. Although these rates are lower than those of many other tissues, such as brain or liver, skeletal muscle contributes about 25% of the obligatory thermogenesis due its large mass (Zurlo et al.  1990 ). A proportion of the energy taken in is expended by muscular activity. This component can vary widely depending on one’s lifestyle, and for people not involved in manual labor typically amounts to approximately 15–25% of the total (Levine  2004 ). There is a component of energy use, known as adaptive thermogenesis, which is altered by conditions, such as cold exposure and the ingestion of excess calories. The difference between the energy taken in and that used by the metabolic components given above is made up for by the storage or consumption of fat and, to a lesser extent, of protein and glycogen. Because the BMR does not change significantly, adaptive thermogenesis and activity both play an important role in maintaining body weight. This review will concentrate on thermogenesis by resting skeletal muscle, its role in adaptive thermogenesis and, in particular, on the question of what is the furnace within the muscle responsible for producing the heat. Our group has recently proposed a new mechanism for producing heat in resting muscle, discussed above, and this model will be integrated into the existing physiological data on adaptive thermogenesis and whole body metabolism.
 Fig. 5 Components of energy use in the human body. Energy intake in the diet for an average adult human in our modern society (i.e. not engaged in intense physical activity) is approximately 8 MJ day −1 . Approximately two-thirds of this energy is required for obligatory cellular functions. A variable amount is used to power physical activity. Adaptive thermogenesis, responding to exposure to cold and to nutritional state, is highly variable and typically amounts to around 25% of the total. The difference between energy intake and energy used by the factors listed above is either stored to—or retrieved from—lipids, proteins and glycogen. 
 Resting muscle thermogenesis increases following a meal and during exposure to cold (for review, see Johannsen and Ravussin  2008 ; Lowell and Spiegelman  2000 ; Wijers et al.  2009 ). Following a meal, whole body energy expenditure increases by 25–40% in humans (Sims and Danforth  1987 ). This is partially due to the energy required for digestion, absorption and storage of nutrients, which is an obligatory thermogenesis, but an additional heat is generated, above that required for digestion. This adaptive thermogenesis is produced by norepinephrine released from sympathetic nerves and by adrenal secretion of epinephrine, and a large portion of this metabolic process, approximately 40%, occurs in resting muscle (Astrup et al.  1986 ,  1989 ). Epinephrine has been shown to directly increase muscle thermogenesis (Astrup et al.  1989 ; Simonsen et al.  1992 ). Leptin is a hormone released by fat cells that leads to an increased metabolic rate and to reduced satiety. Leptin has also been shown to directly increase resting skeletal muscle thermogenesis (Dulloo et al.  2002 ). The response to cold exposure is complex and involves both non-shivering and shivering thermogenesis in skeletal muscle. Duchamp and Barre ( 1993 ) demonstrated that 70% of the non-shivering heat generated by ducklings during cold exposure was due to thermogenesis in skeletal muscle. Humans respond to cold exposure by increasing thermogenesis, which is regulated by the central nervous system via sympathetic stimulation (Dauncey  1981 ; Paolone and Paolone  1995 ; Simeckova et al.  2000 ; van Marken Lichtenbelt and Daanen  2003 ). As discussed above, epinephrine has been shown to activate thermogenesis, showing that skeletal muscle is involved in cold-induced thermogenesis. In summary, resting muscle thermogenesis responds to cold and to food consumption, and epinephrine and leptin have been identified as being involved in some of the pathways controlling this process. What is the “furnace” responsible for increased thermogenesis in resting skeletal muscle? Uncoupling proteins (UCP) are small transmembrane proteins in the inner mitochondrial membrane that can short circuit electron transport, creating a futile cycle that produces heat. The discovery of an UCP that is highly and selectively expressed in skeletal muscle, UCP3, led to the suggestion that this protein may play a dominant role in muscle thermogenesis (for review, see Costford et al.  2007 ). However, the results of other studies indicate that UCP3 has a less major role in muscle thermogenesis. The expression of UCP3 was found to increase upon fasting in humans (Gong et al.  2000 ; Vidal-Puig et al.  2000 ); this increase in a protein that wastes energy at a time when energy is being conserved undermined the hypothesis that it was a major site of thermogenesis. The over-expression or knockout of UCP3 in mouse muscle had little effect on thermogenesis by resting excised muscles, showing UCP3 did not play a major role in this process (Barclay et al.  2009 ). The UCP3 knockout mouse is neither obese nor cold intolerant, supporting this suggestion (Gong et al.  2000 ; Vidal-Puig et al.  2000 ). However, knockout of UCP1, known to play a role in thermogenesis by brown fat, also does not lead to obesity, although the knockout mouse muscle is cold-intolerant (Enerback et al.  1997 ). A variety of more recent studies have suggested that the major role of UCP3 in skeletal muscle is in the control of fatty acid metabolism and the mitigation of the deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species (for review, see Costford et al.  2007 ). The observation that the knockout of UCP1 does not lead to obesity shows that there are mechanisms that can compensate for the lack of thermogenesis. One possible pathway is the one suggested here, involving the modulation of the SRX. Changes in the rate of thermogenesis of resting muscle have been proposed to arise from increased ion fluxes or futile cycling of lipids. There is evidence that calcium fluxes account for approximately 20–25% of basal metabolism and can account for a portion of the response to hyperosmotic agents and high external potassium (Chinet  1993 ; Chinet et al.  1992 ; Dulloo et al.  1994 ). Calcium-dependent thermogenesis decreases upon the consumption of fish oil, providing a possible connection to diet (Dulloo et al.  1994 ). There is no method for directly measuring calcium fluxes, so the above data were obtained by observing the response to agents known to influence calcium flux. However, one agent commonly used in these studies, butanedione-monoxime, is known to also inhibit myosin ATPase activity, leading to an overestimate of the role of thermogenesis by calcium fluxes. Fluxes of sodium and potassium across the cell membrane have been shown to account for only 5% of resting muscle thermogenesis (Chinet et al.  1977 ) and for only 10–12% of thermogenesis potentiated by the administration of epinephrine (Chinet and Clausen  1984 ). Substrate cycling of lipids between synthesis and oxidation has been suggested to account for a portion of skeletal muscle thermogenesis in response to leptin (Solinas et al.  2004 ). The mechanisms discussed above undoubtedly play some role in skeletal muscle thermogenesis. The important observation, however, is that they have not been shown to account quantitatively for all observed muscle thermogenesis, leaving room for additional mechanisms to play a role. The existence of multiple mechanisms for producing thermogenesis is attested to by the lack of a phenotype in many knockout mouse models. The control of temperature in homotherms is so important that multiple mechanisms have been evolved to achieve it. I propose below that the myosin ATPase activity constitutes one of the “furnaces” that produces adaptive thermogenesis in resting skeletal muscle. This proposal is supported by its great capacity for heat generation and by the fact that the structure of the thick filament is known to be modulated by physiological mechanisms that would be expected to lead to thermogenesis. The role of the SRX in thermogenesis by resting muscle Changes in the relative populations of the relaxed state and the SRX can lead to dramatic changes in thermogenesis in resting muscle. Two factors govern the magnitude of possible changes: (1) the concentration of myosin heads in the fibers is large, approximately 220 μM; (2) the difference in ATP turnover time between the two states is great. As discussed above, most myosin heads must be in the SRX in living resting muscle under basal conditions. Shifting only 20% of myosin heads from the SRX into the relaxed state would increase muscle thermogenesis by approximately a factor of two, increasing whole body metabolic rate by about 16%. There is some evidence implicating myosin in the increased thermogenesis seen during the stretch and osmotic stress discussed above. Stretch of resting frog muscle has been shown to diminish the intensity of the myosin layer lines, indicating that the myosin heads become disordered (Haselgrove  1975 ). Both heat output and the change in myosin layer lines did not occur for modest stretch, but did occur at larger stretches (Clinch  1968 ; Haselgrove  1975 ). Both were of long duration and were reversible when shortened (Clinch  1968 ; Feng  1932 ; Haselgrove  1975 ). Heat output was inhibited by hypoxia, showing metabolic control (Clinch  1968 ; Feng  1932 ). The change in the layer lines did not occur if the muscle was left overnight, showing that the changes are not simply a steric consequence of altering muscle length, again suggesting metabolic control (Haselgrove  1975 ). Together, these results suggest that the changes in resting thermogenesis occurring during stretch may be due to changes in thick filament structure. It would be of interest to determine if there is a wider correlation between thermogenesis and thick-filament structure under a greater variety of conditions. The response of relaxed skeletal muscle subjected to small quick stretches is an increase in tension, known as the short-range elastic component, which has been attributed to attached cross bridges (Campbell and Lakie  1998 ). This response is potentiated both at long sarcomere lengths and by osmotic stress, both of which, as discussed above, also potentiate thermogenesis (Flitney  1975 ; Haugen and Sten-Knudsen  1981 ). Disordering of myosin heads is proposed here to produce greater thermogenesis and would also facilitate the interaction of myosin with actin. These interactions would be in weakly bound states that do not generate force, but contribute to stiffness. The observations described above, linking increased thick filament disorder and actomyosin interactions to conditions that lead to increased thermogenesis, provide additional support for the model of thermogenesis involving myosin. Does phosphorylation regulate the SRX in vivo? A strong case can be made for the potential involvement of phosphorylation of the RLC. The RLC is phosphorylated by a kinase that is activated by calcium via calmodulin (Gallagher et al.  1997 ). This phosphorylation does not occur to an appreciable extent during a single twitch, but does occur during a tetanus or a sustained sequence of twitches. Dephosphorylation is slow, requiring several minutes to reach baseline (Manning and Stull  1982 ). This system thus integrates over the recent history of activity to produce a particular level of RLC phosphorylation. RLC phosphorylation has been shown to potentiate the force of twitch contractions in fast twitch muscles (Zhi et al.  2005 ) and increase force at low levels of activation in permeable fibers (Persechini et al.  1985 ; Sweeney and Stull  1986 ). Phosphorylation of the RLC disorders the array of myosin heads bound to the skeletal thick filament and decreases the population of the SRX (Levine et al.  1996 ; Stewart et al.  2010 ). Disordered myosin heads would more readily interact with actin, explaining the potentiation of force at partial activation. In the model discussed here, an additional role of RLC phosphorylation is proposed. Phosphorylation potentiates force at partial levels of activation and potentiates myosin ATPase activity at even lower calcium levels, where force has been completely abolished. Both effects are due to a common action, namely, the disordering of the thick filament (Levine et al.  1996 ; Stewart et al.  2010 ). What fraction of the myosin heads are phosphorylated in human muscle during normal levels of activity? Phosphorylation levels are approximately 20–30% in both fast and slow twitch muscle fibers at rest, and these can double after a 10-s maximal contraction (Houston et al.  1987 ). A mouse model lacking the calcium activated kinase that phosphorylates the RLC is not obese (Zhi et al.  2005 ). This is a possible indication that RLC phosphorylation plays only a little role in thermogenesis. However, multiple pathways compensate for the knockout of mechanisms known to be involved in thermogenesis, including UCP1 (Enerback et al.  1997 ) and sympathetic stimulation (Bachman et al.  2002 ). In addition, there is another kinase that produces low levels of RLC phosphorylation, approximately 10%, in the knockout mouse (Zhi et al.  2005 ), and it is possible that this kinase is a mediator of thermogenesis. A second pathway that may influence the population of the SRX is the phosphorylation of myosin binding protein-C (MBP-C). MBP-C binds to the thick filament and has been shown to affect both thick filament structure and myosin function (for review, see Oakley et al.  2007 ). The knockout of MBP-C in mouse cardiac muscle produces disorder of the thick filament (Colson et al.  2007 ; Kensler and Harris  2008 ). MBP-C binds to the S2 portion of myosin adjacent to the head region, and it is thought to stabilize the binding of the head back to the core of the thick filament (Ababou et al.  2008 ). The cardiac MBP-C has three sites for phosphorylation and can be phosphorylated by a variety of kinases, including protein kinase-A, protein kinase-C and calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase (Oakley et al.  2007 ). Phosphorylation at some of these sites causes myosin heads to be released from the core of the thick filament and become disordered (Levine et al.  2001b ), leading to multiple consequences for cardiac myosin function (Colson et al.  2008 ; Tong et al.  2008 ). The role of phosphorylation of MBP-C in skeletal muscle has received much less attention. While cardiac MBP-C has three phosphorylation sites, the skeletal isoform has only one (Hojlund et al.  2008 ; Oakley et al.  2007 ). One report has shown that protein kinase A can phosphorylate MBP-C from slow and fast skeletal muscles (Lim and Walsh  1986 ). If this phosphorylation plays a similar role as in the mouse cardiac muscle, namely, producing disordering of the thick filament array, it would also affect the population of the SRX, thereby providing a direct connection to the thermogenic effects of epinephrine, which is known to activate protein kinase A. Response to long-term overfeeding The response of human subjects to long-term overfeeding has shown that individuals vary widely in the amount of weight gained upon overfeeding. While some subjects put on very little weight, others will store a major fraction of the excess calories as body mass, mostly as fat (for review, see Johannsen and Ravussin  2008 ; Levine  2004 ; Schoeller  2001 ; Wijers et al.  2009 ). What process expends the ingested calories that are not stored? Measurements of the resting metabolic rate and the thermic effect of a meal have shown that neither can account for a significant fraction. Because heavy exercise was limited in many of the studies, the unexplained expenditure of energy was attributed to less strenuous activities. The largest expenditure of excess calories, and the one that has been proposed to explain much of the wide variation in weight gain, has been non-exercise activity thermogenesis, known as NEAT (Dauncey  1990 ; Esparza et al.  2000 ; Johannsen and Ravussin  2008 ; Levine  2004 ; Levine et al.  1999 ,  2001a ; Schoeller  2001 ). NEAT includes any non-exercise movements and, in particular, has been proposed to depend on fidgeting. In one study, human volunteers were fed 4.2 MJ day −1  excess calories for 8 weeks (Levine et al.  1999 ). On average, approximately half of the excess calories (2.2 MJ day −1 ) were expended and half (1.8 MJ day −1 ) were stored. However, the variation in fat gain was large, varying from 0.4 to 4.2 kg (Fig.  6 ). Measurements of resting metabolic rates and the thermic effect of food showed only small changes that did not correlate with weight gain. By subtracting these two terms from total daily energy expenditure, the amount of energy expended by physical activity was determined. Because strenuous physical activity was limited, the energy expended was attributed to NEAT, which varied from −0.4 to 2.9 MJ day −1  (Fig.  6 ). The variation in NEAT was found to correlate well with that of weight gain. A number of studies have reported similar conclusions (Dauncey  1990 ; Esparza et al.  2000 ; Johannsen and Ravussin  2008 ; Levine  2004 ; Levine et al.  1999 ,  2001a ; Schoeller  2001 ).
 Fig. 6 Changes in non-exercise activity thermogenesis ( NEAT ) with overfeeding in healthy human subjects who were overfed by 4.2 MJ day −1  for 8 weeks. Fat gain is plotted on the  X-axis . Change in NEAT was calculated from NEAT values measured before and after overfeeding: NEAT = total daily energy expenditure − (basic metabolic rate + thermic effect of food). The energy expended in NEAT decreases as the weight gain increases, showing that excess energy intake is approximately balanced between either NEAT or fat gain.

 Can non-exercise muscle activity explain the large amounts of energy expended during overfeeding experiments? The efficiency of skeletal muscles is high, and it is notoriously difficult to reduce weight by exercise alone. One can estimate the energy required to perform a simple fidget, for instance, a leg swing. Let us assume that the work involves raising a 4-kg leg by 5 cm; the work done is approximately 2 J. Using the muscle efficiency measured during moderate cycling, 20–30%, (Gaesser and Brooks  1975 ), one fidget expends approximately 6–10 J. This is smaller than the 4 MJ day −1  overfeeding by more than five orders of magnitude. Although this calculation is only approximate, it is unlikely to be off by the orders of magnitude required for fidgets alone to explain the observed dissipation of calories by some subjects during overfeeding (Cooke  1999 ). Despite the high efficiency of muscle, a number of low-level activities have been shown to expend a reasonable amount of calories (Levine et al.  2000 ,  2001a ,  2005 ; Ravussin et al.  1986 ). There is a good correlation between energy output measured in a respiratory chamber and spontaneous activity (Dauncey  1990 ; Ravussin et al.  1986 ). Because people often engage in low-intensity exercise for a much greater length of time than they do high-intensity exercise, the former plays a larger role in energy expenditure (Johannsen and Ravussin  2008 ; Levine  2004 ). The changes in the energy expended during NEAT could arise from changes in the amount of activity or in the efficiency of performing light activities. The model of thermogenesis by myosin described here suggests a resolution of the discrepancy between the efficiency of muscle and the energy involved in low-intensity exercise. The energy expended in a fidget or light activity is small and brief; however, the use of the muscle may lead, through phosphorylation of the RLC or through other pathways, to a more prolonged disorder of the thick filament, resulting in a more extensive heat production in the resting muscle. As described above for rabbit muscle, the transfer of only 20% of myosin heads from the SRX to the relaxed state can double resting muscle thermogenesis. Assuming that human muscle is similar to rabbit muscle, the transfer of 45% of the myosin heads during waking hours would amount to 2 MJ day −1 , which is equal to the average energy dissipated by activity in the study by Levine et al. ( 1999 ). This level of phosphorylation is within the range measured for human muscle during moderate activities (Houston et al.  1987 ). This model would provide a source of thermogenesis that is additional to that required for the performance of mechanical work. If phosphorylation of the RLC is responsible for thermogenesis, heat generation would persist for several minutes following activity as that is the time course of increased phosphorylation (Manning and Stull  1982 ). Thus, this mechanism for thermogenesis would be expected to play a greater role during low levels of activity, where muscle spends an appreciable time in the mechanically relaxed states. This is just the type of activity that contributes to NEAT. Such a role is supported by the observation that muscle efficiency is increased in human subjects who are fasted to be 10% below normal body weight and is decreased when 10% above (Rosenbaum et al.  2003 ). The efficiency of walking also increases with weight loss (Foster et al.  1995 ). The higher efficiency at lower body weight and lower efficiency at higher body weight are both in the direction of returning to normal body weight, a known response to weight change. Of particular importance here is that the effects on efficiency are only seen at low levels of activity, 10 W, and they disappear at higher levels. As described below, there is also a stronger genetic component to muscle efficiency at low activity levels than at high ones, which again could be easily explained by the proposed model. Adaptive thermogenesis is controlled in part by genetic factors. The consequences to overfeeding in twins shows that there is a strong genetic component controlling the variation in weight gain, with approximately threefold more variability between pairs of twins than within pairs (Bouchard et al.  1990 ). There is also a genetic contribution to weight loss due to exercise (Bouchard et al.  1994 ). van Marken Lichtenbelt et al. ( 2002 ) found a large variation between individuals in cold-induced thermogenesis, 0.15–1.45 MJ day −1 . The increases in thermogenesis induced by cold exposure and by overfeeding are related, showing that these two responses are regulated by common mechanisms (Wijers et al.  2007 ). There is also a genetic determinant of muscle efficiency. At the same level of exertion, different individuals can display different metabolic rates. Studies of identical twins have shown that at low levels of exercise the variation in metabolic rate has high heritability, 40%, while for high levels of exercise the heritability disappears (Bouchard et al.  1989 ). The mechanism for thermogenesis presented here, which plays a more prominent role at lower levels of activity, would provide a possible framework for understanding the genetic components of adaptive thermogenesis. The hypothesis discussed above suggests that muscle activity and its effect on myosin is tightly connected to muscle thermogenesis. Is there also an effect of thermogenesis on muscle mechanics? By analogy with another motor, active muscle is akin to a car racing down the road, relaxed muscle is similar to a car stopped at a traffic light with the motor idling and the counterpart of the SRX is a car parked beside the road with the motor off. The car at the traffic light can transition to its active counterpart very rapidly, while the parked car requires more time. Is the same true of skeletal muscle? The transition from the relaxed state to the active state would be more rapid than that from the SRX, which must enter the active state by passing through the relaxed state (Fig.  2 ). In fast twitch muscle, factors that increase resting thermogenesis, such as myosin phosphorylation, epinephrine and cold exposure, also lead to potentiation of twitch tensions, showing that the muscle is more easily activated (Lannergren and Westerblad  1987 ; Williams and Barnes  1989 ; Zhi et al.  2005 ). Thus, disordering the thick filament will lead to thermogenesis, but it also has a beneficial effect on the fiber, making it more easily activated. However, slow twitch fibers do not have potentiated twitches under the same conditions (Lannergren and Westerblad  1987 ; Williams and Barnes  1989 ; Zhi et al.  2005 ). This fiber difference is unexplained, as the SRX has also been found in slow twitch fibers (Stewart et al.  2010 ). The SRX as a target for possible therapeutic applications The exact role of the SRX has yet to be quantitatively established. However, the magnitude of possible contributions to whole body metabolic rate is great. Up-regulation of thermogenesis could be an effective mechanism for treating obesity (Wijers et al.  2009 ). The net difference between obesity and normal weight can arise from a small difference between daily caloric intake and dissipation, averaged over periods of years. An increase in energy usage by 0.7 MJ day −1  for 1 year would lead to a weight loss of 7 kg of fat. A pharmaceutical that transferred 10% of the myosin heads from the SRX into the relaxed state would produce this increase in thermogenesis. Thus, pharmaceuticals targeting the SRX could be extremely effective agents for the treatment of obesity. Activation of the metabolic rate of skeletal muscle would also lead to lower blood glucose levels. Skeletal muscle is a large consumer of glucose. Following a meal, approximately one-third of the ingested glucose is stored in the liver, and insulin-mediated uptake by skeletal muscle is the destination of much of the remaining two-thirds. A major problem in type II diabetes is insulin resistance, in which insulin-mediated glucose uptake by tissues, including skeletal muscle, is impaired. It is well known that even moderate exercise can lead to decreased insulin resistance, making it an effective strategy for combating type II diabetes (Boule et al.  2003 ; Swartz et al.  2003 ). Activation of the resting metabolic rate via increased myosin ATPase activity could possibly produce effects similar to exercise. Resting muscle consumes fatty acids as a major fuel source, and up-regulation of resting metabolism would consume free fatty acids and reduce the deposition of lipid in muscle, both of which are thought to be involved in insulin resistance (Kovacs and Stumvoll  2005 ). In addition, ectopic expression of UCP1 in skeletal muscle increases resting energy use and also increases the metabolism of glucose (Klaus et al.  2005 ). Metabolic syndrome is a major and increasing problem in developed societies. The two characteristics of metabolic syndrome are obesity and type II diabetes and, as suggested above, both could be alleviated by up-regulation of the myosin ATPase activity in resting skeletal muscle. Summary A new state of myosin in relaxed muscle with a highly inhibited ATPase activity, the SRX, has been identified in skinned skeletal muscle fibers (Stewart et al.  2010 ). An obvious role of this state is to help achieve the low metabolic rate seen in resting in vivo skeletal muscle. Alterations in the population of this state have a very large capacity to alter muscle metabolism, and one physiological regulator, RLC phosphorylation, has been identified. The mechanism for muscle thermogenesis described here would operate in addition to other mechanisms that have been identified. It would function during low-level activities, which have been shown to play a major role in body weight maintenance. The identification of SRX provides a new avenue for research that links a variety of previously disparate areas, including muscle mechanics, muscle thermogenesis, diabetes and weight control. </Body>

    <Body>Introduction As discussed earlier in this book, there are sea coast cities worldwide that are at risk from floods, storm surges, and extreme weather conditions such as wind-driven high category hurricanes (typhoons, monsoons), or drought and heat waves, plus along Pacific Ocean coasts, earthquakes and tsunamis. A municipality and its public health services have to be prepared to adapt to their preparations to deal with what contemporary experiences and history reveal are the most likely physical hazards and diseases to impact it. The two main preparatives are first to be able to care for the injured during a hazard event at well-staffed and supplied hospitals and medical clinics or field hospitals. The second is to fill the basic needs of affected populations with clean water, food, shelter, toilets, waste collection, and if necessary power restoration. These primary responses will help to reduce the chance of an onset and spread of disease. It is important to activate search and rescue teams help citizens isolated or trapped by the event that did not or could not evacuate such as in the case of extreme weather and flooding. In addition, where there have been deaths, bodies should be recovered and interred as soon as possible in order to prevent sickness that might originate from them. For instances of collapsed structures with people trapped inside, equipment that can move debris and rescue people or recover the deceased is necessary as would be the case for less common strong earthquakes as well as some extreme storm events. What was just described may be a good template to follow, but in reality, many sea coast cities in developing and less developed countries do not have the resources to cope with severe hazards that might impact them. Here, the World Health Organization and developed nations, large and small, have sent in personnel, supplies, and equipment to help an impacted sea coast city (or inland city) in the past and will surely continue to do so in the future. Disease Control  Disease control after a natural disaster often means initially dealing with diarrheal diseases (dysentery) from the ingestion of contaminated water or food, and lack of sanitation facilities (toilets, hand-washing stations). It may mean dealing with cases of the infectious diseases like cholera (bacterium  Vibrio cholera ) or typhoid (bacterium  Salmonella typhi ) that originate from contaminated water or food or from contacts with cholera or typhoid carriers. To prevent a spreading epidemic status means making safe water and food, sanitation and hand-washing posts available. In the case of cholera, an epidemic may be avoided by isolating the cholera carriers and treating them (with hydration and antibiotics) or oral cholera vaccines where the disease is endemic until the threat of spread is under control. During March 15–16, 2019, the monsoon Idai flood ravaged Beira, Mozambique, a sea coast city of 533,000 people, and tracked inland into areas of Zimbabwe and Malawi flooding them and killing a total of over 1000 people. In Beira, the drinking water supply and the sewage infrastructure were damaged. Cholera cases were diagnosed and the disease spread rapidly with over 4000 cases identified with 7 deaths by the April 9. The WHO assembled more 975,000 doses of cholera vaccine (oral) and starting April 3 delivered more than 487,000 initial doses to Beira citizens and those in other affected populations, but only about 2 weeks after the disease was first diagnosed. A second inoculation 2 weeks later gives full protection from the disease. Adaptation would require vaccine storage stations set up in regions where outbreaks of endemic and other infectious diseases occur so that those that can be controlled by vaccination could be serviced more rapidly than was the case in Mozambique. Infectious Diseases In the above section, infectious diseases that could follow natural disasters that affect sea coast cities were discussed. In this section, infectious diseases that can affect sea coast cities by developing from within or those that are carried in from outside sources are considered. These would be water- and food-borne contaminants and vector-borne bacteria/viruses (by insects, animals, humans). Important factors that have to be considered by public health personnel in sea coast cities in order to be prepared to deal with disease include a location’s latitude and elevation as they influence climate (temperature and humidity). Sea Coast City Climate Zones and Endemic Diseases Important sea coast cities are located in most geographic climatic zones. As such, and based on a history of urban health problems, their populations may be susceptible to one or more than one infectious disease that public health services should be prepared to treat. Six principal climate zones (Mediterranean, tropical, arid, temperate, polar, and mountainous) are classified on the basis of average monthly temperature and precipitation. Temperature and precipitation are determined in grand part by latitude, altitude/landform, and the influence of surface and subsurface ocean currents flow paths, location of mountains and their elevations, and seasonal wind directions. The principal zones are a simplification of a 12 zone classification, each with sub-zones (Table  6.1 ) [ 1 ]. Missing from this classification is a mountainous one because with their masses and elevations they establish their own micro-zones and affect weather patterns of some of the other zones. Table 6.1 Twelve zone, multi-sub-zone climate classification [ 1 ] Rainforest High rainfall (175–200 cm annually, mean monthly temperature &gt;18 °C) Monsoon, typhoon, hurricane Seasonal regional rainy season (North and South America, Sub-Saharan Africa, Australia, and East Asia) Tropical savanna Semi-arid to semi-humid regions in sub-tropical and tropical latitudes with temperature at or &gt;18 °C with rainfall between 75 and 127 cm annually (widespread in Africa, found in India, and northern parts of South America, Malaysia, and Australia) Humid sub-tropical Winter rainfall mainly from thunderstorms. Mainly on east side of continents between about 20° and 40° latitudes away from the equator Humid continental Large seasonal temperature range with 3 months of temperatures &gt;10 °C and coldest month temperature &lt;−3 °C Oceanic climate Along west coasts of all continents at middle altitudes and in SE Australia with lot of precipitation year-round Mediterranean climate Hot, dry summers and cold, wet winters. Mediterranean Basin countries, western North America, parts of Western South Australia, SW South Africa Desert Little precipitation (dry), large temperature range daily (up to 45 °C and down to 0 °C) and seasonally hot, during day, cold during night, all year except Antarctica Steppe Dry with temperature that can range from 40 °C during the summer to −40 °C during the winter Subarctic climate Little precipitation and with permafrost. Temperatures of &gt;10 °C for 1–3 months and for 6 winter months &lt;0 °C Tundra In the far Northern Hemisphere especially in extensive areas of northern Russia and Canada. Very cold all year Polar icecap Dry, very cold, all year  Sea coast cities in a similar stage of economic development and in the same climate zones are likely to have exposure to a similar group of endemic infectious diseases. For example, in Southeast Asia, Jakarta, Bangkok, and Ho Chi Minh City, are hot (30 °C) with higher humidity (75% RH) and have endemic infectious diseases that originate from contaminated water and food, and those that originate from vector-borne carriers. Country reports show that in the endemic infectious group, all live with the threat of bacterial diarrheal diseases, and two cities live with the threat of Hepatitis A and typhoid fever. In the second group, the three cities have exposure to dengue fever and malaria while two are threatened by Japanese encephalitis, and one with HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. In Africa, Mombasa, Kenya in East Africa, population 537,000 and Luanda, Angola in West Africa, population 2.5 million, are located relatively close to the equator (4° 3′S and 8° 50′S, respectively) and have similar temperatures of 25–3 °C and 60–65% relative humidity defining their Mediterranean/sub-tropical to hot humid tropical climates. However, unlike the Southeast Asian sea coast cities with similar infectious disease burdens cited above, Mombasa and Luanda infectious disease burdens differ greatly. Mombasa residents are at risk from malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDs and recently from a resurgent occurrence of polio, measles, and kanazaar (parasitic disease  Leishmania donovani ). Luanda, Angola residents are at risk from yellow fever, malaria, typhoid fever, and Hepatitis A. Mombasa, an important Kenyan port city also serves Uganda, Rwanda, the Eastern region of the DR Congo. This put the Mombasa population at risk of infectious diseases that may be carried from those countries by people or products. This possibility for infectious disease transfer was supported when public health personnel recently identified an Ebola strain in Kenyans who visited West Africa. The West African region had suffered an Ebola epidemic during 2013–2016. The disease likely began in a village of southeast Guinea as a young boy infected by bats (bushmeat) was carried by exposed villagers to its capital and port city Conakry (population 1.8+ million). The Ebola virus was spread by carriers to the Liberian capital and port city Monrovia (population 1 million with 41 doctors), and to the Sierra Leone capital and port city Freetown (population 1+ million). The World Health Organization, medical teams and NGOs from other nations worked to stop the epidemic but only after more than 11,300 died and more than 28,000 were infected and saved. An as-yet unapproved Ebola vaccine was used here and was instrumental in halting the spread of the Ebola virus. Major sea coast cities in South America and the Indian sub-continent have similarities and differences of infectious disease risks as do the sea coast cities Mombasa and Luanda cited above. Public health services staffed with appropriate personnel, supported financially, with medicine stocks plus WHO vaccination stores can be prepared to use them to halt the spread of an infectious disease to prevent an epidemic or to deal with an epidemic that may develop. On August 1, 2018, there was an outbreak of Zaire Ebola virus in North Kivu province of the DR Congo that spread to Ituri Province. In March, 2019, WHO reported that there were more than 1029 cases and 642 deaths. The public health ministry medical experts identified the disease, did contact tracing, contained and treated infected people, and worked to educate the threatened populations of the risk of not reporting Ebola cases, and unsafe burial practices (touching and washing the dead) that is meeting cultural resistance. As important in dealing with the epidemic was the acceptance of the use of the experimental Ebola vaccine that helped stop the spread of the Ebola disease in West Africa a few years earlier. The vaccine was given to 3300 people who had direct or indirect contact with people with the disease. However, the application of the Ebola vaccine and a halt in the rise of infections has been hampered by armed group violence and unsafe burial practices. The disease is recurrent in the DR Congo with ten outbreaks since the discovery of the disease in 1976 [ 2 ]. The hope is that it will not become entrenched. One adaptation to infectious disease prevention in this time of ready transnational transport of people globally via sea, air, and land is vaccination control. Vaccinations against infectious diseases keep a nation healthy and productive. A low rate of vaccination in a country or regions for years on end can be damning to its citizens and to people where they travel within that country or internationally. The WHO warns that vaccine hesitancy is one of the top ten global threats of 2019. Vaccination hesitancy can be the result of personal philosophical or religious beliefs that allow parents to opt out of this protection for their children as in the United States where there have been major measles outbreaks in eight states and reported cases in 20 other states. In many of these states legislatures are proposing laws to minimize exemptions to measles vaccination requirements for children of school age. A judge in Brooklyn, New York, following a serious outbreak of measles in children of a religious sect during April, 2019, mandated application of the MMR measles vaccine (including mumps and rubella) to all their children to protect the general public. This was done over the religion leaders objections to vaccinations. During 2018, Europe (53 countries) reported that measles killed 72 children and adults of the 82,500 people that contracted the measles virus due in part to a vaccination rate (&lt;90%) less than the 95% WHO deems necessary to prevent epidemics and in part to easily travel between countries. In a recent deadly outbreak, Madagascar is working to contain a measles epidemic that began in September, 2018 and by February, 2019 had killed more than 900 people (64% children to age 14) and infected more than 68,000 persons. This epidemic is the result of a low immunization rate for many years and has spread throughout the country including Madagascar’s most important seaport, Toamasina, and other ports of entry. This, in spite of the fact that a safe and effective vaccine, has been available for the past 50 years but whose application has not been mandated by the national government. Travelers from Madagascar to other countries are potential carriers for about 2 weeks (4 days before a rash appears, plus 6 days during the rash, and for 4 days after the rash disappears). For this reason, the vaccination history of people entering a sea coast city or other ports of entry who come from or have passed through areas that are suffering or have suffered infectious disease events is important. This would require the collaboration of immigration officials who would be charged with checking the vaccination cards of people (ship personnel, tourists, immigrants, and asylum seekers) at sea coast city ports of entry. The same would be true for other ports of entry. It may require making spot checks of, for example, fever or an observational feature (sweating, paleness) of arriving passengers from specific locations suffering from outbreaks of infectious diseases. This was the case by fever checks in airports and other points of national entry after China revealed the spread of the SARS (severe acute, respiratory syndrome) infectious disease during 2002–2003. Human Activities Sources of Non-Communicable Diseases Non-communicable diseases whether in highly and densely populated sea coast or inland cities can sicken and kill citizens. The focus on the causes of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) that are responsible for 41 million of premature deaths annually and a far greater number of debilitating sicknesses has been on behavioral and metabolic causes and how to reduce their threats to societal health and its effect on city and national economies. These causes include tobacco use, alcohol abuse, poor nutrition, lack of exercise, obesity, and hypertension. Of the 41 million premature deaths cited above, ~35 million are in low and middle income countries. Seventy-nine percent of the NCDs are attributed to cardiovascular disease (17.9 million), cancer (9 million), respiratory disease (3.9) million, and diabetes (1.5 million). Public health education programs have to be continually implemented to reduce harmful behavior and causes [ 3 ]. Pollution To this point in time, not enough attention has been given to pollution as a principal factor in NCDs illnesses and even premature deaths and their socio-economic consequences [ 4 ]. These are often expressed by a calculation of DALYS (disability adjusted life years), the total number of years lost to illnesses, disability, or premature deaths in a given population for a certain disease or disorder [ 5 ]. This can be a serious problem in high population sea coast and inland cities with high densities of citizens especially when there are edge neighborhoods with poor and marginalized people living in shantytowns/slums with unsafe water, lack of toilets, and problems with garbage/waste collection. The loss of productivity because of DALYS lowers GDP levels by up to 2% annually, especially in low middle income countries (incomes of US$1026 to US$4035), such as Bangladesh, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Vietnam. Cities are most affected because they account for 85% of global economic business [ 6 ]. Pollution is a bane of humanity. Air, water, soil, and food pollutants contribute to the premature deaths of millions citizens and sickens many millions more from NCDs. Pollution-caused diseases accounted for about 9 million premature deaths in 2015 or 16% of all deaths globally (&gt;56 million). Of the 9 million premature deaths, about 70% of these (e.g., cardiovascular disease, COPD) were from pollution-caused NCDs, mainly in low income and low middle income countries [ 4 ]. Pollution is most damaging to people and economies where environmental laws protecting people and ecosystems from pollution have not been instituted or if laws have been passed but are not enforced. Pollution does not distinguish between sea coast and inland cities but as noted above is most damaging where there are high and dense populations breathing, drinking, and eating pollutant bearing matter. The effect of ingestion of pollutants that cause NCDs is not instantaneous but acts slowly over a period of time gradually attacking the normal functioning of body organs as pollutants access and bioaccumulate in them. Pollution can be greatly mitigated in three ways: (1) taxation has been effective in minimizing/eliminating the mass of pollutants emitted into the atmosphere or discharged into waterways or onto soils; (2) investment in pollutant capture and control equipment and safe disposal of the captured pollutants; and (3) legislation enforced by the threat and actions of closure of a pollutant-generating operation, by fines, or by incarceration of responsible individuals. Of the ~9 million premature deaths caused by pollution, ~7 million are from indoor air pollution (2.9 million) and outdoor air pollution (4.2 million) [ 7 ]. There are 1.8 million people that die annually from water pollution (bacterial, viral, heavy metals) and 0.5 million from soils polluted with heavy metals and toxic chemicals (e.g., pesticides) ingested through foods. From an economic perspective, pollution frequency costs in the range of 4–5% of a nation’s GDP and for some this exceeds what they receive in development aid [ 8 ]. Air Pollution Diseases that originate from indoor air pollution include stroke, coronary artery and ischemic heart diseases, chronic obstruction pulmonary disease (COPD), acute lower respiratory infections in children, and lung cancer. Outdoor air pollution diseases are much the same but with less coronary artery disease. Sickness and deaths from indoor air pollution are the result of poor or no venting of gases and fine size particulates (&lt;2.5–10 μm) from the fuel used (e.g., soft coal, charcoal, wood, dried animal waste) for cooking and/or heating. Improved venting of indoor generated pollutants to the outside can reduce sickness and deaths especially for the more susceptible old people and small children but will add these toxins to outdoor air pollution. The effects of indoor air pollution can be eliminated by bringing natural gas to homes for cooking and heating and proper venting of emissions. This solution is lacking in some major sea coast and inland cities with highly populated shantytown/slum in inner city or edge neighborhoods. Outdoor air pollution comes from multiple sources such as coal-burning power plants, various industries, vehicular traffic, and construction. These sources, individually or in consort, emit or raise fine size particulates (&lt;2.5–10 μm), and other toxic emissions into the air that include sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, and heavy metals (e.g., lead [Pb], mercury [Hg], arsenic [As], cadmium [Cd], and others). These toxic emissions may be inhaled or deposited onto soils or into waters where they can enter a food chain via agricultural crops (e.g., Cd in rice) and food fish (e.g., Hg in tuna, swordfish, king mackerel). Under some meteorological conditions, toxic emissions from industries and vehicular emissions will contribute to a sickening or killer smog. Air pollutant abetted diseases are most prevalent among major sea coast and inland cities with upwind nearby major industrial development and in shantytown/slum populations vs. economically more advantaged populations. The mandated use of pollutant capture and control technologies can mitigate the emissions of toxins from industrial sources cited and together with the inclusion of catalytic converters on vehicles can reduce the number of premature deaths abetted by outdoor air pollution. As cited previously, taxation of emission masses can mitigate the problem as can fines, plant closure until facilities becomes compliant with government legislative mandates, or the threat of imprisonment of plant owners [ 9 ]. Several major sea coast cities with high populations with very high and relatively high densities in developing countries suffer greatly from air pollution. These include Dhaka (47,400 people/km 2 ), Mumbai (26,400/km 2 ), Abidjan (13,700/km 2 ), Kolkata (11,200/km 2 ), Jakarta (9800/km 2 ), Ho Chi Minh City (6800/km 2 ), Bangkok (5200/km 2 ), Guangzhou (5200/km 2 ), Zhangjiang (5000/km 2 ), Tianjin (4900/km 2 ), and Ningbo (4000/km 2 ). In some of these cities, the air pollution threat is elevated by high numbers of poor populations living in shantytowns/slums where densities are higher than the average for a city and where the health status of a population is not as resistant to sickness and disease as it is in economically advantaged inner city populations. For example, in 6.5 million people of the Mumbai 23.3 million population live in shantytowns/slums as do 3.8 billion people of Kolkata’s 13.3 million population. Similarly, of the 17.4 million population in Dhaka, 5.2 million live in shantytowns/slums. Perhaps most striking is that of the Lagos population of 14.8 million people, 8.8 million live in shantytowns/slums. In comparison to the densities of major coastal seaports , those in developed countries are generally less and without a significant slum populations (e.g., Rotterdam [3100/km 2 ], Hamburg [2700/km 2 ], Los Angeles [2300/km 2 ], New York [1700/km 2 ], and Antwerp [1600/km 2 ]) [ 10 ]. Because of the concern for citizens health and the economic losses from workdays lost or even years of an individual’s contribution to a nation’s development lost, municipal governments have been monitoring air pollution and identifying specific sources of air-borne toxins. In some cases, they are enforcing existing legislation or carefully planning legislation with enforcement powers that mandate the use of best available technologies at all toxic emissions sources and safe disposal of the captured pollutants. If enforcement is applied, it will greatly reduce toxin loading of pollutants into the atmosphere and hence reduce the risk to the health and premature deaths of great numbers of people. This will be effective only if enforcement of laws curbing air pollution is not just an empty threat because of a nation’s drive for continued economic development or because of a culture of corruption. Water Pollution  Water pollution comes from the atmosphere as rain precipitates toxins from industrial emissions, especially coal-fired power plants and other sources into waterways or onto land where contaminants may run off into waterways. Water pollution comes as well from toxins in industrial effluents discharged onto land that can runoff into streams and rivers. Rainwater or streams that flow through talus piles of mine wastes can dissolve out heavy metals and carry them overland into waterways. Acid mine drainage from abandoned and functioning operations contaminates streams/rivers into which it discharges. Bacterial pollutants from human wastes where toilets are not used or where the wastes are collected but not treated can pollute waterways as do wastes and agricultural chemicals as runoff from farmland and commercial animal husbandry (e.g., cattle feed lots, chicken production). The toxin runoff, whatever the source(s), affects not only humans but ecosystems and their natural resources that are important to people. Contaminated waters can be cleansed to drinking standards by passing them through a treatment plant before distribution to consumers. Toxin-bearing surface runoff cited above can also seep through a surface cover into aquifers and contaminate groundwater. Under some conditions, groundwater can dissolve heavy metals that may be in aquifer rocks thus polluting water downflow from where the toxic metals originate. As with surface sources of water, polluted groundwater can be treated to remove a heavy metal pollutant or more than one, or other chemicals before being released for human use (drinking, cooking, personal hygiene) or for irrigation of food crops. The sickening of citizens in well-populated sea coast cities from ingestion of pollutants in unsafe drinking (and cooking) water is a grave concern especially in poor neighborhoods that lack access to clean water vs. economically advantaged neighborhoods that receive treated clean water [ 11 ]. Soil to Food Pollution Sea coast and inland cities with large and growing populations (e.g., in the millions) obtain much of their foods from distant national and international sources. The reality is that some agricultural products (e.g., grains, vegetables, tobacco) may contain toxins taken up from soil or irrigation water polluted by human activities. These include heavy metals and pesticides/herbicides. If contaminated products are consumed over time, their toxin contents can build up in body organs (e.g., kidneys, lungs) and cause NCDs (see Sect.  6.3 ). Toxin build up can also disrupt the normal functioning of nervous and cardiovascular systems, and renewal of skeletal matter. The ingestion of human generated soil/food pollutants can cause NCDs [ 12 – 14 ]. In addition to soils being polluted by industrial and agricultural sources, soils can have natural high concentrations of potentially toxic metals. If a rock contains heavy metals (e.g., black shale) and a soil forms from it as it degrades and decomposes, contaminant metal(s) may be retained in the soil. One pathway to humans is ingestion of one or more of the potentially toxic metals taken up by agricultural crops (food or a non-edible product such as tobacco) being grown in a heavy metal polluted soil. Another pathway is from rainwater that seeps through a naturally contaminated soil that reacts with it to release a heavy metal that seeps through the soil into an underlying aquifer. Here, the path is toxic metal from rock to soil to agricultural products or drinking/cooking water that can do the same harm to the human body as noted in the previous paragraph by bioaccumulation in and damage to vital organs and also cause medical symptoms and the onset of a NCD. Examples of NCDs caused by heavy metal poisoning abound in the literature [ 12 ,  13 ]. Whether a NCD will develop from ingestion of a potently toxic metal depends on several factors. These are the dose absorbed by a body, the route and duration of exposure to chemical species that can cause chronic or acute illness, age, gender, genetics, and health conditions of exposed individuals. Perhaps most studied in recent years are cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), mercury (Hg), and chromium (Cr). There are natural sources of potentially toxic metals (e.g., rocks containing arsenic-bearing minerals, ores, volcanic gases, and particulates). However, great masses of the heavy metal pollutant load in the atmosphere, water bodies, and soils come from human sources. These include industrial operations emissions and effluents, especially from coal-fired power plants, mining and smelters, and factories that manufacture batteries, pharmaceuticals, fertilizer and biocides, paper, pulp, and wood preservatives, among others. Sources for each metal or a group of metals that are thought to be linked to an epidemiology-defined disease node can be traced by following geological/geochemical principles used in the search for mineral deposits. Governments can then take action to greatly reduce or eliminate the source(s). The fundamental question exists as to whether a government should make regular spot analyses to determine if there is a risk of heavy metal poisoning from agricultural food stuffs. In theory, the answer is yes. Realistically, however, analyses would be done but only after a heavy metal was identified fortuitously or if public health professionals detected symptoms of heavy metal poisoning in a population. Heavy Metal Pollutants Harmful to People and Ecosystems Heavy metals are important to industrial development as well as to human health. There are heavy metals that are essential micronutrients for the optimal functioning of biological processes and organs in humans in a quantity of a few milligrams (mg) or micrograms (μg) daily. These are Fe (iron), Zn (zinc), Co (cobalt), As (arsenic), Cr (chromium), Cu (copper), Mn (manganese), Mo (molybdenum), Se (selenium), and V (vanadium).  However, these may become toxic if ingested and bioaccumulated over time to higher concentrations than are necessary to satisfy nutritional needs.  As noted in a previous paragraph, heavy metals that are most toxic to humans (+ animals and ecosystems) if ingested regularly in water and/or food are As, Pb, Hg, and Cd. These metals can bioaccumulate in a body and have toxic effects on different vital organs. In addition, they can interfere in the functioning of essential elements and their metabolic processes. These four heavy metals have been well-studied by toxicologists and other scientists for sources, mobility in ecosystems, and toxic effects. Their maximum allowable World Health Organization limits via oral intake in μg/day are Pb (10), Hg-inorganic (15), As-inorganic (15), and Cd (5) [ 15 ]. In the past and the present, old established sea coast cities have been centers of industrial development ofttimes within and/or upwind and upriver of cities. This, and increasing urbanization as populations grow, fueled increased utility and transportation needs. The release of heavy metals from industrialization, utility sources, and vehicles into a city environment and associated ecosystems on land and in the oceans can be an inherited legacy or existing danger to public health through bad air and contaminated water, soils, and foods. How sea coast cities (and inner ones) and national governments have adapted to mitigate toxic metal pollution is reflected in the health status of their populations. Lead: Pb Lead represents an inherited legacy that is an existing health threat in and surrounding old homes from Pb in drinking water that passes through utility and home pipes containing Pb or pipes joined with Pb-containing solder. This problem is being addressed by replacing the pipes, by regularly flushing and cleansing city water pipe networks, and by meeting WHO standards at treatment facilities. Lead bearing soil dust from vehicular sources has been basically eliminated since the phasing out of leaded gasoline that began in the 1970s and 1980s with the introduction of catalytic converters. However, inherited Pb in soils can be a health hazard. A city may opt to replace a soil, cover it, or otherwise remediate it especially at playgrounds. Cities were early in adapting to the Pb-based paint problem by 1965 recommendations that the amount of Pb in interior and exterior paint be reduced to &lt;50% and subsequently to &lt;0.1% in 1997. The UN and World Bank aim to eliminate its use in 2020. A reasonable recommendation to deal with the millions of homes with Pb-based paint is not to strip it off thus releasing toxic dust and chips to the air and surrounding soil but rather to repaint over it when the paint starts flaking. Lead reduction programs are essential to protect babies and small children who are especially threatened by Pb poisoning if they regularly ingest Pb through drinking water, hand to mouth transfer of contaminated soils, or chewing on flaking paint. Poisoning manifests itself by brain damage that can result in behavioral problems, learning deficits, and lowered IQ. Cadmium: Cd Cadmium is an existential health danger, a known carcinogen. A principal source of the toxin is in rice grown in Cd-rich soils or irrigated with Cd-rich water. A public outcry arose in 2013 in Guangzhou, China, a port city of 14.5 million people, when a report revealed that the rice tested in 8 of 18 samples from local markets had Cd concentrations above China’s national food safety standards. Citizens were upset because of the knowledge that a long-term bioaccumulation of Cd in the body had been linked to chronic kidney disease/failure, the bone diseases osteoporosis and osteomalacia, diabetes, lung disease, impairment, cardiovascular disease, and cancer [ 15 – 17 ]. Rice is a staple food for close to half the world’s population (~3.8 billion people) especially for poor populations in low and low middle income countries and its purity has to be assured. About 90% of the consumption is in Asia, with a rising demand in Africa and Latin America,  regions with a great number of commercially important sea coast cities.  Awareness of the potential problem has resulted in spot checks of rice crops to assure their purity. Scientists are studying how to reduce the bioavailability of Cd in a soil (paddy or not) to growing plants rice grains, by adjusting the pH of the growing medium [ 18 ,  19 ]. Geneticists that have improved micronutrient contents in rice crops and the plant tolerance to pests and herbicides are researching low Cd-accumulating rice cultivars growing in Cd-rich soils. These may reveal a gene that damps Cd uptake. Once identified, genetic engineers can modify receptive rice species that will greatly reduce uptake of soil Cd yet maintain their nutritional values. Cadmium can also access a body by inhaling cigarette smoke from tobacco grown in Cd-rich soils. Arsenic: As Arsenic has been shown to be the cause of chronic and NCDs in many countries with commercially important and high/densely populated port cities, especially in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan, and China. Contaminated drinking water and cooking with untreated or insufficiency treated aquifer water is a principal source of the toxin. The As may develop within an aquifer as conditions change with water drawdown during growing season permitting oxidation and release from a mineral in aquifer rock into the water as either the oxidized chemical species arsenite (As 3+ ) or arsenate (As 5+ ). Both species can be toxic if enough is ingested but the (As 3+ ) form is 60 times more toxic [ 20 ]. The chronic response to As poisoning may be the appearance of lesions as pinkish to tan or skin colored papules and keratosis, an epidermal wart-like growth. Acute afflictions caused by the long-term As bioaccumulation are cancer of the lungs, liver, bladder, or skin [ 12 ,  15 ]. The World Health Organization warned that more than 200 million people are at risk of As poisoning from aquifer water. Water treatment facilities can eliminate this problem if installed, supplied with necessary cadres and chemical supplies, and maintained with a clean water distribution network that reaches all of a population. Mercury: Hg Mercury in food fish is an existing public health threat. Mercury emitted into the atmosphere from industrial sources, especially coal-fired power plants, rains into the oceans where microorganisms in the marine food chain convert it to the very toxic methyl mercury form (CH 3 Hg + ) [ 21 ]. This chemical bioaccumulates in prey of large predator food fish (e.g., king mackerel, swordfish, tuna, tilefish, orange roughy, shark, marlin, and escolar) that further concentrate it to levels that can harm humans that regularly eat them. Shellfish bioaccumulate the toxin as well. Sea coast populations include much fish/shellfish in their diets, especially poorer citizens that count on fish/shellfish for 20% of their protein nourishment and 50% of their calorie intake. Mercury intake can be especially dangerous to pregnant women or women that breast feed their infants because the CH 3 Hg +  can pass to a growing fetus or an infant and cause neural damage. In adults, Hg poisoning can manifest itself as tremors, memory problems, depression, or diminished hearing and vision. Governments recommend how much Hg accumulating fish meat is safe to eat. For example, Canada recommends that pregnant women limit their intake to 150 g/month (5 1/4 oz), youngsters 5–11 years old eat no more than 125 g/month (~4 1/2 oz), and children 1–4 years old eat no more than 75 g/month (~2 1/2 oz). These values vary with the food fish eaten [ 22 ]. Lastly, it should be noted that there is a possible legacy source of heavy metal toxins or other pollutants: buried/hidden toxic wastes. These are disposal sites left by long gone industries in or near long established sea coast (and inner) cities. As urban centers grow to accommodate expanding populations (2.8 billion more people in 2050 than in 2019), perhaps 700 million added to port cities, areas to be urbanized should first be assessed to assure that no buried/hidden toxic waste disposal sites are present that could, over time, release toxins into an inhabited zone and pose a danger to people. If detected, such sites must be cleaned up before habitation is allowed. </Body>

    <Abstact>Emerging social issues have often led to rumors breeding and propagation in social media in China. Public health-related rumors will harm social stability, and such noise negatively affects the quality of disease outbreak detection and prediction. In this chapter, we use the diffusion of Ebola rumors in social media networks as a case study. The topic of rumors is identified based on latent Dirichlet allocation method, and the diffusion process is explored using the space-time methods. By comparing Ebola rumors in the two cities, the chapter explores the relationship between the spread of rumors, user factors, and contents. The results show that: (1) rumors have a self-verification process; (2) rumors have strong aggregation characteristics, and similar rumors in different regions at the same period of time will lead to a synergistic effect; (3) non-authenticated users are more inclined to believe the rumors, while the official users play a major role in stopping rumors as they pay more attention to the fact; (4) the spread and elimination of rumors largely depend on the users who have more followers and friends; and (5) the topics of rumors are closely related to the local event.</Abstact>
    <Body>Introduction In August 2014, the worst Ebola outbreak on record conceded by the World Health Organization had become an international public health emergent event. Communication channels during times of emerging social crises and natural disasters play an important role before, during, and after such events, and social media have become important channels for communications with the advancement of Internet communication technology. However, emerging social issues have often led to rumor breeding and propagation in social media in China. Public health-related rumors will harm social stability, and such noise negatively affects the quality of disease outbreak detection and prediction based on social media. To study the diffusion of social media rumor towards such social events, in this chapter we present a case study of the diffusion of Ebola rumors in social media networks in China along with the outbreak period. This chapter contributes to the literatures as an empirical study to apply social media and volunteered geographic data to understand human behavior and social phenomena. Recently a new source of geographic information has become available through user-generated efforts, enabled by technologies loosely regarded as Web 2.0 (Goodchild  2007 ). Geographic information can now be found in the contents of wikis, blogs, tweets, photos, and many other forms of user-generated content. Goodchild defines this new source of data as volunteered geographic information (VGI), which emphasizes the role of voluntary efforts in producing geographic information, to differentiate with the conventional geographic information production process. Sui ( 2008 ) further pointed out that VGI has transformed the conventional way in how geographic information is created and used so it represents a “wikification” of GIS, which is not simply confined to new ways of data productions but also includes the development of GIS software, hardware, organizations, and people. Already we have witnessed the popularity of VGI has provided many research opportunities for geographers and GIScientists in the digital age. Many studies found out VGI to be a valuable source because of its huge potential to engage citizens and to be a significant, timely, and cost-effective source for geographers’ understanding of the earth (Yang et al.  2016 ). Our study resonates some other recent successful cases using VGI to help disaster relief, such as the provision of useful location-based information to the victims after the 7.0 earthquake in Haiti in 2010 and the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami in 2011 (Zook et al.  2010 ; Yap et al.  2012 ). Literature Review  Social Media and Public Health Social media produce large volumes of real-time information every day. Messages via social media have supported research and analysis in a wide variety of fields, such as crisis analysis (MacEachren et al.  2011 ), detecting opinion events (Maynard et al.  2014 ), assessment of disaster damages (Sakaki et al.  2013 ), strategic environmental assessment (Floris and Zoppi  2015 ), and air pollution (Kay et al.  2014 ), among others. Scholars have also explored how social media information conveyed issues in public health (Hay et al.  2013 ). For example, Windener (Widener and Li  2014 ) used sentiment analysis to explore the prevalence of healthy and unhealthy food in the USA. King et al. ( 2013 ) analyzed the role of social media in informing, debating and influencing opinions in a specific area of health policy. People began to realize that we have an extremely poor knowledge of how the vast majority of infectious diseases spread across spatial scales (Hay et al.  2013 ). The process of understanding starts with records of disease occurrences estimated from the literature (Rogers et al.  2006 ), reports of disease distribution on the web (Brownstein et al.  2008 ), and the trends suggested by GenBank (Benson et al.  2012 ). Together, these could be used to define a definitive extent of the disease (Brady et al.  2012 ) and to populate a database of occurrence locations (i.e., points) where the disease had been reported. For example, Messina et al. ( 2014 ) manually built a comprehensive global database of confirmed human dengue infection in March 2014, consisting of 8309 geo-positioned occurrence. However, it is labor-intensive to keep track of the current trend of infectious diseases and distribution. It should be noted that social media messages are self-reported volunteered information, unlike those from official or government outlets with delayed announcements. Tweets can be used to track and predict the emergence and spread of an epidemic (Achrekar et al.  2011 ; Velardi et al.  2014 ). The spatial pattern of flu risk was dynamically mapped across various spatial and temporal scales by FluMapper (Padmanabhan et al.  2014 ).  Rumor Theory and Social Media Unlike lies, rumors are invalidated news that may include speculation and uncertainty of certain events (Buckner  1965 ). Rumors can be thought as a message or a communication between people about certain events or certain issues of concern that may or may not correspond to the truth (Mullen  1972 ). Rumors not only communicate messages but also emerge a form of interactions among people in a group of individuals when they face the threat of a crisis (Indrawan-Santiago et al.  2014 ; Peterson and Gist  1951 ; Rosnow  1988 ). Social media platforms, such as Twitter and microblog, sometimes spread wrong information or rumor because they are citizen-based non-professional media. However, some information with reliable sources can minimize rumor propagation, suppressing the level of anxiety in the virtual community (Indrawan-Santiago et al.  2014 ; Oh et al.  2010 ; Okada et al.  2014 ; Spiro et al.  2012 ; Starbird et al.  2014 ). The social media messages containing rumors are different from those spreading news (Mendoza et al.  2010 ). Liao and Shi ( 2013 ) also reported the spreading of rumor during a nation-scale scandal using microblog. The Outbreak of Ebola To detect the disease outbreaks, a process was developed by the World Health Organization to action smartly in the big data context (Grein et al.  2000 ; Samaan et al.  2005 ). However, it seemed that this did not work well in West Africa because of the prevailing poverty in the region (Chan  2014 ). In September 2014, the US Center for Disease Control (CDC) predicted that 1.4 million people in Sierra Leone and Liberia would have succumbed to the disease if the epidemic continued its swift spread (Epstein  2014 ). Ebola has been frequently highlighted by newspaper, TV, and social media, after the virus has spread into many countries and has taken a lot of lives in 2014. More than 10 million tweets mentioned the word “Ebola” on Twitter within 20 days from 15 September 2014 in 170 countries (Luckerson  2014 ). Of course, social media has also become new tools for us to analyze and predict how infectious diseases develop and evolve spatially and temporally. Along with the advancement of Internet technology, the spread of messages through social media had become much accelerated, more specific, and more short-lived than before. With constantly emerging social issues to prompt new rumors, the Internet actually provided an incubator for rumors to grow. This is understandable when considering that social media users came from all walks of life and participations in social media were very much unstructured and unorganized. As a results, social media, although not intentionally, nurture and spread rumors (Jin et al.  2014 ). Due to the widespread fear of Ebola and the lack of timely and transparent reporting of Ebola cases to the general public, rumors about Ebola infection possessed the two critical elements of Ebola infection being an important issue and the ambiguity in all news and reports about it. As a result, Ebola infection was widely discussed on social media. Rumors about public health often bring out discontent in a society. Rumors also add unwanted noise in the use of social media information for any analysis or data exploration, creating road blocks to studies of public health issues (Ruths and Pfeffer  2014 ). This chapter uses the social media message regarding the 2014 Ebola infection news discussed by users of social media in China to study how rumors spread via social media. Specifically, this chapter addresses the following questions: What is the rumor diffusion process of Ebola in China (Ningbo and Guangzhou)? What are different topics regarding Ebola from social media in China (Ningbo and Guangzhou)? Who are those influential individuals or organizations involved in discussing the Ebola? What are the diffusion patterns of fear of Ebola? 
 This chapter is organized as the following. Section  2  reviews the research related social media, public health, and rumors. The paper discusses the method used to collect social media information and methods for unsupervised content classification, analysis, and the trends detection in Sect.  3 . The following section summarizes the analysis and findings on the unique characteristics of how rumors spread in social media. Finally, we suggest future directions for additional research on this topic.  Method In this article, we are interested in the outbreak of microblogging spatial patterns and variation-related rumors. We collected geotagged-Sina microblogging data, classified by topics using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model (Blei et al.  2003 ) and analyzed by exploratory spatial data analysis.  Data Collection Sina Weibo is the largest social network in China. By December 2013, the number of Weibo monthly active users reached 129.1 million, and daily active users reached 61.4 million. The posts in Sina Weibo reached the number of more than 2.8 billion in December, 2013. Sina Weibo provides developers with APIs (application programming interface) to facilitate users to extend application in Weibo. A limited sample of Sina Weibo can be collected through the official API. However, this will pose significant limitations on the detail of microblogs and the amount of data. Because web pages are unstructured, most crawlers are based on the simple definitions of the scope of web pages, which are subject to efficiency analysis (Plachouras et al.  2014 ). We then use a hybrid method, by integrating the API with a web crawler developed by our own to harvest the experimental data used in this study. In mid-October 2014, a rumor was spread on the Internet (Sohu  2014 ) about China’s first Ebola-infected patient who was found in Ningbo, a coastal city in southeast China. This rumor also claimed the mortality rate of Ebola disease to be more than 90%. Almost in the same time, similar rumors about Ebola emerged in Guangzhou, another coastal city situated at the Pearl River delta (Xinhuanet  2014 ). Given the similarity of the characteristic of these two cities, we take the rumors in Ningbo and Guangzhou as our research objects. Considering the rumors may have some pre-warning stage, we began collecting data from the first day of October, 2014. To capture a full cycle of rumor diffusion process, we set the duration of our data collection as 60 days. Previous study indicated that original posts on social media tend to have higher and more significant correlations than its retweets (Aslam et al.  2014 ); we thus solely collected original posts on Sina Weibo. After data cleaning and formatting, we obtained 1163 original microblogs about “Ningbo Ebola” and 1944 about “Guangzhou Ebola” in October and November 2014. LDA  Text in each microblog contains the sentiment of user on Ebola rumors in different aspects. We use LDA model to classify the microblog content in order to explore topics which the rumors involved. LDA is an unsupervised machine learning techniques, used to identify the underlying topics from large-scale document collection and corpus, which has been already widely used for information extraction from tweets (Mehrotra et al.  2013 ). LDA (Blei et al.  2003 ) is a widely used topic model based on the probabilistic theory. In this model, documents are composed of a series of random latent topics represented by the distribution of words. It has been used to automatically generate expertise profiles of online community (Liu et al.  2014 ), to quantify the distribution of probes between subcellular locations (Coelho et al.  2010 ), to mine opinion (Pang and Lee  2008 ), and to assign the annotation of large satellite images (Lienou et al.  2010 ). First, we extract the microblog content from our processed dataset. After that the common stop words (such as “Ebola,” because too often in the text sample, the keyword appears frequently) was removed. Then we consider a microblog as a document, using Gibbs sampling as the realization of LDA to carry topic extraction. There are two probabilistic parameters, α and β, describing the topic distribution. α represents the probabilities of topic distributions of per-document, and β is the probabilities of word distributions of per-topic. Recent years have witnessed significant interest in exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) techniques and application, such as crime (Grubesic and Mack  2008 ), regional economics (Ye and Carroll  2011 ; Ye and Rey  2013 ), transportation (Whalen et al.  2013 ), environment (Xie et al.  2012 ,  2013 ), and public health (Milinovich et al.  2014 ). ESDA should be considered as a descriptive step before suggesting dynamic factors to explain the spatial patterns under study and before estimating and testing more sophisticated regression models (Anselin  2004 ). ESDA can help detect the spatiotemporal complexity towards forming novel research questions. Through deriving related Weibo information through LDA , we conduct ESDA to explore spatial, temporal, and user distribution of Ebola rumors.  Analysis and Interpretation Ningbo is a seaport city in Zhejiang province in East China. Guangzhou is the largest city in South China and is the capital of Guangdong Province. In mid-October 2014, a rumor was spread on the Internet (Sohu  2014 ) saying China’s first Ebola-infected patient was found in Ningbo. This rumor also claimed the mortality rate of Ebola disease to be more than 90%. Almost in the same time, similar rumors about Ebola emerged in Guangzhou (Xinhuanet  2014 ) (Fig.  7.1 ). The fear of infectious disease such as dengue and SARS was the root for rumor to disperse among the mass media. It is also the case for Ebola. We notice that the first microblog that mentioned Ebola was posted in 13 October 2014. “Now the Ebola virus is very scary. There are a lot of Africans in Ningbo as well. Are they carrying the Ebola here?” Fig. 7.1 
Rumor diffusion process of Ebola in Ningbo and Guangzhou 
 Our analysis shows that the rumor officially started on the night of 16 October 2014. A microblog post claimed that: “Is Ebola in China now? I am flying Taipei from Ningbo and the flight was held back for sanitation check. Someone on the plane appears to have Ebola symptom.” Out of the attention and fear of Ebola, this microblog was reposted 181 times in a short while. The former rumor microblog drew the attention from official department in Ningbo city. In the midnight of 17 October 2014, an official Weibo account named “Ningbo Health” was created. “There is a passenger from Nigeria who travelled from Taiwan to Ningbo on October 16th. He was diagnosed with certain fever symptoms. He is still under observation in a hospital.” This microblog was then reposted by more than 2000 other Sina Weibo users. Shortly after this official microblog, another official channel “Ningbo Announcement” posted a similar microblog and reposted the previous one from “Ningbo Health.” Eight hours after its initial announcement, “Ningbo Health” posted a follow-up microblog to clarify the Ebola rumor. “Update: the foreigner from Nigeria observed in the hospital who was detected slight fever yesterday has resumed to normal temperature now.” Three hundred seventy-nine Sina Weibo users forwarded this post. “Ningbo Announcement” also reposted the update microblog from “Ningbo Health” to clear the rumor. It restated that there is no clarified Ebola case in Ningbo city and advised people not to disperse and make up rumor on this event. On 21 October 2014, another similar rumor was dispersed in Sina Weibo: “the first case about Ebola was discovered in Ningbo. This disease has a mortality rate of more than 90%.” Rumor about Ebola was found in Guangzhou city 1 month before its emergence in Ningbo. On 10 September 2014, a post was spread on Sina Weibo. “By eating Salmon you will get infected with Ebola.” Ever since the salmon rumor, there are occasional microblogs claiming that Ebola has emerged in Guangzhou. The Ebola rumors about Guangzhou first spread from WeChat (MicroMsg), a popular instant message tools, on the night, 17 October 2014. In a few hours later, some people sent a Weibo to request for clarifying. Similar to the official channel in Ningbo, an official channel “Sina Guangdong” got involved in the incident and stepped out to clarify this rumor. “According to Health Department of Guangdong Province, there is no Ebola case in Guangdong province so far.” This clarification is against a previous rumor on Sina Weibo claiming that “a case of Ebola was identified in Canton fair. This patient is from Nigeria and he was sent to hospital for isolation.” On 19 October, “Sina Guangdong” clarified against the previous rumor again. As a transitional society, China is sensitive to many pressing issues, such as economic inequality, housing, food safety, and environmental pollution. Through forwarding and commenting negative news, people express their complaints to the virtual space, which easily lead to a variety of rumors. Topics Regarding Ebola from Social Media The content of microblog is often the description of certain event as well as a channel to disclose user’s sentiment. In order to capture a comprehensive knowledge on what has been discussing on Sina Weibo, we used topic modeling method to dig out the topics among these Ebola-relevant microblogs. We treated each microblog as a document and classified them in different topics. To extract the topics in Ningbo, we first delete the redundant microblogs as well as remove our thematic keyword “Ebola” and system keyword “Weibo.” After the data preprocess of 1163 microblogs, we have 903 microblogs to run the LDA using the parameters (alpha = 2.5, beta = 0.01, and 1000 iteration) (Blei et al.  2003 ; Porteous et al.  2008 ). After generalization we have four topics (Table  7.1 ). The first category of topic captures the source of the rumor. It contains keywords such as “Nigeria,” “men,” “hospital,” “fever,” and “immigration.” This also suggested that people know where Ebola might have come from or where Ebola infection was the most severe. Our second category of topic shows people fear towards Ebola. For example, keywords such as “intensive,” “worry,” “China,” “prevention,” and “aware” are related to the high populated area which is regarded more vulnerable to infectious disease. It also suggests that people were more concerned about their immediate environment and their own well-being and people were conscious about what to do to prevent contracting the Ebola virus. In the third category of topic, we notice there are some keywords that show the negativity, such as “eliminate,” “already,” “no,” “epidemic,” “scare,” etc. This gives a negative answer to whether Ebola has been emerging in China. The fourth category presents a global attention to Ebola. This includes keywords “virus,” “spread,” “attention,” “US,” and “clarify”. The global spread of Ebola disease strengthens the fear of Ebola at regional and local areas, leveraging the root for rumor dispersion. Table 7.1 Topics in Ningbo

 After the data preprocess, we have 1503 microblogs to run the LDA using the same parameters as Ningbo. Five topics are identified in Guangzhou Weibo messages (Table  7.2 ). Table 7.2 Topics in Guangzhou

 The first topic reflects the masses’ fear towards Ebola. The keywords “black,” “China,” and “affected” show that due to the fact of large number African people living in Guangzhou, people tend to relate it to Ebola as it was outbreak in West Africa. We notice the process of rumor clarification in the second topic. The keyword “news” shows a traditional channel to clear rumor, and “share” is how microblog got spread. “First case,” “clarify,” “official,” and “rumor” show message from official source is crucial in clarification a rumor. The third topic shows how virus was detected and prevented. “Virus,” “detect,” “disease,” and “related suggestion” indicate that detection and prevention towards virus are still the key process of public health. Topic 4 relates to China Import and Export Fair which is held every spring and autumn in Guangzhou. This event is a famous and top fair for overseas trade, attracting many international buyers and sellers. This represents general public’s concern of Ebola on Import and Export Fair. Topic 5 describes the issue of salmon. Salmon eaters in China have been frightened by titles of the popular articles in the social media like Weibo and WeChat as “China has stopped the import of a whole Norwegian salmon,” “People are likely to get Ebola from eating salmon,” and “Salmon carry with them the Ebola virus” in September 2014. By comparing topics from Ebola rumors in Guangzhou and Ningbo, we notice two similar topics: fear towards Ebola and the clarification of rumor. Fear towards Ebola is the foundation of rumor, while the clarification of rumor terminates the rumor dispersion process. There are different perspectives of two rumor events. First of all, the source of rumor is different. Rumor in Ningbo started from a scam microblog while rumor in Guangzhou was initially communicated in WeChat. Secondly, due to the fact that a large number of Africans are living in Guangzhou, there is delusion from some people that Ebola is close to them in Guangzhou. That explains people in Guangzhou pay more attention to the topic on detection and prevention of infectious disease. In addition, in the same period, an import and export fair was held in Guangzhou, and this brings in several businessmen from African. Again, people in Guangzhou show great speculation on whether the fair is related to Ebola. Last but not least, a rumor about eating salmon will lead to Ebola was pushing the rumor in Guangzhou as well. In a word, Guangzhou being a city in an economically prosperous region has more opportunity for being exposed to Western culture/influences. In Ningbo, the Ebola rumor is an accident breakout wherein a passenger from Nigeria was sent to a hospital in airport. We summarize the post number of each Weibo user, and the result is presented in Table  7.3 . As we can see, most users (1089) contributed just one post during the rumor process. The maximum number of posts a user publishes is six. All users who contribute more than four posts are individual type of users. This indicates that in the process of special event, official channel tends to be cautious. Table 7.3 The post numbers of users in Ningbo
 Posts Users 1 1089 2 31 3 2 4 3 6 1 
 Statistics on user post number in Guangzhou shows similar pattern except that there are more people who publish large number of microblogs (Table  7.4 ). This is due to the fact that Guangzhou has large population than Ningbo and also the mass media in Guangzhou is more active. Table 7.4 The post numbers of users in Guangzhou
 Posts Users 1 1426 2 121 3 26 4 9 5 9 6 4 7 2 8 1 11 2 
 Study of reposts shows that a total of 233 posts have been forwarded or reposted. The top five users that receive reposts are official channels from the local government. This indicates the trustiness from local citizens on their government (Tables  7.5  and  7.6 ). Table 7.5 Top five reposted users in Ningbo

 Similar to Ningbo, the top five users that have been reposted are official users. This again shows the authority of official account on Sina Weibo. Users Asked for Clarification In Ningbo, five users asked for verification from seven official accounts: two police accounts, two news accounts, two other government accounts, and one Weibo company account. Because the rumor in Guangzhou did not originate in Weibo, not many verification requests were identified in Weibo. The main verification is on the report from Zhujiang News. Users Spread the Rumor In Ningbo, 455 Weibo messages were rumor. Four hundred forty-five users (68 certified users) were involved. Thirty-one Weibo messages and 31 users (11 certified users) spread the rumor in Guangzhou. In both cities, most common users (uncertified users) form the main user group in spreading the rumor. Users Helping the Official Source Confirm the Accurate Information In Ningbo, 233 Weibo messages confirmed the accurate information. Among 229 users involved, there were 59 official accounts, 46 certified accounts, and 124 uncertified accounts. In Guangzhou, 194 Weibo messages confirmed the accurate information. Among 180 users involved, there were 52 official accounts, 94 certified accounts, and 34 uncertified accounts. In both cities, common users (uncertified users) are minority on helping the official source confirm the accurate information.  User and Levels of Postings To explore the relationship between user characteristics and message repost, we present the scatter plot involving followers and repost (Fig.  7.2 ). Ningbo and Guangzhou have similar patterns: more followers, more reposts. Fig. 7.2 Repost and followers ( a ) in Ningbo, ( b ) in Guangzhou 
 At the same time, we examine the relationship between number of friends and number of message reposts. Both cities witnessed the similar patterns again. As (Rapoport and Rebhun  1952 ) argued, a higher degree of connection in friendship will facilitate the spread of rumor (Fig.  7.3 ). Fig. 7.3 Reposts and friends ( a ) in Ningbo, ( b ) in Guangzhou 
 Diffusion Patterns of Fear of Ebola in Space and Time  Trend in Time 
 By days 
 By plotting the number of microblogs related to Ebola by days, we can track the temporal trend of the evolvement of rumor process. Figure  7.4.  (a) presents that from the rumor time 16 October, the number of microblogs started to surge, and there are two peaks in Ningbo’s rumor. One indicates the fear to Ebola and another one corresponds to the prevalence of rumor. Fig. 7.4. Trend of two months ( a ) in Ningbo, ( b ) in Guangzhou 
 Figure  7.4. b shows that there is one peak in terms of the number of microblog posts in Guangzhou by each date. This is majorly due to the “salmon” rumor related to Ebola. Another find is that the temporal peak of both cities appears to be in the same period, indicating that the same topic of rumor correlates in time 2. By hours 
 By plotting the time of each Ebola microblog of two cities in 24 h every day, we can see the temporal trend of Guangzhou and Ningbo corresponds well to the masses’ daily activities (Fig.  7.5 ). Fig. 7.5 Trend of a day ( a ) in Ningbo, ( b ) in Guangzhou 
  Trend in Space The source of Ebola rumor in Ningbo originated from the Nigerian passenger who traveled to Ningbo international airport while the rumor in Guangzhou came from the local WeChat community with no further source. We then use geographic information system to map each microblog according to its location in order to explore the trend of rumor in space. Distribution by locations 
 Figure  7.6  shows the geographic distribution of related microblog messages in China. As we can see, rumors about Ningbo’s Ebola rumor were scattered beyond Zhejiang province. However, users who got involved in Guangzhou’s Ebola rumor were mostly from Guangdong Province. Fig. 7.6 The locations of Weibo related to ( a ) Ningbo, ( b ) Guangzhou 
 In order to further test the spatial cluster, we use Average Nearest Neighbor (Wong and Lee  2005 ) to test the degree of spatial cluster of points. The results show that the score of nearest neighbor ratios of users’ location on Ningbo rumor is 0.2932 while the score of Guangzhou users is 0.4526. These numbers are less than the expect value 1, which indicates both point patterns appear to be cluster in space. By standardizing the two scores using Z-score, with Ningbo’s Z-score being −10.1524 while Z-score in Guangzhou being −18.6868, both cities’ NNR results are statistically significant. 
 2. Distribution by profile 
 Users’ profile can be used to identify a coarse spatial location (Hecht et al.  2011 ). In this study, we classify user location by province. In the Ningbo case, Zhejiang (where Ningbo is located) has the most users, followed by Beijing and Guangdong which also witnessed quite a few users. Regarding the Guangzhou case (where Guangdong is located), most users are identified in Guangdong, followed by Zhejiang. The rumors in these two places seem to be locally associated and also related to each other due to the same theme. Discussion and Conclusion During emergencies such as natural disasters or disease outbreak, it is often of critical importance to assess impact and response of people and the surrounding environment as an indicator for better evacuation planning and relief operations. Communication channels during times of emerging social crises and natural disasters are critical before, during, and after such events. Our study shows that social media messages are rich in content, which are ideal to capture and reflect a multitude of aspects of attitude, behaviors, and reactions of social media users to a specific topic or event. We thus argue that there is a pressing need to understand social media use during natural disasters and emergent social event from the perspective of social media users and affected citizens. This is also reflected in other study indicating that during a disaster, affected citizens are usually the most valuable sources who are capable of providing information before the public channel and agency. Therefore, it has been widely acknowledged that Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief ( HADR) responders can gain valuable insights and situational awareness by monitoring social media and volunteered geographic information related to the emergent event (that study also examined a set of factors that can explain those uses, such as time of the tweets, the location and characteristics of the users, previous patterns of social media use, and the degree to which the crisis has directly or indirectly affected the users). Therefore, these messages can be used to monitor and track geopolitical and disaster events, support emergency response and coordination, and serve as a measure of public interest or concern about events (Huang and Xiao  2015 ). In conclusion, this study is an exploratory research conducted for the 2014 Ebola season that uses social media as a possible method for identifying trends in fear of Ebola incidence. The specific Ebola rates and trends are not included in this paper because we want to address the rumors spread in social media and not the detection and prediction of the spread of influenza. There is no Ebola patient found in China in the incidence. In terms of temporal dimension, across the two cities that Weibo messages were collected from, Weibo rates and rumor rates both peaked around 23 November 2014, and both peaked on 11 o’clock in 1 day. Though Weibo is not the birthplace of the original rumor, it facilitates its spread because most Weibo users are anonymous. Driven by fear, the rumor spread demonstrates a fast outbreak within very short time period. LDA method illustrates that rumors relate to real events associated with Ebola, which represents the collective efforts in the context of emergency (Peterson and Gist  1951 ; Rosnow  1988 ). In addition, rumors have localized spatial pattern. The advantages to using social media to survey rumor incidence is that it not only would quicken response time for official, but also it would give a various aspects, which will help us to find the sources and reason, about the rumors. When a rumor spreads, it will spread to social network in a few hours or in seconds even. The topics discussed in Weibo about Ebola rumor show us the source of rumor, the event, and focus of people. Although the attributes of social media messages, such as user name, text of post, time, location, as well as the number of followers and being followed, can be collected by crawler and API, age, gender, and race are not available in most social media platforms. Hence, it is difficult to detect who spread rumors from demographic information. According to a report in 2013, about 53% of users are under 23 years old, who might be significantly affected by rumors (Bai  2014 ). In the growing social media platform, millions of people create, share, and exchange information and thoughts. Further research can be investigated in other rumors with various spatiotemporal features. Social media platform can be enhanced through the development of an early warning system predicting the outbreaks of rumor diffusion, which can help prevent the spread of humors. </Body>

    <Body>What is already known about this subject 
 Sickle cell disease affects millions of people worldwide and treatment remains a serious unmet need. Current approved treatments for sickle cell disease do not target the underlying pathophysiology of the disease. Haemoglobin oxygen affinity modulation to inhibit HbS polymerization is a promising and potentially disease‐modifying strategy for treating SCD. 
 What this study adds 
 Once‐daily dosing with voxelotor increases Hb oxygen affinity into a range that may be therapeutic for SCD patients. Voxelotor once‐daily oral dosing demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics with dose‐dependent increases in haemoglobin‐oxygen affinity. Voxelotor was well tolerated with no dose‐limiting toxicities or indications of tissue hypoxia. 
 1 INTRODUCTION Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the β‐chain of  haemoglobin  (Hb) that leads to production of sickle haemoglobin (HbS). 1  When deoxygenated, HbS polymerizes and deforms red blood cells (RBCs) into a sickle shape, leading to permanent cell membrane damage, 1 ,  2 ,  3  painful vaso‐occlusive crisis, end‐organ damage and dysfunction, and early death. 1 ,  3  SCD affects approximately 100 000 people in the United States and millions worldwide. 4 ,  5  Current approved treatments for SCD include  hydroxyurea 
 6  and  L‐glutamine . 7  To date, no drugs have been approved that target the underlying mechanism of SCD. Hydroxyurea is not effective in some patients and has significant safety concerns, including potential embryofetal toxicity and myelosuppression. L‐glutamine, recently approved, demonstrated only a modest effect in prevention of vaso‐occlusive crisis without improvement in haematologic parameters, and does not target the pathophysiologic mechanism of disease. 8 ,  9  Therefore, a chronic preventive treatment remains a serious unmet need. Because oxygenated Hb is a potent inhibitor of HbS polymerization, increasing the proportion of oxygenated HbS may provide a disease‐modifying approach to SCD. 10 ,  11 ,  12  Previous Hb allosteric modifiers such as 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural (5‐HMF), 13  tucaresol, 14 ,  15  and valerosol (BW12C) 16  have been investigated. These agents (tucaresol and valerosol) demonstrated that increasing the Hb‐oxygen affinity at 20–30% Hb modification inhibited RBC sickling  in vitro  and reduced haemolysis in SCD patients without compromising oxygen delivery to tissues. 17 ,  18  However, poor pharmaceutical properties (5‐HMF), 17  lack of specificity, and immunogenicity (tucaresol 18 ) prevented further development. Because a positive pharmacodynamic (PD) effect was observed with 20–30% Hb modification, this target modification is expected to provide therapeutic effect. This also aligns with studies in individuals with compound heterozygosity for HbS and pancellular hereditary persistence of fetal Hb, where 20–30% pancellular fetal Hb conferred significant clinical benefits. 19 
 Voxelotor (previously GBT440) is a first‐in‐class oral therapy developed for the treatment of SCD by modulating the Hb affinity for oxygen. Voxelotor forms a reversible covalent bond with the N‐terminal valine of the α‐chain of Hb, resulting in an allosteric modification of Hb 20  and eliciting an increase in oxygen affinity. 21  Because oxygenated HbS does not polymerize, voxelotor may prevent sickling of RBCs and potentially interrupt the molecular pathogenesis of the disease. Following promising preclinical data, an “umbrella protocol” (GBT440‐001, NCT02285088) for a phase 1/2 study was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), PD, PK‐PD relationship, and effect of voxelotor on cardiovascular parameters at rest and during exercise following single and multiple doses of voxelotor administered to healthy volunteers and SCD patients. Dose selection and dose escalation were pharmacologically guided based on analysis of PD effect among cohorts. Here, we report results of single and multiple doses of voxelotor in healthy volunteers and a single dose in SCD patients. Results of multiple dosing in SCD patients are published elsewhere. 22 
 2 METHODS GBT440‐001 was an integrated phase 1/2, two‐centre, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, three‐part study of voxelotor in healthy volunteers and SCD patients. Part A, a single ascending dose (SAD) design, and part B, a multiple ascending dose (MAD) design, included both healthy volunteers and SCD patients. Part C included only SCD patients. The study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and in conformity with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was compliant with all relevant country‐specific laws and regulations. The study protocol and all other appropriate study‐related information were reviewed and approved by an independent ethics committee. 2.1 Subjects Healthy volunteers aged 18–55 years weighing between 50 kg and 110 kg at screening and SCD patients (HbSS, HbS/β 0  thalassemia, HbS/β +  thalassemia or HbSC) aged 18–60 years weighing &gt;50 kg were included. For SCD patients, Hb genotype was confirmed at screening, and concurrent use of hydroxyurea was allowed if dose was stable for 3 months before entry. Key exclusion criteria for the healthy volunteers included the use of prescription drugs within 4 weeks of first dosing or the use of over‐the‐counter medications (excluding routine vitamins) within 7 days of first dosing. Key exclusion criteria for SCD patients included Hb levels &lt;60 g L −1  or &gt;104 g L −1  or transfusion or hospitalization within 30 days of screening. Full details of the inclusion and exclusion criteria for healthy volunteers and SCD patients are provided in  Table S1 . All subjects provided written informed consent before the commencement of any study‐related procedures. 2.2 Study design and treatment An objective of this study was to demonstrate drug safety at high target percent Hb modification of ~40% (RBC concentration of 675 μg mL −1  or 2 mM) in healthy volunteers, the level at which there was evidence of a compensatory increase in cardiac output with exercise from prior studies with other agents with similar mechanisms. 15  To dose‐escalate safely and effectively, a pharmacologically guided approach was implemented (Figure  1 ). The initial dose of 100 mg was selected based on allometric scaling of animal data to human to provide approximate 15‐fold margin below no‐observed‐adverse‐effect level of a 28‐day rat toxicology study and to be below the anticipated pharmacologically active dose (≤5% Hb modification). Following the initial dose of 100 mg, subsequent doses of voxelotor were administered to target 5%, 10%, 20% and 30% Hb modification. The first MAD dose (300 mg) was initiated as soon as safety was demonstrated in the single dose subjects at ~20% Hb modification (2000 mg). The final MAD dose was targeted at 40% Hb modification. The multiple dose study in SCD patients was initiated following demonstration of safety in healthy volunteers at equivalent percent Hb modification. Figure 1 Study design and dose‐escalation scheme. Stepwise dose‐escalation scheme for healthy volunteers and SCD patients. In each cohort, eight subjects were randomized to receive voxelotor ( n  = 6) or placebo ( n  = 2). Following the first dose, subsequent doses were escalated to reach 5%, 10% and 20% Hb modification. The first MAD cohort started after equivalent Hb modification was achieved in the single‐dose cohort. The maximum target for the MAD cohort was 40% Hb modification. Food effect was evaluated at 400 mg. Single dose in SCD subjects was initiated at 1000 mg, and the data were used to estimate MAD doses at targeted 20% and 30% Hb modification 2.3 Safety Safety and tolerability were monitored at regular intervals from predose to a follow‐up visit (27 days following completion of single doses and 45 days following completion of multiple doses). Safety assessments included physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms, clinical laboratory assessments, incidence of clinical adverse events and concomitant medications. Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results were followed until resolved or stabilized. No formal power calculations were performed. The sample size was based on the desire to obtain adequate safety, tolerability, PK and PD data to achieve the objectives of the study whilst exposing as few subjects as possible to study medication and procedures. 2.3.1 Part A: SAD In each dose cohort, healthy volunteers were randomized to voxelotor ( n  = 6) or placebo ( n  = 2). Two sentinel subjects per cohort were dosed (one randomized to voxelotor and one randomized to placebo). Providing there were no serious or unexplained safety issues, the remainder of the cohort were dosed 48 h later. A minimum of 10 days was allowed between the last dose administered in one cohort and the first dose administered in the next cohort. The starting dose was 100 mg, and subsequent dose escalations for healthy volunteer cohorts were 400, 1000, 2000 and 2800 mg. Six SCD patients were administered a single dose of 1000 mg voxelotor and two patients received placebo following completion of the 1000 mg cohort in healthy volunteers. Voxelotor or placebo was administered orally with at least 240 mL water, after an overnight fast of approximately 8–10 h. The effect of food on PK and PD was assessed in a nonrandomized, crossover design in the cohort of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg voxelotor. Subjects returned to the study centre after a washout period (minimum of 28 days after the first dose of study medication) to receive a second single dose of the same treatment (400 mg voxelotor or placebo) 30 min after the start of a low‐fat breakfast. 2.3.2 Part B: MAD Healthy volunteers in all cohorts were randomized 3:1 to voxelotor or placebo. Three cohorts were enrolled to receive 15 days of treatment with voxelotor doses of 300, 600 and 900 mg once daily or matching placebo. Cohorts were dosed sequentially, with a minimum of 10 days between the last dose of the one cohort and the first dose of the next cohort. 2.4 Pharmacokinetics Serial blood samples were obtained for PK analyses for the determination of voxelotor concentrations in whole blood, plasma and RBCs. Samples were analysed using a validated liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method. Analytical ranges were 10–10 000 ng mL −1  and 5–5000 ng mL −1  for blood and plasma samples, respectively. Percent coefficients of variation (%CV) for lower limit of quantitation for intra‐ and inter‐run was &lt;11.8% for the whole blood method and &lt;6.9% for the plasma method. Concentration of voxelotor in RBC was calculated from 23 :
 RBC Conc = Blood Conc − 1 − Hematocrit * Plasma Conc Hematocrit 
 2.5 Pharmacodynamics Percent Hb modification was determined by measuring the oxygen equilibrium curves (OECs) and changes in Hb‐oxygen affinity using a TCS Hemox Analyzer. Clinical samples collected in sodium citrate vacutainers were kept at 4°C and analysed according to the method previously described 21  to obtain p20 and p50 values (partial pressure of O 2  at which Hb is 20% or 50% saturated with O 2 ). Delta p20 (∆ p20) and delta p50 (∆ p50) values were obtained by subtracting the day −1 from the sample value. 2.6 Haematology and serum erythropoietin Erythrocyte, reticulocyte, white blood cell and platelet counts were determined with a Siemens Advia 2120i (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Surrey, UK). Serum  erythropoietin  (EPO) was measured by a chemiluminescent assay on a Siemens Immulite XPi (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Surrey, UK). 2.7 Exercise testing Exercise testing was performed based on the Young Men's Christian Association submaximal cycle ergometer test protocol. 24  Heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure and pulse oximetry (oxygen saturation) were evaluated. 2.8 Statistical analysis Demographic data were summarized by dose. PK, PD and safety data were summarized by dose and presented as summary statistics. PK parameters, including maximum concentration ( C 
 max ), time to reach maximum concentration ( T 
 max ), area under the concentration–time curve extrapolated to infinity following a single dose (AUC inf ) or over 24‐h dose interval at steady‐state for multiple dosing (AUC 0–24 ) and elimination half‐life ( T 
 1/2 ), were derived using noncompartmental methods with Phoenix ®  WinNonlin ®  Version 6.4 (Certara, Princeton, NJ, USA). p20 and p50 values between doses were compared using Sidak's multiple comparisons tests to measure statistical significance. PK/PD correlations were determined using linear regression. 2.9 Nomenclature of targets and ligands Key protein targets and ligands in this article are hyperlinked to corresponding entries in http://www.guidetopharmacology.org, the common portal for data from the IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY, 25  and are permanently archived in the Concise Guide to PHARMACOLOGY 2017/18. 26 
 3 RESULTS 3.1 Demographics and baseline characteristics A total of 40 healthy volunteers were randomized to receive a single dose of voxelotor (100, 400, 1000, 2000 or 2800 mg;  n  = 6 per group) or placebo ( n  = 2 per group). Six SCD patients received 1000 mg voxelotor and two received placebo. A total of 24 healthy volunteers were randomized to receive multiple doses of voxelotor (300, 600 or 900 mg;  n  = 6 per group) or placebo ( n  = 2 per group; total  n  = 8). The demographics for these subjects are summarized in Table  1 . Mean age and body mass index were similar across the dosing groups. There was no apparent impact of race on any PK or PD parameters of voxelotor. Table 1 Patient baseline and demographic data Part

Five treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAEs; diarrhoea, upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, headache and rash) were reported in &gt;1 healthy volunteer (Table  2 ). Of these, diarrhoea and headache were considered related to study drug. Diarrhoea occurred only at 2800 mg. In SCD patients receiving a single dose of 1000 mg voxelotor, four TEAEs (diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and pain) were reported in &gt;1 SCD patient (Table  3 ). Of these, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting were considered related to study drug. All AEs reported following a single dose of voxelotor in healthy volunteers and SCD patients were grade 1 (mild).

Five TEAEs (abdominal pain, diarrhoea, gastroenteritis, dizziness and headache) were reported in ≥10% of healthy volunteers (Table  4 ). Headache, diarrhoea and abdominal pain were considered related to study drug. Most AEs were grade 1 in subjects receiving voxelotor; all AEs were grade 1 in subjects receiving placebo. Three subjects who received voxelotor experienced grade 2 (moderate) events: one at 300 mg and two at 900 mg. No dose‐limiting toxicities were identified. Two subjects discontinued study drug because of TEAEs; one subject receiving 600 mg discontinued on Day 12 because of a grade 1 rash and one subject receiving 900 mg discontinued on Day 7 because of a grade 2 headache along with grade 1 diarrhoea and abdominal pain. The rash was a typical and uncomplicated maculopapular rash. These events resolved without treatment except for headache, which was treated with  paracetamol .

A theoretical concern with Hb‐oxygen affinity modifiers is that they could reduce tissue oxygen delivery per unit volume of blood, resulting in a compensatory increase in EPO with subsequent reticulocytosis, increased RBC mass and increased cardiac output under conditions of exercise stress. 18 ,  27  To evaluate this concern, several specific assessments were performed including evaluation of reticulocyte counts, EPO levels and haemodynamic response to submaximal exercise testing. After multiple doses in healthy volunteers up to 900 mg daily, which achieved approximately 40% Hb modification, there was no evidence of a treatment‐related increase in reticulocyte count or Hb level, EPO remained in the normal range (Figure  2 ), and there was no increase in resting or peak exercise heart rate (data not shown). Figure 2 Hb, reticulocyte count, and EPO levels following 900 mg voxelotor once daily for 15 days in healthy volunteers. Hb, reticulocyte count, and EPO values in healthy volunteers at predose, Day 15, and follow‐up (~45 days after the last dose). Data are shown as mean ± standard deviation 3.3 Pharmacokinetics RBC and plasma concentration–time profiles of voxelotor following single dose (100–2800 mg) and multiple doses (300–900 mg), Day 15, in healthy volunteers are presented in Figure  3 . Comparison of RBC concentration–time profiles between healthy volunteers and SCD patients following 1000 mg are shown in Figure  4 . PK parameters are summarized in Table  5 . Following single dose administration to healthy volunteers, voxelotor was rapidly absorbed into the plasma with median  T 
 max  &lt; 4 h at doses &lt;2000 mg. At 2800 mg,  T 
 max  occurred later (7 h), likely because of continuing absorption of high drug load. Later  T 
 max  was observed in RBC (17–24 h).  C 
 max  and AUC of RBC and plasma increased proportionally with voxelotor dose for single or multiple doses. The exposure of voxelotor at steady‐state accumulated as predicted based on the single‐dose data. Following a daily dose of voxelotor at 300, 600 and 900 mg for 15 days, at steady state, the respective mean RBC  C 
 max  were 225, 462 and 688 μg mL −1  and RBC AUC (0–24)  were 4950, 9610 and 14 000 μg*h mL −1 . The accumulation was approximately six‐fold from that of Day 1 exposure.  T 
 1/2  of voxelotor ranged from 61 to 85 h. Plasma concentration declined in parallel to RBC concentration. Voxelotor had high specific binding to RBC as evidenced by the RBC/plasma ratio ranging from 67:1 to 111:1. Inter‐subject variability for  C 
 max  and AUC values was low at doses ≤1000 mg for both single (%CV ≤ 22%) and multiple dosing at steady‐state (%CV ≤ 15%). However, at 2000 and 2800 mg, the %CV for  C 
 max  was 22–36% and for AUC was approximately 28% for both doses. The higher inter‐subject variability at 2000 and 2800 mg was likely caused by variability in dissolution of voxelotor in the gut of individual subjects at high drug loads due to its low solubility (~43 μg mL −1  in simulated intestinal fluid). At the same 1000 mg single dose, inter‐subject variability for  C 
 max  and AUC of SCD patients (30–33%) was higher than that in healthy volunteers (10–17%), possibly due to the higher variability in the hematocrit values (0.20–0.28) of SCD patients compared to healthy volunteers (0.40–0.45). Figure 3 RBC and plasma voxelotor concentration–time profiles after single and multiple doses in healthy volunteers. Healthy volunteers ( n  = 6/cohort) received single dose of voxelotor at 100, 400, 1000, 2000 and 2800 mg. Concentration–time profiles in RBC (A) and plasma (B) show linear increase in exposure across these doses. Following daily dose at 300, 600 and 900 mg voxelotor for 15 days, RBC (C) and plasma (D) profiles on Day 15 also proportionally increase. Data are shown as mean ± standard deviation Figure 4 RBC concentration–time profiles of voxelotor following 1000‐mg single dose in healthy volunteers and SCD patients.

 max  of 2 h and  C 
 max  of 2.9 μg mL −1 . In RBCs, median  T 
 max  of voxelotor was 14 h and  C 
 max  was 146 μg mL −1 . The AUC ratio in RBCs over plasma was 75:1. Terminal  T 
 1/2  was 50 h. This long  T 
 1/2  suggests suitability for once‐daily dosing. The effect of food on the PK of voxelotor was evaluated by comparing exposure following a 400 mg single dose under fasted  vs . fed (low‐fat breakfast) conditions. The absorption rate and exposure were similar under these two conditions. The  T 
 max ,  C 
 max  and AUC inf  in RBCs under fasted conditions were 24 h, 77.3 μg mL −1  and 8080 μg*h mL −1 , respectively; and under fed conditions were 10 h, 74.4 μg mL −1  and 8690 μg*h mL −1 , respectively. Relative bioavailability of voxelotor under fed condition was 108% (90% confidence interval = 100.73%, 115.82%) compared with the fasted condition, indicating that a low‐fat breakfast had no significant effect on voxelotor exposure. 3.4 Pharmacodynamics Blood samples collected from volunteers at various timepoints during both SAD and MAD studies were used to determine changes in Hb‐oxygen affinity via OEC measurement. As the dose increased, both the p20 and p50 values decreased indicating an increase in Hb‐oxygen affinity (Table  6 ). Figure  5 A shows representative OECs at 24 h for the three MAD cohorts following the dose on Day 15. Following daily dosing of placebo, 300, 600 and 900 mg voxelotor for 15 days, the mean p50s and p20s were 30.7, 29.9, 24.3 and 24.6 mm Hg and 16.2, 14.1, 9.4 and 6.3 mm Hg, respectively. A summary of the p20 and p50 changes observed at  C 
 min  after 15 days of dosing is shown in Figures  5 B and  5 C. Due to the biphasic nature of the OECs generated by voxelotor, the changes in p20 value compared with Day −1 were more prominent and significant (Figure  5 B) than the changes in p50 value (Figure  5 C), especially at the lowest dose (300 mg) with voxelotor RBC concentrations &lt;0.75 mM (equivalent to &lt;15% Hb modification, Figures  5  and  7 D). Based on a previously established  in vitro  correlation (Figure  S1 , Table  S2 ), percent Hb modification was calculated from the ∆p20 values and are summarized in Table  6 . The mean percent Hb modifications at 24 h following a single dose of 100, 400, 1000, 2000 and 2800 mg voxelotor were 1.4%, 3.4%, 5.9%, 7.9% and 23.6%, respectively. The mean percent Hb modifications following 300, 600 and 900 mg day −1  on Day 15 were 10.9%, 24.1% and 38.3%, respectively.

 min  after 15 days of dosing. A summary of the p20 (B) and p50 (C) values observed in healthy volunteers at  C 
 min  after 15 days of dosing. A dose–dependent decrease in p20 and p50 was observed, showing that increasing levels of drug leads to increased Hb‐oxygen affinities. Sidak's multiple comparisons tests were used to measure statistical significance Following a single dose of 1000 mg voxelotor, SCD patients and healthy volunteers achieved similar maximum percentage Hb modification (Table  6 ). In SCD, because of the anaemia, RBCs tend to have a higher 2,3‐bisphosphoglycerate concentration leading to a lower Hb‐oxygen affinity, and a rightward shifted OEC. Figure  6  shows the OEC for a predosed SCD patient, compared with the 24‐h OEC post 1000 mg voxelotor dose, which exhibits a leftward shifted OEC, trending towards the OEC of a healthy volunteer.

 Figure  7 A illustrates that the percent Hb modification (derived from OECs) is highly correlated ( R

Figure  7 B shows the correlation between ∆p20 and RBC voxelotor concentrations in samples from healthy volunteers. These correlations allow for an estimation of the Hb‐oxygen affinity in future studies when only the RBC voxelotor levels are available. Figure  7 C shows a linear and robust correlation between p20 values and RBC levels of voxelotor ( R 
 2  = 0.65). As expected, the correlation with p50 values is less robust ( R 
 2  = 0.23) (Figure  7 D). However, when data from 0 to 15% Hb modification (derived from OECs) is omitted, the correlation is improved to  R 
 2  = 0.45, indicating that correlations with p50 improve at higher percent Hb modifications. Figure 7 PK/PD correlation in healthy volunteers.

Voxelotor was administered as a single dose at 100, 400, 1000, 2000 and 2800 mg and once daily for 15 days at 300, 600 and 900 mg to healthy volunteers. The dose increments were determined based on emerging tolerability, PK and PD data. PK and PD following a single dose of 1000 mg voxelotor in SCD patients was also reported. PK profiles in plasma and RBCs were monitored to demonstrate voxelotor binding specificity to Hb and concentrations in the target compartment (RBCs). Following oral administration to healthy volunteers, voxelotor was rapidly absorbed into plasma followed by distribution into RBCs as demonstrated by earlier plasma  T 
 max  (2–4 h) than RBC  T 
 max  (16–24 h). Nevertheless, the voxelotor concentration in RBCs reached near  C 
 max  levels within an hour after administration and continued to increase slowly until the  C 
 max  was reached. This observation supports previous  in vitro  data which show that voxelotor has a higher binding affinity for Hb than for plasma proteins. 28  These distribution profiles are consistent across animal species tested. 21  Voxelotor is mainly eliminated by metabolism in humans with &lt;1% of the dose administered excreted unchanged into urine. 29  The  T 
 1/2  of voxelotor (~60 days) is much shorter than the  T 
 1/2  of human RBC, 30  implying its binding to Hb is a reversible process and drug can be released from Hb before being further metabolized. In healthy volunteers, the PK of voxelotor was linear between 100 and 2800 mg. Accumulation of voxelotor was also linear upon multiple dosing. The unique PK properties of voxelotor are critical in binding to high abundance target and achieving the target Hb modification at a reasonable oral dose (e.g., 900 mg day −1  could achieve ~40% Hb modification in healthy volunteers). In addition, the high RBC to plasma partitioning results in relatively low plasma concentrations, thus reducing the risk of dose‐related off‐target toxicities. The high selectivity of voxelotor for Hb with a lack of off‐target safety concerns, together with pharmaceutical properties enabling once daily dosing, represent a significant advance over prior attempts at developing Hb‐modifying agents. 18 ,  31 ,  32  In SCD patients, voxelotor was also rapidly absorbed into plasma following oral administration, then distributed into RBCs. Although SCD patients achieved the same  C 
 max  as healthy volunteers, the AUC and  T 
 1/2  of voxelotor in SCD patients were lower than those observed in healthy volunteers. The mean  T 
 1/2  of voxelotor was 50 h in SCD patients compared with 61–85 h in healthy volunteers. These differences are likely due to lower hematocrit and decreased RBC  T 
 1/2  in SCD patients compared with healthy volunteers. As  C 
 max  levels were similar between SCD patients and healthy volunteers, both exhibited similar percent Hb modifications, indicating the same potency of voxelotor in normal (AA) blood and sickle (SS) blood. Consistent with the  in vitro  findings, 21  OECs of voxelotor in human subjects exhibited a biphasic profile because of the coexistence of Hb species with varying oxygen affinity. Voxelotor exhibited a concentration‐dependent decrease in p20 and p50 values following the various dosing regimens. The biphasic nature of OECs yields differentiable p20 values at clinical voxelotor concentration ranges, while p50 shift was not significant at low voxelotor concentrations but became more prominent at higher voxelotor concentration; i.e., &gt;0.75 mM (equivalent to ~15% Hb modification). In this study, the changes in p20 values at steady state compared with predose level were significant at all three dose levels, whereas p50 showed a shift at 600 and 900 mg but not at the 300 mg dose. Therefore, consistent with the previously established  in vitro  model, p20 is more suitable than p50 in assessing the pharmacologic activity of voxelotor at therapeutic doses and RBC concentrations. There was a linear relationship between ∆p20 measured from samples in this clinical study and percent Hb occupancy. Percent Hb occupancy correlated with percent Hb modification. Therefore, percent Hb occupancy could be utilized as a determinant for the extent of Hb modification in future clinical studies when p20 values are not available. Evaluation of EPO, exercise testing and haematologic parameters was consistent with maintenance of normal oxygen delivery during rest and exercise up to the exposures achieved in this study, indicating that the percent Hb modification achieved in this study did not impair the ability of Hb to deliver oxygen to tissues. In this first‐in‐human study, the highest single dose studied in SCD patients (1000 mg) and healthy volunteers (2800 mg) was well tolerated, as was a 15‐day course of 900 mg once daily in healthy volunteers and established proof of mechanism on increasing Hb‐oxygen affinity. Voxelotor PK was linear and predictable across the dose range tested. The drug showed a high binding specificity for Hb, and demonstrated a long half‐life, allowing sustained PD effect with once‐daily dosing.

    <Body>1 What is already known about this subject 
 Long‐term adherence to statin treatment is low and discontinuation rates are high. Guidelines for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention increasingly recommend high‐intensity statin therapy. As adverse events rates are likely higher with high‐intensity treatment, this could have a negative effect on adherence rates, but evidence so far is scarce. 
 What this study adds 
 Adherence to statin treatment was higher among patients treated with high‐intensity statins and discontinuation rates were lower compared to moderate intensity. Patients with prior CVD (secondary prevention) had better adherence that those without (primary prevention). 
 1 INTRODUCTION Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. 
 1 
  In Scotland, whilst the mortality from coronary heart disease has been decreasing, treating and preventing CDV remains an important priority in health care, particularly as its population is projected to age considerably over the coming years, with an estimated 25% of the population aged 65 years or older by 2041. 
 2 
 ,  
 3 
  In addition, there is a high prevalence of risk factors associated with heart disease in Scotland, including smoking, poor diet and physical inactivity. Accordingly, in 2015, 15% of adults aged 16 years or above had a cardiovascular condition, which represents an estimated 670 000 people living with CVD in Scotland. Both incidence and prevalence of CVD are higher amongst men, the elderly and in deprived areas. 
 2 
 ,  
 4 
 
 CVD prevention is seen as a cost‐effective strategy in many scenarios. 
 4 
 ,  
 5 
  Evidence from clinical trials and epidemiological studies has shown a strong relationship between high low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LCL‐C) levels and the incidence of CVD; lipid‐lowering therapy is associated with significant reductions in CVD morbidity and mortality. 
 6 
 ,  
 7 
 ,  
 8 
 ,  
 9 
  Consequently, the use of statins, competitively inhibiting  3‐hydroxy‐3‐methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase , is one of the cornerstones of CVD prevention. 
 4 
 ,  
 10 
 ,  
 11 
 
 Recent evidence has supported the higher efficacy of high‐intensity statin therapy in comparison to low or moderate intensity, 
 12 
  therefore the Scottish guidelines now recommend high‐intensity statin therapy, namely  atorvastatin  80 mg, as the most clinically effective and cost‐effective option for secondary prevention in patients with established coronary vascular disease. 
 4 
  Nevertheless, there are concerns around the safety of high‐intensity statins as high doses may increase the incidence of statin‐related side effects such as myopathy, hepatotoxicity or diabetes, 
 13 
 ,  
 14 
 ,  
 15 
  which in turn might impede patients' adherence and persistence to treatment, 
 16 
  and subsequently potentially limit the clinical benefit of statins in reducing CVD. 
 17 
 ,  
 18 
 ,  
 19 
 ,  
 20 
  This is particularly important given that long‐term adherence to statin therapy has already been shown to be far from optimal, 
 21 
 ,  
 22 
 ,  
 23 
 ,  
 24 
 ,  
 25 
  and a significant proportion of patients stop taking their statins within 2 years of initiation. 
 22 
 ,  
 23 
  A wide range of factors, related to both the patient and the healthcare provider, has been shown to impact adherence to long‐term treatment, for instance insufficient understanding of the disease, concerns about side effects or inconsistent information received from healthcare professionals. 
 26 
  There is, however, limited and controversial evidence to date with regard to the effect of statin intensity levels on treatment adherence/persistence. 
 27 
 ,  
 28 
 ,  
 29 
  A recent systematic review of adherence and persistence with statins showed that only two of the 84 studies included reported information on the statin intensity regime and its correlation with adherence. 
 30 
 
 Prescribing and dispensing data drawn from administrative databases is particularly useful for conducting large observational studies aimed at analysing drug utilisation rates, including adherence/persistence to treatment. 
 31 
 ,  
 32 
  The National Health Service (NHS) Scotland, which provides universal health care with no co‐payments for medicines for all residents in Scotland, offers a wide array of routinely collected data suitable for drug utilisation research, including prescribing and dispensing data. 
 33 
 
 The aim of this study was to assess the association of statin therapy intensity with adherence, persistence and discontinuation to/of treatment, thereby covering two distinct phases of medication‐taking behaviour according to the Ascertaining Barriers for Compliance (ABC) taxonomy: implementation and discontinuation. 
 34 
  This information is vital since there has been an increase in prescribing of high‐intensity statins in Scotland in recent years following advice from the Scottish Government and Health Boards. 
 4 
 ,  
 35 
 . The findings from this study will be discussed with key stakeholder groups in Scotland to instigate additional pertinent interventions if needed to further reduce CVD rates. 2 METHODS 2.1 Study design and data sources This retrospective longitudinal cohort study spanned from January 2009 to December 2016, using linked electronic health records for patients registered within NHS Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde (NHS GGC), the largest Health Board in Scotland. NHS GGC covers approximately 1.1 million people, or about 20% of the total Scottish population. 
 36 
  It comprises both urban and rural areas, as well as some of the most deprived areas within Scotland. Although the share of elderly people (over the age of 65 years) is slightly lower than the Scottish average, NHS GGC is in general representative of Scotland overall, particularly with regards to the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases. 
 37 
 ,  
 38 
 
 New statin users were identified using the Prescribing Information System (PIS), which covers all prescriptions dispensed within the community (primary care) setting. PIS data contains information with regards to both prescribing and dispensing (prescribed date and dispensed month/year, prescribed and dispensed quantities, and dispensed item name, strength and formulation), but due to the nature of the database, PIS does not contain information about prescriptions that have been issued but were not dispensed in a community pharmacy. 
 33 
  Data from PIS was linked to the Scottish Morbidity Records Outpatient attendance (SMR00) and Inpatient and Day Care (SMR01) datasets as well as to the Scottish death records using Community Health Index (CHI) numbers. The CHI number is a unique patient identifier used throughout Scotland and incorporated into all NHS Scotland datasets. 
 39 
 
 2.2 Study cohort The study population comprised all adult patients (≥18 years old) who newly initiated statin therapy (atorvastatin,  fluvastatin ,  pravastatin ,  rosuvastatin  or  simvastatin ) between January 2010 and December 2015 (cohort inclusion period); the date of first statin prescription was the index date. New use was defined as having no prescription records for any statin in the year prior to the index date (with the year 2009 used as a run‐in period). Patients were excluded if they used a statin as part of a fixed‐dose combination. In addition, patients were required to have at least 1 year follow‐up time after the index date to ensure sufficient time to evaluate study outcomes. Individual patients were followed from the index date to either death or removal from a Scottish General Practitioner register for other reasons (such as emigration), with the date of emigration/death used as censor date where applicable, or until the study end date (31 December 2016), whichever occurred first. Patients were not censored when being admitted to a care home or hospital, as they are usually provided with medication through primary care or expected to bring their own chronic disease medication, respectively. 2.3 Drug exposure Detailed information about dispensed statin prescriptions was extracted from PIS and included the nonproprietary name, drug formulation, strength, prescription date and dispensed quantity. While the dispensed quantity was used to calculate patients' days of supply, the prescribing dates were used to estimate time periods between prescriptions as these dates are more accurate than the available dispensing dates (which default to the last day of each month). Statin users were stratified into three exposure groups based on the first statin received according to the current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) classifications (high, moderate and low intensity) as detailed in Table  1 . 
 10 
  Only prescriptions for the first statin intensity level issued to patients were taken into consideration when calculating all outcome measures, with patients being allowed to switch between statins within the same level of intensity (eg, simvastatin 20 mg to atorvastatin 10 mg). Results therefore relate to the level of statin used at the index date. TABLE 1 Statin intensity levels according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Statin High intensity Moderate intensity Low intensity Atorvastatin 20‐80 mg 10 mg … Fluvastatin … 80 mg 20‐40 mg Lovastatin … 40 mg 10‐20 mg Pravastatin … 40‐80 mg 10‐20 mg Rosuvastatin 20‐40 mg 5‐10 mg … Simvastatin 80 mg 20‐40 mg 10 mg 2.4 Outcome measures Medication‐taking behaviour consists of three elements: initiation, implementation, and discontinuation. While initiation and discontinuation represent the start and end of drug treatment, respectively, the process of implementation describes the extent to which a patient's medication intake corresponds to what has been prescribed. 
 34 
  Because of the nature of the data available, the outcome measures used in this study covered the latter two elements and comprised adherence, discontinuation and persistence to statin therapy, stratified by the three exposure groups. Discontinuation –  to stop treatment  – was calculated using the refill‐gap method, defined as a gap of more than 60 days without drug supply following the assumed end of a prescription, that is, the last day with assumed medication availability (grace period). Previous oversupply of medicines (eg, due to early refills) was taken into account. 
 32 
  The period of 60 days was chosen based on observed prescribing patterns and the recommendation to have a grace period of at least the average prescription supply, 
 40 
  which was 56 days in this study. Patients were classified as having discontinued treatment when switching to a different level of statin intensity. In addition, to assess permanence of statin discontinuation, patients reinitiating treatment after an initial discontinuation event were identified, and levels of statin intensity prior and after this discontinuation were compared. Persistence –  being on treatment  – was assessed at prespecified points in time (6, 12, 24 and 36 months after treatment initiation) using the anniversary method by assessing whether patients were in possession of drug supply covering specific dates. This method aims to account for both intermediary treatment interruptions and short‐term changes in intensity of therapy (eg, due to temporary shortages of specific drugs). 
 32 
  As patients were not censored when switching between different statins or intensity levels, permanent switch of intensity was classified as nonpersistence. Proportion of days covered (PDC) was used as a proxy for adherence –  to take medication as prescribed.  PDC was calculated by dividing the total number of days covered by statin prescriptions by the total number of days in the follow‐up period, capped at 100%. To calculate days covered, dispensed quantities were used with an assumed intake of one tablet/capsule a day. Applying the most commonly used cut‐off point, patients were classified as adherent when their PDC was ≥80% and nonadherent with a PDC &lt; 80%. 
 31 
 ,  
 41 
  In addition, to be able to better distinguish between implementation and persistence, the compliance rate (CR) was calculated: the number of days covered by statin prescriptions (excluding the days' supply obtained at the last dispensation) divided by the number of days in the period up to, but not including, the last recorded prescription. 
 41 
 
 2.5 Covariables Baseline patient characteristics were captured at index date and included sex, age, first statin prescribed, year of statin initiation, deprivation, comorbidities and overall frailty. Deprivation was measured using the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD), ranked from 1 (most deprived) to 5 (least deprived). 
 42 
  Comorbidities were assessed by calculating a Charlson comorbidity score 
 43 
  using International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD‐10) codes, identified from SMR00 and SMR01 records. The Charlson score is the most widely used indicator of comorbidities and has been adapted by Quan et al for use with ICD‐10 codes. 
 44 
  For the general measure of frailty, the number of in‐hospital days – regardless of cause – was counted during the 2‐year period prior to the index date, as recorded in SMR01. 2.6 Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics were used to assess baseline characteristics. Continuous variables were summarised using means and standard variation, while categorical variables were presented using absolute and relative frequencies. Kaplan‐Meier survival curves were plotted to calculate the median time to first discontinuation of statin use. Associations between adherence/persistence to treatment and statin intensity were assessed using logistic regression models; Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate time to discontinuation. Moderate intensity therapy was chosen as reference based on practical and clinical deliberations. All findings were adjusted for baseline covariables, using complete cases only (ie, excluding patients from the regression analyses when data were missing). All analyses were performed using the full patient cohort, as well as stratified by whether a statin was prescribed for primary or secondary prevention. Secondary prevention was defined as having a diagnosis of myocardial infarction, angina, stroke or ischaemic heart disease – recorded in SMR00/SMR01 – within the year preceding the index date (ICD‐10 codes I20‐I24, I25.0, I25.1, I25.6, I25.8, I25.9, I51.6, I51.7, I60‐I64, G45.0‐G45.3, G45.8, G45.9, H34.1). Sensitivity analyses were performed for discontinuation and persistence using alternative admissible intervals without drug supply (ie, supply gaps) of 30, 90, 120 and 180 days (grace periods). All data analyses were conducted using R Studio, version 3.3.0. For the extraction of PIS data, stored on an SQL server, the R package Open Database Connectivity (RODBC) was used.

  Data were anonymised, hosted and managed by the NHS GGC Safe Haven, and their use was approved by the appropriate Local Privacy Advisory Committee. 2.7 Nomenclature of targets and ligands Key protein targets and ligands in this article are hyperlinked to corresponding entries in  http://www.guidetopharmacology.org , the common portal for data from the IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY. 3 RESULTS During the study period, a total of 212 953 patients received at least one prescription for any statin. Of these, 139 237 patients were excluded due to being below the age of 18 years when initiating treatment, having been treated with statins during the run‐in period, having received fixed dose combinations including statins or not having at least one full year of follow‐up after the index date. This resulted in 73 716 patients subsequently being included in the study (Figure  1 ). FIGURE 1 Study cohort identification flow chart 3.1 Baseline characteristics Of the 73 716 patients included in the study cohort, the majority (88.4%) were initiated on moderate intensity therapy, followed by 9.7% on high intensity and 1.9% on low intensity. Simvastatin was the most commonly prescribed statin, issued to 85.6% of all patients newly initiating treatment and accounting for 95.0% and 79.8% of all moderate and low‐intensity therapy, respectively. In contrast, the vast majority (98.1%) of patients who started high‐intensity treatment received atorvastatin. The mean age of all statin users was 61.4 years (SD 12.6) and 39.5% were elderly (≥ 65 years), with 16.3% being 75 years of age or older. Slightly over half the patients (52.3%) were male. The mean Charlson score was 0.77 (SD 1.32) and 45.2% of patients had hospital admissions in the 2‐year period prior to cohort entry, with an average of 10.4 days (SD 26.1) of in‐hospital stay. There were, however, differences between the three intensity exposure groups. With a mean age of 60.6 years (SD 12.7), patients on high‐intensity therapy were on average younger than those initiating moderate (mean 61.4 years, SD 12.6) or low‐intensity statins (mean 63.9 years, SD 13.3). High‐intensity patients had, nevertheless, more comorbidities, with higher mean Charlson scores, higher proportions of patients with prior CVD (high intensity 25.6%, moderate intensity 13.4%, low intensity 4.8%) and higher proportions of patients with recent admissions to hospital (high intensity 50.3%, moderate intensity 44.7%, low intensity 38.9%). Details of baseline characteristics for the full cohort – overall as well as by statin intensity – can be found in Supporting Information Table  S1 . When stratifying by primary/secondary prevention, patients with prior CVD were older than those without (mean age 63.6 years [SD 14.2]  vs  61.0 years [SD 12.3]), predominantly male (58.9%  vs  51.1% among patients without CVD) and had a higher mean Charlson score (1.72 [SD 1.47]  vs  0.55 [SD 1.17]). In addition, patients with prior CVD had all recently been hospitalised, with an average of 16.5 (SD 30.9) in‐hospital days, in contrast to only 39.5% of patients subject to primary prevention, with an average of 7.6 (SD 23.0) in‐hospital days. Differences between statin intensity levels were also observed in both stratified cohorts (for details, see Table  2 ).

Discontinuation rates as well as time to discontinuation differed between intensity levels, however, ranging from 50.9% with a median time to discontinuation of 911 days (95% CI 843‐1007) among patients treated with high‐intensity statins to 75.5% (median time to discontinuation 207 days (95% CI 168‐244) among low‐intensity patients (see also Supporting Information Figures  S1  and  S2 ). Discontinuation also differed considerably between patients with and without prior CVD, with overall rates of 48.0% and 65.4%, respectively. Similar to the overall cohort, discontinuation rates in both these subgroups were lowest among patients treated with high‐intensity statins and highest among low‐intensity statin patients. Time to discontinuation varied widely between the different patient groups, but was consistently longer for secondary prevention (see Table  3  and Figure  2  for details).

FIGURE 2 Kaplan‐Meier curves of time to first treatment discontinuation by CVD status (type of prevention) After adjusting for baseline patient characteristics (year of treatment initiation, drug prescribed, sex, age category, deprivation (SIMD), Charlson score [0  vs  ≥1], prior CVD yes/no and hospitalisation yes/no), patients on high‐intensity statin therapy were less likely to prematurely discontinue treatment than those on moderate intensity therapy (Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.74, 95% CI 0.69‐0.79). Although Hazard Ratios differed considerably between patients with and without prior CVD, stratified findings were in general similar to those observed in the complete cohort. Compared to moderate intensity, high‐intensity statin patients were less likely to discontinue treatment regardless of prior CVD status (with prior CVD: HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.34‐0.55; without prior CVD: HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.74‐0.86) (Table  3 ). 3.3 Reinitiation of treatment Overall, 72.3% of patients reinitiated statin therapy after a first discontinuation event, the majority of which (72.7%) with the same statin intensity that was used prior to treatment interruption, and 4.7% of patients reduced and 23.2% increased statin intensity. The proportion of patients changing intensity levels differed, however, between patients with and without prior CVD (Figure  3 ). FIGURE 3 Discontinuation and reinitiation of treatment by CVD status (type of prevention) 3.4 Persistence to treatment In line with discontinuation rates, persistence to treatment also varied significantly between statin intensity levels, with considerable differences between patients with and without prior CVD. Persistence declined over time; nevertheless, patients subject to high‐intensity therapy had the highest persistence rates at all analysed time points. Details are presented in Table  4 .

In general, after adjusting for baseline characteristics, patients initiating high‐intensity statins were more likely to still be on treatment at any point in time compared to patients initiating moderate intensity therapy (6 months: Odds Ratio [OR] 1.48, 95% CI 1.30‐1.68; 12 months: OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.37‐1.74; 24 months: OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.29‐1.68). Among patients with prior CVD, the ORs for being persistent with high‐intensity statins as compared to moderate intensity were 3.41 (95% CI 2.24‐5.12) after 6 months, 2.94 (95% CI 1.97‐4.34) after 12 months and 2.82 (95% CI 1.82‐4.34) after 24 months. Although differing in magnitude, the findings paint a similar picture for patients without prior CVD. Patients were more likely to be persistent with high‐intensity statins when compared to moderate intensity (6 months: OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.20‐1.57; 12 months: OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.24‐1.60; 24 months: OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.18‐1.56) (see Table  5  for details).

Based on PDC, the overall adherence rate for the full cohort was 52.6%, but adherence to treatment was significantly higher among high‐intensity statin users, with 63.7% classified as adherent in contrast to 51.6% and 40.5% among moderate‐ and low‐intensity users, respectively. There were also differences in adherence between patients with and without prior CVD, with higher adherence rates among patients subject to secondary prevention at all levels of statin intensity (Table  6 ).

After adjusting for baseline characteristics, compared to moderate intensity, patients on high‐intensity statin therapy in general were more likely to be adherent to treatment, regardless of outcome measurement used (PDC: OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.37‐1.74; CR: OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.11‐1.45). Adherence was similar to the overall results when looking only at patients without prior CVD/primary prevention (PDC: OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.22‐1.58; CR: 1.22, 95% CI 1.06‐1.41), but was considerably higher among patients with prior CVD/secondary prevention (PDC: OR 3.06, 95% CI 2.10‐4.46; CR: 1.98, 95% CI 1.25‐3.08) (Tables  6  and  7 ). 3.6 Sensitivity analyses Results from the sensitivity analyses were consistent with the main analysis, although changing the length of permissible gaps had an impact on absolute numbers of patients discontinuing treatment, as well as on the median time to treatment discontinuation. When allowing for a short gap of 30 days, the overall proportion of patients discontinuing treatment increased to 75.0%, with a median time to discontinuation of 256 days (95% CI 251‐261). In contrast, extending the admissible gap to 90, 120 and 180 days resulted in decreased discontinuation rates of 56.0% (median time to discontinuation 798 days, 95% CI 778‐818), 52.1% (median time to discontinuation 1029 days, 95% CI 1002‐1052) and 47.5% (median time to discontinuation 1409 days, 95% CI 1372‐1445), respectively. In line with these findings, overall persistence rates decreased when shortening the admissible gap and increased when expanding it. Overall trends and differences between patients with or without prior CVD, or between different levels of statin intensity, were not affected (detailed results not shown). 4 DISCUSSION This longitudinal cohort study assessed the impact of statin intensity on all medication‐taking behaviours (adherence, persistence and discontinuation) over a 7‐year period. Unexpectedly, compared to moderate statin intensity, high‐intensity statin therapy was associated with better adherence and persistence to treatment, and lower discontinuation rates. Nevertheless, in line with other published studies which evaluated discontinuation of and persistence to statins,

  discontinuation rates were high overall, persistence to treatment decreased over time, and adherence was in general suboptimal. However, none of these studies assessed the impact of statin intensity. Although differences between intensity levels have previously been reported, albeit to varying degrees depending on the specific population studied (eg, a study conducted in Israel found adherence to be lowest among high‐intensity statin users, 
 27 
  while a Japanese study observed both higher and lower adherence with high‐intensity statin therapy in comparison to moderate intensity depending on the database used), 
 28 
  this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first study to comprehensively analyse all aspects of medication‐taking behaviour (ie, discontinuation, persistence and adherence) with regard to statin therapy, taking into consideration both the level of statin intensity and whether patients have been subject to primary or secondary prevention. Discontinuation was consistently lowest among high‐intensity patients in the full cohort as well as in the subgroups when stratifying by primary/secondary prevention. This is encouraging given the initial concerns that discontinuation rates may be higher among high‐intensity patients due to potentially increased side effects with increased dosage. Interestingly, atorvastatin, which accounted for the vast majority of high‐intensity therapy in our study, has recently been associated with lower odds of discontinuing statin treatment than simvastatin in a study conducted in Australia. 
 25 
  This was despite atorvastatin having been linked with higher levels of adverse events in comparison to simvastatin. 
 47 
  Differences in discontinuation rates were still observed when adjusting for patients' baseline characteristics, potentially indicating that higher intensity statins are either not associated with a significantly higher occurrence of side effects; or that patients are more tolerant towards minor side effects than anticipated if there is sufficient motivation to continue treatment. Unfortunately, adverse events data were not available to confirm these hypotheses. Bearing in mind that a considerable proportion of patients (72.3%) reinitiated treatment after a first discontinuation event, the latter might at least partially explain the results, especially when considering that patients being treated with high‐intensity statins will have a higher risk of serious cardiovascular events and thus might be more receptive to being prescribed a statin, while simultaneously prescribers might be more vigilant with continuing treatment in a high‐risk patient group. Persistence in all treatment groups decreased over time. While 76.8% of all patients were still on treatment after 6 months, this decreased to 69.9% after 1 year, albeit with significant differences between intensity levels, with persistence consistently highest among high‐intensity patients. Similarly, adherence to statin therapy was poor overall, with only just over half of all patients (52.6%) categorised as adherent during the study period; again, high intensity patients generally displayed better adherence. When assessing adherence using CRs instead of the frequently applied PDC, a noticeably higher percentage of patients (overall 69.3%) was considered adherent to treatment. Differences between these two outcome measures were particularly marked within the low‐intensity treatment groups, highlighting the potentially substantial impact of early treatment discontinuation on measurements of adherence. Remarkably, adherence remained higher among patients treated with high‐intensity statins even when using CRs. As in previous studies, both persistence and adherence to treatment (regardless of measurement used) were higher among patients with a recent previous cardiovascular event such as a myocardial infarction or stroke.

 Low adherence to long‐term treatment may be related to a range of parameters involving prescribers, patients, or both, and it is conceivable that factors such as insufficient explanation about the treatment and the impact of noncompliance, an underestimation of disease risks or the probability of drug‐related adverse events (which have all been shown to influence adherence to medication 
 20 
 ,  
 26 
 ,  
 49 
 ) are distributed differently between distinct patient groups, with subsequent effects on outcomes. These factors, however, could not be analysed in this study. Consequently, the reasons for the observed substantial differences in treatment adherence among the study participants remain unclear and need to be investigated further to enhance future adherence rates in Scotland. Keeping the findings of not only this study but also results from other studies in mind, it seems pertinent to consider how best to increase adherence to statin therapy, as statins are a proven and cost‐effective means of preventing cardiovascular diseases, which are, despite recent improvements, still a major cause of death and disability in Scotland. 
 2 
  Interventions to improve adherence that have been suggested include interactive voice response reminders, regular medication reviews by community pharmacists, and repeat disease counselling through nurses or physicians. 
 50 
  Several studies 
 26 
 ,  
 49 
 ,  
 51 
  have highlighted that the patients who were most satisfied with their physician's explanations were more likely to remain current medicines users and to have better adherence. With pharmacists increasingly being introduced into GP practices in Scotland, 
 52 
  there is scope to explore options for improving the dialogue between patients and healthcare professionals, and to potentially implement other interventions tailored to patients that could improve adherence to statins ‐ such as providing verbal and written information about the disease and/or the treatment, adapting treatment regimens or using dispensing support tools such as dosette boxes, depending on context and reasons for nonadherence to therapy. 
 53 
  Most importantly, shared decisions about the initiation of treatment, discussing the potential risks and benefits of statin therapy, and shared management plans are essential to improve adherence rates and quality of medicines use. 
 20 
 ,  
 26 
  We will be discussing the implications of our findings with key stakeholders in Scotland as a basis for debating possible future interventions that could be instigated to improve prescribing and adherence rates. 4.1 Strengths and limitations This is a population‐based study assessing the association of statin intensity with the entire medication‐taking behaviour process, hence providing unprecedented insight into adherence to statin treatment. Considering that access to health care is universal and electronic health records cover the entire population, some confounding factors present in other settings, such as missing out on sections of the population based on incomplete health insurance coverage or inaccessibility of treatment due to copayments, are not present in Scotland. Furthermore, PIS and SMR01 have previously been used for research, and data validity and accuracy have been established. 
 54 
 
 Nevertheless, this study has several limitations. First, study data were obtained from NHS Scotland information systems, which have been implemented for administrative purposes; hence, not all desirable data were available. Details about diagnoses and the indication for drug treatment, for instance, are not available in PIS. Consequently, the indication for the use of statins (ie, primary or secondary prevention) was estimated based on hospital records, potentially affecting the accuracy of findings based on stratification by the presence or absence of prior CVD. In addition, due to the lack of primary care data, the Charlson Comorbidity Index was calculated using hospital discharge records and since some comorbidities might not have been captured, Charlson scores might have been underestimated. Data regarding the number of medications taken by patients, occasionally used as a proxy for comorbidities but also an important factor when assessing adherence in itself, were also not available for analysis, with potential implications for the interpretation of results. Furthermore, data related to clinical or behavioural factors such as lipid control and other potentially confounding lifestyle variables (including smoking habits, diet and physical activity) were unavailable. Consequently, reasons for discontinuation of treatment (which could have been based on a decision made by the prescriber rather than the patient, particularly among low‐risk patients being treated with low or moderate intensity statins) were unknown. Second, the lack of standardised definitions and methods for measuring adherence, discontinuation and persistence could hamper comparison of findings across studies, but this is a well‐recognised issue in drug utilisation research.

  To accommodate the range of admissible gaps used in other studies, we conducted sensitivity analyses. Apart from changes in absolute numbers of patients discontinuing treatment, overall trends and differences between patients with and without prior CVD, or between levels of statin intensity, were not affected. Furthermore, based on applied definitions and calculations, adherence for individual patients could have been underestimated/discontinuation might have been overestimated if they intermittently received statin prescriptions for a different intensity, but the impact on overall findings is likely to be small due to small numbers of observed instances. Finally, an important limitation is the underlying assumption that all dispensed medicines were taken by patients, which is not always the case. Although findings could have been impacted if patients continued to fill in prescriptions despite not actually taking the drugs, this limitation is difficult to address, especially considering the size of the study cohort. As with all observational research, unmeasured confounding cannot be ruled out. 5 CONCLUSIONS The study findings indicate higher long‐term persistence and adherence among high‐intensity statin users compared to moderate intensity, thus not supporting our initial concerns that high‐intensity statin therapy might impede patients' persistence and adherence due to higher risks of side effects. However, the study findings reinforce current beliefs that long‐term persistence and adherence to treatment with statins remain a challenge in the prevention of CVD, as this potentially leads to suboptimal treatment outcomes. Further research, potentially analysing laboratory data in combination with adverse events, is urgently needed to address these issues. Furthermore, steps need to be undertaken to encourage persistence and adherence in Scotland, particularly among patients without prior CVD where statins have been prescribed. We will be following up on this with key stakeholders to plan next steps given the continual high rates of CVD in Scotland. COMPETING INTERESTS There are no competing interests to declare.

    <Body>What is Already Known about this Subject 
 Antiplatelet drugs should be used life‐long to prevent recurrent cardiovascular events after myocardial infarction (MI). Patterns of antiplatelet drug use after myocardial infarction have been studied only for short‐term periods. 
 What this Study Adds 
 This long‐term drug persistence study showed a dynamic pattern of antiplatelet drug use after the first MI, with many discontinuations and restarts during follow‐up. Diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, vitamin K antagonist comedication and calendar period of MI diagnosis were determinants of antiplatelet nonpersistence. Increased attention to the persistent use of antiplatelet drugs is important for lowering the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events.

 Introduction Coronary heart diseases (CHD), particularly myocardial infarction (MI), is responsible for almost 1.8 million deaths annually in Europe. This mortality rate has decreased during the last three decades, owing to improvements in the acute treatment and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Nevertheless, death from CHD still constitutes 20% of all‐cause mortality  4 . Antiplatelet drugs are given as acute treatment for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and as secondary prevention for thrombotic events. Before 2002, only aspirin was used for secondary prevention. Since the publication of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guideline on the management of MI in 2002, aspirin in combination with a P2Y 12 ‐inhibiting drug is recommended for secondary prevention. Aspirin should be used indefinitely, while the P2Y 12 ‐inhibiting drug should be used for up to 1 year after an MI  5 . In the Netherlands, since 2006, the cost of prescriptions of the P2Y 12 ‐inhibiting drug clopidogrel has been reimbursed by the public health‐care system for 1 year after MI. Several studies have been carried out on the use of antiplatelet drugs. The EuroAspire III survey on lifestyle, risk factors and drug use in patients with CHD was conducted in selected areas in 22 countries, and the results showed a relatively wide range of proportions (73.6–98.4%) of patients who used antiplatelet drugs at 6 months after the index CHD  6 . The Antiplatelet Therapy Observational Registry (APTOR) study in ACS patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in several hospitals in 14 European countries reported 32–94% dual antiplatelet drug users at 1 year  7 . Studies on antiplatelet drugs have seldom evaluated the persistence of drug use. The proportions of users reported have usually been based on antiplatelet drug use at a certain point in time, without providing information on the continuous use until that time point. Early discontinuation of antiplatelet drugs after CHD and PCI has been associated with an increased risk of stent thrombosis, recurrent MI, ischaemic stroke and cardiac death  8 . Therefore, persistence with antiplatelet treatment is critical in terms of the clinical outcome of these patients. Furthermore, none of the previous studies have followed the patients for a long period. In the present study, we took episodes of discontinuation into account, followed the patients for much longer (i.e. for a maximum of 10 years) and specifically studied MI patients, in whom the adverse effects of antiplatelet drug discontinuation might be more severe. Information on antiplatelet drug persistence after hospital discharge may be used to improve the secondary prevention of MI, and eventually will improve the outcome of MI patients. The present study aimed to assess the patterns of antiplatelet drug use in MI patients by describing the proportions of persistent users, nonpersistent users and restarters over time. The changes in antiplatelet drug use before and after a recurrent ACS event following the first MI were also reported. As a secondary aim, the study evaluated determinants of nonpersistence with antiplatelet drugs after the first MI. Methods Data source and study population The study cohort for the present retrospective study was recruited from the participants of the Utrecht Cardiovascular Pharmacogenetics (UCP) studies, who were enrolled from the Dutch population‐based Pharmaco‐Morbidity Record Linkage System (PHARMO) database. The PHARMO database links drug dispensing history from a representative sample of Dutch community pharmacies to the national registry of hospital discharge diagnoses. In the UCP studies, patients who had been dispensed an antihypertensive drug (low‐ceiling diuretic, beta‐blocker, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor, calcium antagonist, angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, miscellaneous antihypertensive or combination of antihypertensive agents) and/or had hypercholesterolaemia (dispensed a cholesterol‐lowering drug, or had a total cholesterol level of &gt;5.0 mmol l −1  or self‐reported hypercholesterolaemia) were selected from the PHARMO database. Detailed descriptions on the designs of the UCP studies have been reported previously  9 ,  10 . The UCP studies received ethics approval from the Medical Ethics Committee of the University Medical Center Utrecht, the Netherlands. The present study included UCP patients who had had their first hospitalization for an MI [International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD‐9) code 410] during 1986–2009, been registered in the PHARMO database for at least 1 year before the index MI and were 18 years of age or older. Patients were followed from their hospital discharge for their first MI up to a maximum follow‐up of 10 years, or until the patients left the database, or until 30 July 2010, whichever occurred first. Data collection Data on antiplatelet drug use were obtained from the PHARMO database. This database contains the name of the dispensed drug, Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) code, dispensing date, code of the prescriber, amount of drug dispensed and daily dose. The duration of use of each dispensed drug can be calculated by dividing the number of dispensed drugs by the daily dose. The theoretical end date will be the dispensing date plus the estimated duration of use. Antiplatelet drug episodes were constructed based on the dispensed date and the theoretical end date. When an overlap between two episodes of an antiplatelet drug occurred, the number of overlapping days was added to the duration of the second episode. Persistence and adherence to antiplatelet drug use An MI patient was considered as an antiplatelet drug initiator if the drug was dispensed within 90 days after hospitalization for the first MI. Aspirin (ATC code B01AC06) and clopidogrel (ATC code B01AC04) were considered in the study. We did not include prasugrel or ticagrelor because the former had rarely been used and the latter was not yet commercially available during the study period. The patterns of antiplatelet drug use after the first MI were assessed by classifying the antiplatelet drug initiators into persistent users, nonpersistent users and restarters. An antiplatelet drug initiator was considered a persistent user when the gap between consecutive antiplatelet drug episodes was ≤90 days. Otherwise, the patient was considered a nonpersistent user. An antiplatelet initiator who had a new antiplatelet drug episode after discontinuation of an antiplatelet drug for &gt;90 days was considered a restarter. Patients who restarted an antiplatelet drug could have one or more antiplatelet drug episode(s) after the restart date. These patterns were evaluated for the use of any antiplatelet drug (ATC code B01AC), individual drugs (aspirin or clopidogrel) and dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) (the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel), at 6 months, 1 year and each additional year up to 10 years, or up to 6 years for clopidogrel and DAPT because of the shorter follow‐up associated with these drugs. The pattern of use of clopidogrel was assessed in MI patients who had been discharged since 1998 because the marketing authorization of clopidogrel was issued on 15 July 1998  11 . The pattern of DAPT use was assessed in MI patients who had been discharged since 2002 as the combination was indicated for ACS patients in the 2002 ESC guideline  5 . Adherence was calculated by dividing the sum of the durations of drug episodes by the elapsed time between the start date of the first drug episode and the end date of follow‐up. Determinants of antiplatelet drug nonpersistence Potential determinants that might be associated with antiplatelet drug nonpersistence were evaluated. The factors considered were age, gender, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, vitamin K antagonist (VKA) comedication, bleeding diagnosis during hospitalization, calendar period of MI diagnosis, and history of CAD, heart failure, atrial fibrillation and transient ischaemic attack/ischaemic stroke. Pattern of antiplatelet drug use before and after recurrent ACS Antiplatelet drug use before and after a recurrent ACS event following the first MI was also evaluated. The first recurrence of ACS event was defined as the occurrence of a recurrent MI (ICD‐9 code 410) or unstable angina (ICD‐9 code 411.1) in the year following the first MI; the second recurrence of ACS event was defined as the occurrence of a recurrent MI or unstable angina in the year following the first recurrence of ACS event, and so on. We only looked at the recurrent ACS events in the year following the previous event as CV events mostly occur within this period  8 . The dispensing of antiplatelet prescription in the 90 days before and 90 days after the first MI, and the first, second and third recurrence of ACS events was compared. Statistical analysis The proportions of persistent users, nonpersistent users and restarters were calculated by dividing the number of users and restarters at a certain time point by the number of initiators. These proportions were assessed for the use of any antiplatelet drug, individual antiplatelet drugs and DAPT. Kaplan–Meier curves were used to illustrate the distribution of nonpersistence and restart since the time of discontinuation. A stratified analysis of nonpersistence with any antiplatelet drug, aspirin and clopidogrel was conducted, based on calendar periods of the first MI diagnosis. The periods were ≤2002, 2003–2007 and 2008–2010. These periods were categorized based on the year when the ESC guidelines for MI  5 ,  12 ,  13 ,  14  were published. Adherence to antiplatelet drugs was reported as the average percentage, and the mean differences were analysed using the independent  t ‐test. A stratified analysis of adherence was conducted based on age. Cox regression analysis was used to analyse the association between potential determinants and antiplatelet drug nonpersistence. VKA comedication and a bleeding diagnosis during hospitalization were included as time‐varying variables. The proportions of antiplatelet drug use in the 90 days before and 90 days after an event (the first MI or the recurrent ACS events) were calculated by dividing the number of antiplatelet drug users in that time period by the number of patients who had the event. The differences between the proportions of antiplatelet drug users before and after an event were analysed using McNemar's chi‐square test. The analyses in the present study were conducted using SPSS Statistics 20 (IBM, New York, USA) and R 3.1.3 (the R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) statistical software. A  P ‐value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results A total of 4690 MI patients were included in the study, with a median follow‐up of 5.6 (interquartile range [IQR] 3.3–7.7) years. The baseline characteristics of the patients are shown in Table  1 . The MI patients had an average age of 67.3 ± 11.6 years, most were men (63.7%) and a considerable proportion had a history of hypertension (72.7%) or hypercholesterolaemia (29.6%). 80.7% of patients started on any antiplatelet drug in the 90 days after discharge from hospital but less than a third started on DAPT (i.e. the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel). 11.1% patients had a first recurrence of ACS event over the following year, 20.0% of whom had a second recurrence of ACS event. Later, 28.2% of MI patients who had a second recurrence of ACS event experienced a third recurrence of ACS event. Table 1 Baseline characteristics of patients at their first myocardial infarction

 107 (2.3) a Only for myocardial infarction patients who were discharged after 1998 ( n  = 3761) b Only for myocardial infarction patients who were discharged after 2002 ( n  = 2327) Persistence with antiplatelet drug use Figure  1  shows the proportion of antiplatelet drug users during follow‐up. At the end of the first year, there were still 84.0% persistent users. The proportion of persistent users decreased over time, to 56.2% at 5 years and 32.8% at 10 years. Some of the nonpersistent users restarted antiplatelet drugs some time during the follow‐up, resulting in 89.3% of antiplatelet drug users (combination of persistent users and restarters) at 10 years (Figure  1 A). When the individual antiplatelet drugs were assessed, aspirin showed a similar pattern, starting with 82.6% of persistent users at 6 months, which decreased to 77.3% at 1 year, and the number was reduced further to 27.5% at 10 years. Some of the nonpersistent users restarted aspirin use, and there were 77.1% aspirin users at 10 years (Figure  1 B). Figure 1 The percentages of antiplatelet drug users in myocardial infarction (MI) patients after hospital discharge, stratified as persistent users, nonpersistent users and restarters.

At 6 months, 37.0% of patients discontinued clopidogrel use, and the proportion of persistent users was reduced steeply, to 39.0% at 1 year. Only a small proportion of patients continued using clopidogrel beyond 1 year. At 6 years after MI, 19.6% patients had restarted clopidogrel use, leading to 26.0% overall clopidogrel users (Figure  1 C). DAPT use followed the same pattern as clopidogrel (Figure  1 D). The proportion of DAPT persistent users declined rapidly, from 56.8% at 6 months to 31.5% at 1 year. The DAPT nonpersistent users mostly continued their antiplatelet treatment with aspirin only (the cumulative proportion in 6 years was 23.7%), and a small proportion continued with clopidogrel only (the cumulative proportion in 6 years was 9.6%). The proportion of restarters for DAPT showed a small increase after 5 years. Discontinuations and restarts of antiplatelet drugs after the first MI are also shown as Kaplan–Meier curves ( Figure S1 ). The number of antiplatelet persistent users declined gradually over the years, but around 60% of those who discontinued had restarted again within 1 year after the discontinuation date. Aspirin users showed a similar gradual declining persistence pattern but with a slower increase in restarting after the discontinuation date. The percentage of clopidogrel persistent users declined more rapidly, to 39.0% at 1 year, and less than 40% restarted gradually after the discontinuation date. Around 48% of these restarters had an ACS or PCI in the 90 days before the restart date (data not shown). As expected, DAPT persistent users showed a similar pattern to clopidogrel, with a small proportion restarting after discontinuation. In those who became nonpersistent users within 6 months, 30% experienced a recurrent ACS event within 6 months after the discontinuation date. The median time interval between the discontinuation date and the first recurrence of ACS event in this group was 80 (IQR 34–150) days. In all patients who discontinued antiplatelet drugs, 15.8% of them experienced a first recurrence of ACS during the entire follow‐up, and the median time interval between discontinuation date and the first recurrence of ACS event was 1101 (IQR 163–2236) days. Determinants of antiplatelet drug nonpersistence Stratification of persistent users by the calendar periods of MI diagnosis showed that the probability of antiplatelet discontinuation was significantly different between calendar periods ( P  &lt; 0.05). There was an increase in antiplatelet persistence in patients whose MI diagnosis followed the publication of the updated ESC guidelines on MI in 2002–2003 and 2007–2008 (Figure  2 ). In Table  2 , the corresponding HRs of the calendar periods are presented. VKA comedication (HR values ranged from 2.20 for clopidogrel to 18.97 for any antiplatelet drug) was associated with a higher risk of nonpersistence with any antiplatelet drug, aspirin, clopidogrel and DAPT. By contrast, diabetes (HR ranged from 0.44 to 0.52) and hypercholesterolaemia (HR ranged from 0.45 to 0.49) were both associated with a lower risk of nonpersistence with any antiplatelet drug and aspirin. Nonpersistence with clopidogrel was also associated with age [HR for every 10‐year increase: 0.92; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87, 0.98], diabetes (HR 1.74; 95% CI 1.11, 2.73), hypercholesterolaemia (HR 1.43; 95% CI 1.12, 1.83) and previous CAD (HR 0.83; 95% CI 0.69, 0.98).

Average adherence to any antiplatelet drug was high (86.3 ± 23.9%). Aspirin adherence was almost as high (79.0 ± 30.6%), while the adherence to clopidogrel was lower (38.6 ± 36.1%). The difference between the average adherence to aspirin and to clopidogrel was significant ( P  &lt; 0.01). Patients who were 65 years of age or younger had an average adherence to antiplatelet drug of 89.2%, while those who were older than 65 years had an average of 84.3% ( Figure S3 ). Antiplatelet drug use before and after the first MI and recurrent ACS events In general, there was an increase in antiplatelet drug use in the 90 days after an event compared with the use in the 90 days before the event, with the largest difference for the first MI (Figure  3 ). As expected, the increase in clopidogrel use for recurrent ACS events was larger than that for aspirin. Figure 3 The percentages of antiplatelet drug use in the 90 days before and 90 days after the first myocardial infarction (MI), and the 90 days before and 90 days after the first, second and third recurrence of acute coronary syndrome (rec. ACS). ns, non‐significant. * P  &lt; 0.05, ** P  &lt; 0.01 Discussion Persistence of the use of any antiplatelet drug after hospitalization for the first MI was relatively high in the Netherlands at 1 year. The proportion of persistent users decreased with each additional year following MI after the first year. At 10 years, the proportion of antiplatelet drug users was still fairly high (89.3%), due to a large proportion of restarters. A similar pattern was observed for aspirin. Clopidogrel persistence decreased rapidly in the first year, and the overall proportion of clopidogrel users was 26.0% at 6 years. DAPT and clopidogrel use patterns were similar. Several predictors for nonpersistence with antiplatelet drugs were identified. While the proportion of MI patients who persistently used antiplatelet drugs was relatively high in the first year, it was not optimal. A discontinuation of antiplatelet drugs early after CHD and PCI might lead to a recurrent ACS event  8 . In the present study, the nonpersistent user proportion at 1 year was driven mostly by early discontinuation within 6 months. Indeed, the present study showed that in 30% of the patients who discontinued antiplatelet drugs within 6 months after the first MI, a recurrent ACS occurred within 6 months after the discontinuation date. Early antiplatelet discontinuation might be caused by drug intolerance, major bleeding, invasive procedures, comedications and patient‐related factors  8 ,  15 . The reasons for discontinuation of antiplatelet drugs were not recorded in the present study. The proportion of antiplatelet drug users at 6 months found in the present study was similar to that found in the EuroAspire III survey in the Netherlands  6 . However, the proportion of antiplatelet drug users at 1 year in the present study was higher than that found in the Netherlands Heart Foundation (NHF) study, which reported 58–65% antiplatelet drug use at 1 year after MI hospitalization  16 . This might be caused by differences in the methods used to calculate the number of users. The NHF study reported a point prevalence based on the dispensing of a prescription which period including 1 October each year. Compared with the studies on antiplatelet drug use in other countries, the proportion of persistent antiplatelet drug users in the Netherlands was lower. In a primary care study in the UK, 85% patients were still using aspirin at 1 year after an acute coronary event  17 , as opposed to 77.3% in the Netherlands. Another study in the UK reported a higher proportion of clopidogrel persistent users (53.0–54.0%) at 1 year after MI  18  compared with that in the Netherlands. However, a study in the USA showed a lower proportion of clopidogrel persistent users, with only 31.5% of patients remaining on clopidogrel at 1 year after acute MI or coronary stenting  19 . The high nonpersistence of clopidogrel and DAPT is in line with the results of the clinical trials and long‐term observational studies leading to ESC guideline recommendations on the use of antiplatelet drugs after coronary stenting for ACS  20 ,  21 ,  22 ,  23 . DAPT should be used for at least 1 month after a bare metal stent (BMS) implantation, for at least 6 months after a drug‐eluting stent (DES) implantation and up to a maximum of 1 year, or longer in patients with a high cardiovascular and low bleeding risk, after which monotherapy with aspirin should be continued indefinitely  23 . A previous study in Japan, conducted in patients who underwent coronary revascularization between 2005 and 2007, showed that the percentage of patients using DAPT was 67.3% in those receiving DES  vs . 33.4% in those receiving BMS at 1 year, and 48.7%  vs . 24.3% at 5 years, respectively  24 . However, there is no information available on the type of stent used in the present study. Stratification of calendar periods corresponding with the publication dates of revised guidelines for MI demonstrated that nonpersistence with antiplatelet drugs improved during 2000–2010. The calendar period of MI diagnosis was also shown to be an independent determinant of antiplatelet nonpersistence. Concomitant VKA use was strongly associated with a higher risk of nonpersistence with antiplatelet drugs. This finding was in line with that of a previous study by Rossini  et al ., who showed that the use of an oral anticoagulant was a predictor of discontinuation of aspirin, clopidogrel and DAPT  8 . As the concomitant use of an antiplatelet drug and an oral anticoagulant is associated with bleeding  25 , this combination should be avoided. However, there are indications, such as for those with atrial fibrillation undergoing coronary stenting, in whom the combination is indicated  14 . In any antiplatelet drug users and in aspirin users, diabetes and hypercholesterolaemia were significantly associated with a lower risk of nonpersistence. This was expected as these conditions are associated with a higher risk of recurrent cardiovascular events. In clopidogrel users, diabetes and hypercholesterolaemia were associated with a higher risk of antiplatelet drug nonpersistence. Although this was unexpected, it might be partly explained by the concern of a pharmacokinetic interaction between atorvastatin and clopidogrel in patients with hypercholesterolaemia  26 , and diabetes was reported as a predictor of insufficient antiplatelet response to clopidogrel  27 . Patients with previous CAD, who also have a higher risk for recurrent cardiovascular events, had a lower risk of clopidogrel nonpersistence but a higher risk of DAPT nonpersistence. The latter might have been confounded by bleeding events (major and minor) as we did not include the time‐varying bleeding event variable in the analysis of DAPT use. We did not have information on minor bleeding events, while more severe bleeding events that needed hospitalization were rare, occurring in 1% of patients. The average adherence to any antiplatelet drug and aspirin was relatively high, while clopidogrel adherence was low. A study by Tuppin  et al. 
 28 , in France, showed an approximately similar proportion (81.7%) of adherent users of antiplatelet drugs (aspirin and clopidogrel) to that in our study (78.9%). Another study, in Italy, showed a lower proportion of adherent antiplatelet drug users (58.7%)  29 . The population of MI patients in our study were, on average, younger than that in the Italian study. Younger patients tend to be more adherent to treatment than older patients  28 , as also shown in the present study. However, even the older patients in the present study showed a high adherence to antiplatelet drugs. When considering the results of the present study, some limitations should be taken into account. We included patients who had previous conditions that might have affected the use of antiplatelet drugs – e.g. those with hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, atrial fibrillation, stroke/transient ischaemic attack and bleeding. We do not have information on the reasons for antiplatelet discontinuation, or whether the discontinuation was physician‐ or patient initiated. The persistence of DAPT might be affected by the type of stent used; however, the stent type is not available in the database. Furthermore, the in‐hospital use of drugs dispensed by the hospital pharmacy was not recorded in our database, which might have led to immeasurable time bias. However, as patients were defined as persistent users when the gap between consecutive drug episodes was ≤90 days, it is unlikely that a misclassification of persistent users as nonpersistent users occurred as the length of stay in hospital was rarely more than 90 days. The strengths of the present study were that it had a longer follow‐up compared with the previous studies in this field, and that it considered the proportions of persistent users and restarters as opposed to point prevalence proportions. The data source, the PHARMO dispensing database, contained complete outpatient medication use data for patients still registered in the database. The use of a dispensing database, rather than patient/physician interview or recall, in the study ensured a more reliable source of antiplatelet exposure information. Furthermore, in contrast to other countries, in the Netherlands low‐dose aspirin for CVD secondary prevention is available only on prescription and is reimbursed, so the misclassification of aspirin exposure due to over‐the‐counter dispensing was not an issue in the present study. The choice of a 90‐day gap as the definition of nonpersistence has been used before. This gap is equivalent to the length of a single chronic prescription period in the Netherlands. We showed that there is a need to improve persistence in the use of antiplatelet drugs following MI. There should be more attention to unjustified discontinuation of antiplatelet drugs, particularly if it is initiated by patients. Future research should be directed at monitoring antiplatelet drug use and elucidating the reasons for antiplatelet drug discontinuation, so that interventions can be developed to improve the persistence with antiplatelet drugs. In conclusion, there was a relatively high persistence with any antiplatelet drug early after MI in this long‐term follow‐up study in the Netherlands but this decreased in the years following the MI. Many patients restarted antiplatelet drugs during follow‐up. However, in spite of the restart, it is important to be aware that the gap between discontinuation and restart is a critical period for the occurrence of recurrent CV events. Diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, VKA comedication and calendar period of MI diagnosis were important determinants of antiplatelet nonpersistence. Improvement is still needed in the secondary prevention of MI in the Netherlands.

    <Title>Spotlight Commentary: What's new in lipid‐lowering pharmacology? Integrating basic and clinical research to improve patient outcomes</Title>
    <Doi>10.1111/bcp.14359</Doi>

    <Body>1 Statins have been the mainstay of lipid‐lowering therapy since the 1990s, and many people alive and in good health today have statins to thank for their fortunate situation. The very nature of preventative medicine makes it impossible to know which individuals have benefited, but the numbers speak for themselves. Convincing evidence from a multitude of large‐scale randomized controlled trials demonstrates that statin therapy reduces the risk of major cardiovascular events by approximately one quarter, for each mmol/L reduction in low‐density lipoprotein (LDL), for each year (after the first) for which it is taken. 
 1 
 
 Recent excitement and discussion in the lipid‐lowering field has focused on newer lipid‐lowering agents, particularly inhibitors of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which result in substantially lower LDL‐Cholesterol (LDL‐C) than can be achieved with statin therapy. PCSK9 is an important regulator of hepatic LDL receptors. When PCSK9 is inactivated by monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) (alirocumab and evolocumab) or its production is halted by small interfering RNA (inclisiran), LDL receptors are upregulated, and LDL particles are more effectively cleared from the circulation. This reduces the extent to which LDL‐driven atherosclerosis can develop. Large‐scale clinical trials have demonstrated the benefits of MoAb PCSK9 inhibitors against major cardiovascular events. Encouragingly, recent research suggests that evolocumab has a similar pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects in Caucasian and Asian individuals, suggesting that the drug will be useful across a range of populations. 
 2 
  Nevertheless, the high cost of new pharmacological agents and the extensive long‐term clinical trial evidence for statin therapy means that statins will continue to be the first‐line choice of drug in the vast majority of patients for many years. It is essential, therefore, that researchers continue to investigate these life‐prolonging drugs, to enable them to be used to optimally benefit patients. What is left to discover about a class of drugs which is used extensively throughout the world, and which has been in our therapeutic tool‐box for over thirty years? Quite a lot, as it happens. As ever, pharmacology leads the way in making discoveries which allow us to improve patient care. The centrality of the dose–response relationship to the understanding of how drugs work was for many years emphasized by the inclusion of a stylized characteristic sigmoidal curve (on an implied linear‐log scale) within the logo of the British Pharmacological Society. In preclinical experiments, the biological response to a drug can be carefully characterized across a wide range of concentrations, often in minutes or hours, within model systems. The same is not true for clinical trials which are expensive, and, when they are based on meaningful clinical outcomes, take many years to reveal their answers. In these circumstances, it is rarely feasible to test more than one or two doses of the investigational agent, carefully chosen based upon small dose‐ranging studies and pharmacokinetic modelling. The consequences of choosing the ‘wrong’ dose in clinical trials can be catastrophic: too low, and a potentially therapeutic drug appears ineffective; too high, and the benefits of the drug might be outweighed by toxicity. In a thought‐provoking recent article, Simon Dimmitt and colleagues from the University of Western Australia apply pharmacological principles to clinical data and argue that our current doses of statins are indeed too high. The authors discuss the relevance of ED50 (effective dose 50, the estimated mean population dose necessary to achieve half the maximum possible drug effect, Emax) in dose‐ranging. They point out that in cardiology, drugs are commonly administered at doses which are a few fold higher than their ED50; for example, hydrochlorothiazide is dosed at 2.5× its ED50, with similar ratios for other drugs: amlodipine (5×), metoprolol (3.3×), fenofibrate (1.8×) and clopidogrel (2.5×). Similar ratios are employed with first‐generation statins, for example, simvastatin (0.3–5.3×) and pravastatin (0.25–2×). This is in stark contrast to the newer statins, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, both of which have recommended doses which are up to 40× larger than their ED50 for LDL‐C‐lowering. 
 3 
  The authors persuasively and coherently argue that raising the dose so far above the ED50 predisposes patients to adverse effects without a parallel increase in therapeutic benefit. The reported extent of statin‐associated side effects is probably exaggerated, owing to the ‘Drucebo’ (DRUg + plaCEBO) effect by which well‐publicized side effects are attributed to statin therapy, even when there is unlikely to be a causal relationship. 
 4 
  However, long‐term adherence to statins is poor, and non‐adherence is associated with poor clinical outcomes.

  Should we suggest lower doses of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin in individuals who experience muscle symptoms, on the basis that some statin therapy is better than none? Such an approach is not necessarily backed by high‐quality randomized controlled evidence but is a reasonable approach in light of the arguments made by Dimmitt et al. Interestingly, a meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials found that alternate‐day dosing of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin to be as effective as daily‐dosing in reducing LDL‐C. 
 5 
  The International Lipid Expert Panel (ILEP), a collaborative group of physicians and scientists, has made recommendations for the management of statin intolerance which include reducing the dose of statin to that which can be tolerated by the patient. 
 6 
 
 Variability between patients in the dose of statin which can be tolerated without side effects may reflect inter‐individual differences in drug metabolism. Recently, Turner, Pirmohamed, and colleagues from the University of Liverpool investigated factors affecting plasma concentrations of atorvastatin and its metabolites in 571 patients hospitalized for non‐ST elevation acute coronary syndrome. In addition to confirming existing known factors, they identified smoking (which reduces hydroxylation and increases lactonization of atorvastatin), proton pump inhibitors and loop diuretics, both of which were associated with increased atorvastatin concentrations. Although such effects were small and potentially dependent on the CYP2C19 phenotype, they may be sufficient to precipitate toxicity in some patients on high statin doses. 
 7 
  Their results also highlight the growing importance of considering pharmacogenetics as an aspect of personalized medicine. Cardio‐oncology is an increasingly important field of investigation, as the remarkable increase in cancer survival in recent years raises the question of how to manage cardiovascular risk in individuals who have previously been or are currently being treated for malignancies. This, of course, includes the consideration of drug–drug interactions. Osimertinib is an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of non‐small‐cell lung carcinomas. Based upon its known mechanism of action, theoretical interactions with simvastatin (via CYP3A) and rosuvastatin via (breast cancer resistance protein substrate) have been proposed. Recent phase 1 studies detected no clinically relevant interactions, suggesting that it is safe to use simvastatin (and other CYP3A substrates) and rosuvastatin at the same time as osimertinib. 
 8 
  Intriguingly, statin use may be associated with better outcomes in cancer. A meta‐analysis of observational studies demonstrated that post‐diagnostic statin use was inversely associated with all‐cause mortality HR (95%CI) 0.74 (0.63–0.8). Such interesting findings should provoke both randomized controlled trials (to determine whether a causal relationship exists) and experimental pharmacology (to study any underlying mechanisms). 
 9 
 
 It has long been apparent with respect to LDL‐C that ‘lower is better’. It is increasingly clear that the magnitude of CVD risk reduction derived from lipid‐lowering therapy increases with the duration of therapy; that is, ‘lower is better, for longer’. 
 10 
  Nevertheless, as is the case for many preventative interventions in health care, concern is often expressed that in translating the results of clinical trials and epidemiological studies into guidelines, we are treating the population, rather than the individual patient. It is also important not to extrapolate beyond the limits of good quality data. It is possible that there is a baseline lower limit of LDL‐C required for normal physiological function, although no such limit has been found with current drugs, even at their highest doses. The pharmacological studies briefly described in this commentary all in some way help us to consider a more personalized and patient‐centric approach to lipid‐lowering therapy so that we will be able confidently to say that ‘lower is better, for everybody’.

    <Title>Effects of cladribine tablets on heart rate, atrio‐ventricular conduction and cardiac repolarization in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis</Title>

    <Body>What is already known about this subject 
 Cladribine is a nucleoside analogue of deoxyadenosine, and cladribine tablets were recently approved in Europe and other regions for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS). Cladribine tablets are associated with targeted lymphocyte reduction and durable efficacy. 
 What this study adds 
 This study presents the evaluation of the cardiac safety of cladribine tablets with particular emphasis on the potential QT/QTc risk in patients with RMS. Potential effects of cladribine tablets on the cardiac repolarization were examined by an ECG substudy as part of a Phase III trial (CLARITY) that was combined with a population PK/PD approach. There is no evidence of any cladribine‐related effect on heart rate, atrio‐ventricular conduction or cardiac repolarization. 
 1 INTRODUCTION Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic and debilitating immune‐mediated disorder of the central nervous system, in which B and T cells are believed to play a major pathophysiological role. 1 
 Cladribine tablets 10 mg (MAVENCLAD ® ) were recently approved in Europe 2  and other regions for the treatment of adults with relapsing MS (RMS), and were shown to have significant efficacy for the treatment of RMS in placebo‐controlled Phase III trials. 1 ,  3 ,  4 
 
 Cladribine  is a nucleoside analogue of deoxyadenosine. The cladribine prodrug is phosphorylated intracellularly to its active product, 2‐chlorodeoxyadenosine triphosphate (Cd‐ATP), primarily by deoxycytidine kinase. In most cells this deoxynucleotide product is degraded, by  5’‐nucleotidase . Cells containing a high deoxycytidine kinase to 5′‐nucleotidase activity ratio such as B and T lymphocytes accumulate deoxynucleotides to toxic concentrations, resulting in cell death. By this mechanism, cladribine tablets exert a selective mode of action on B and T lymphocytes. 5 ,  6 
 Assessing the potential for a new drug to affect cardiac ventricular repolarization, thereby causing life‐threatening arrhythmias, is now an integral component of premarketing safety assessment in preclinical and clinical development. The ICH E14 Guideline recommends a “Thorough QT Study” (TQT) as a default approach to assess clinical QT risk. 7  TQT studies aim for careful evaluation of drug effects on ventricular repolarization (i.e. the electrocardiographic QT/QTc interval) at multiples of therapeutic exposure together with a positive control to confirm the sensitivity of the study and methods employed. Yet for some drugs and diseases, including oncology and immunosuppressive drugs, elements of the TQT may be impractical or unethical (e.g. studies in healthy volunteers and administration of supra‐therapeutic doses) due to the potential for posing unacceptable risk to healthy volunteers. 8 ,  9  In these instances, alternative approaches to QT/QTc risk assessment are needed, and must be carefully considered and pursued. This has been acknowledged by the International Conference of Harmonisation and adopted by the European Medicines Agency by a recently issued question and answer (Q&amp;A) document (R3) to the ICH E14 Guideline. 10 
 This article presents the evaluation of potential QT/QTc risk of cladribine in patients with RMS by means of an electrocardiogram (ECG) substudy that was combined with a population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) approach as part of the multinational, multi‐centre CLARITY Phase III trial. 1 
 2 METHODS 2.1 Introduction to the CLARITY trial The CLARITY trial ( ClinicalTrials.gov  number, NCT00213135) was a 96‐week, Phase III, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, multicentre trial which evaluated the safety and efficacy of cladribine tablets 3.5 mg/kg and 5.25 mg/kg body weight (BW; cumulative dose) in patients with relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). The cumulative dose of 3.5 mg/kg consisted of two annual courses of 1.75 mg/kg that each comprised two treatment weeks; one at the start of the first month and one at the start of second month of each year. Each treatment week consisted of 4 or 5 treatment days on which patients received 10 mg or 20 mg (one or two 10 mg tablets) as a single oral daily dose, depending on individual BW. The cumulative dose of 5.25 mg/kg consisted of a further two treatment weeks in the first year in addition to the 3.5 mg/kg dosing schedule. CLARITY involved 1326 patients with a diagnosis of RRMS, according to the McDonald criteria. Patients were recruited from approximately 135 sites, located in, but not limited to, North America, South America, Europe, Russia and Australia. Patients were randomly assigned in an approximate 1:1:1 ratio to receive one of two cumulative doses of cladribine tablets, i.e., either 3.5 mg/kg or 5.25 mg/kg BW or matching placebo. The treatment weeks were started on the first day of the first month (Week 1, Day 1) and of the second month (Week 5, Day 1) of each of both years. The cumulative dose of 5.25 mg/kg BW consisted of six treatment weeks (Weeks 1, 5, 9, 13, 48 and 52). The 3.5 mg/kg dose group received matching placebo tablets in treatment Weeks 9 and 13, and patients assigned to placebo received their treatment according to the schedule of the 5.25 mg/kg BW treatment group. Accordingly, the weekly doses of the 3.5 mg/kg and 5.25 mg/kg BW groups were identical, and the higher total cumulative cladribine dose in the 5.25 mg/kg BW group was achieved by the employment of two additional treatment weeks (i.e., Weeks 9 and 13). Further details of the CLARITY trial have been published elsewhere. 1 
 2.2 ECG substudy of CLARITY The ECG substudy in the target population of RRMS patients was designed to evaluate potential acute and/or cumulative effects of cladribine on the ECG intervals (RR, PR, QRS, QT, QTcB and QTcF) and T‐wave morphology, with a particular emphasis on the heart rate corrected QT interval (QTcF, QTcB), as a well‐accepted surrogate measure signifying delay or heterogeneity in cardiac ventricular repolarization which may possibly be associated with proarrhythmic characteristics of a drug. QTcF was the primary outcome variable. The timing of the ECG assessments within a day (between 0.5 and 3 hours after drug administration) and the day within a treatment week (Day 1) was selected to obtain ECGs at maximum exposure and to allow for proper characterization of the concentration–effect relationship. To allow for a concentration–effect analysis of QT/QTc‐interval data (QTc/PK modelling), the entire ECG population ( n  = 135) formed part of the PK sub‐population ( n  = 173) of the CLARITY study. 2.3 ECG data collection For the ECG substudy, 23 centres from nine countries were appropriately qualified, equipped and quality checked by a dedicated vendor, and central reading of all ECGs by expert cardiologists was applied (eResearchTechnology, Inc., Philadelphia, PA, USA). Standard 12‐lead ECGs were recorded at the study sites in patients randomized to the ECG population. These patients had ECGs collected at pre‐study evaluation, study Day 1 and at Weeks 5, 9, 13, 48 and 52 at the following time points: three ECGs taken 15 minutes apart pre‐dose, and two ECGs taken no longer than five minutes apart between 0.5 and 3 hours post‐dosing. Recordings were made on Day 1 of each treatment week in each patient after at least 15 minutes' rest in the supine position. According to the ECG substudy protocol, a total of 31 ECGs (i.e., three baseline and two post‐dose ECGs at each visit, plus one screening ECG) were to be recorded for each patient. The timing of the ECG assessments within a day (between 0.5 and 3 hours after drug administration) and the day within a week (Day 1) was selected to obtain ECGs at maximum cladribine exposure and to allow for proper characterization of the concentration–effect relationship. Instead of pre‐specifying a fixed post‐dose time, a target time window of 0.5–3 hours post‐dose was specified for random ECG assessments. This time window was selected because it covers the times of the expected  C 
 max  values of the population as well as the initial decline in plasma concentrations, which is important to allow for the characterization of the concentration–effect. The sampling strategy of capturing ECGs at random times within a pre‐specified time window, also had the additional methodological advantage that ECGs in individual patients were captured at different post‐dose times at each occasion of the six different study visits. Hence, this approach provided a set of six “serial” post‐dose ECGs in each individual patient, that were obtained at random times within 0.5 and 3.0 hours post‐dose, essentially following a “population approach” that is well accepted for PK analysis. 2.4 ECG procedures and analysis ECGs were recorded at the qualified sites on each patient and sent to a central laboratory (eResearch Technology, Inc., Philadelphia, PA, USA) for a high‐resolution measurement of the cardiac intervals and morphological assessment by a central cardiologist blinded to the study treatment. ECG measurements were performed using digitization software with magnification of the ECG and on screen callipers by experienced technicians and a centralized cardiologist who was blinded to the tracings. Manual measurements of the RR, PR, QRS and QT interval durations were performed and QTcB, QTcF and heart rate were derived from three consecutive complexes per single ECG. From these values, means were calculated and reported by treatment group. For the QT interval measurement, ECGs were measured in lead II. If lead II was not measurable, lead V5 was used. The following calculations were made from the interval measurements: Heart rate (HR = 60/RR); heart rate corrected QT‐interval using HR‐correction by Fridericia's formula (QTcF = QT/3√RR); heart rate corrected QT‐interval using HR‐correction by Bazett's formula (QTcB = QT/√RR). Abnormal morphology features present on any one of the post‐dosing ECGs were compared with baseline. The occurrences of new T wave inversion and new U waves were documented by treatment group. In line with the ICH E14 Guideline, 10  clinical relevance was defined as a drug‐induced effect on QTc above the upper bound limit of 10 ms. A negative QT/QTc study outcome is one in which the upper bound of the one‐sided 95% confidence interval of the ANOVA analysis for the largest time‐matched mean effect of the drug on the QTc interval is below this threshold for all time‐points. It needs to be acknowledged that the 10 ms threshold refers to acute effects  vs . visit baseline in well‐controlled settings without any confounders such as time and disease effects and concomitant medications. In longitudinal observations in Phase III studies, confounding factors such as disease‐related QT effects and changes in concomitant medications have to be taken into account. Besides this common ECG evaluation by treatment group/dose, a modelling and simulation analysis of the available PK and ECG data was applied to analyse the individual concentration–effect relationships by means of a population approach using NONMEM (Version VI, level 2; Icon Development Solutions, Ellicott City, MD, USA). The primary outcome variable, the HR correction according to Fridericia (QTcF) was pre‐specified in the study protocol. Use of an alpha parameter to account for individual HR correction (e.g., Friberg et al. 2006 11 ) was explored based on the placebo data. Since there was no apparent improvement in describing the data with this approach, and inter‐subject variability in alpha was not supported, QTcF was used as the dependent variable in the analysis. 2.5 Pharmacokinetic assessments To allow for a concentration–effect analysis of QT/QTc‐interval data (QTc/PK modelling), the patients who underwent ECG recording also took part in a pharmacokinetic substudy. Blood samples for quantification of cladribine and major cladribine metabolite (2‐chloroadenine; M1) plasma concentrations were taken following a population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) approach. Samples were taken on the first day of the first treatment week in Year 2, with a first sample taken between 1 and 6 hours after dosing and a second sample 24 hours post dose, prior to intake of the dose on Day 2 of the respective treatment week. Further details on the PopPK analysis were published by Savic et al. 12 
 Plasma concentrations were determined using a validated HPLC–MS/MS with a lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of 0.1 ng/mL for cladribine and for 2‐chloroadenine (M1), respectively. 2.6 Statistical analysis All ECG interval parameters are presented as arithmetic means of two (post‐dose ECGs) or three (baseline ECGs) measurements. ECG interval measurements (RR, PR, QRS, QT, QTcB and QTcF) and heart rate were summarized by treatment group at study and visit baselines, and Weeks 5, 9, 13, 48 and 52. The primary ECG variable was QTcF, that is QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Fridericia's formula. Abnormal morphology features present on any one of the post‐dosing ECGs were compared with study baseline. The ECGs used for defining the study baseline ECG values to define all changes from study baseline were the mean of three ECGs obtained at 15‐minute intervals immediately prior to the first dose of cladribine. Accordingly, the mean of the three ECGs performed pre‐dose at each visit were to define all changes from the visit baseline. The mean of the two post‐dosing ECGs at each visit (two ECGs taken no more than 5 minutes apart within 0.5–3 hours after dosing) were used as the post‐dose interval duration and were compared with both the study and the visit baseline ECG values, by visit. The changes to study and visit baseline of the ECG parameters were analysed by means of an analysis of variance (ANOVA) on change to baseline at subject level with fixed effects for treatment and gender, separately at all defined time points. Based on the model, the differences between cladribine and placebo were estimated, and two‐sided 90% confidence intervals were computed using residual errors. Point estimates and CI intervals for cladribine  vs . placebo were presented graphically. Additionally, the QTcF values were also analysed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment and gender as fixed effects and baseline as covariate, separately at all defined time points. A categorical outlier analysis supplemented the central tendency analysis by determining if there were patients who had remarkable treatment‐emergent values or changes  vs . baseline on any ECG interval or HR that would not be revealed in a mean change from baseline central tendency analysis. The outlier analyses was performed based on number and percentage of patients exceeding the following limits for each time point and treatment: QTcF/QTcB interval &gt;450 ms, &gt;480 ms and &gt;500 ms; QTcF/QTcB interval increase from visit baseline &gt;30 ms and &gt;60 ms; QTcF/QTcB interval increase from study baseline &gt;30 ms and &gt;60 ms; QT interval &gt;500 ms; PQ interval &gt;200 ms; QRS interval &gt;120 ms; HR &lt;50 or &gt;100 beats per minute (bpm) (bradycardia); HR &gt;100 bpm (tachycardia). In addition, linear regression analyses according to Garnett et al. 13  and a modelling and simulation data analysis applying a population approach using NONMEM were conducted to analyse the individual cladribine/QTcF concentration–effect relationships. 2.7 Nomenclature of targets and ligands Key protein targets and ligands in this article are hyperlinked to corresponding entries in  http://www.guidetopharmacology.org , the common portal for data from the IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY, 14  and are permanently archived in the Concise Guide to PHARMACOLOGY 2017/18. 15 
 3 RESULTS 3.1 Patient demographics The population of the ECG substudy was well distributed across the three treatment groups with  n  = 49 and  n  = 48 patients in the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg and 5.25 mg/kg groups, respectively, and  n  = 46 patients in the placebo group (Table  1 ). In accordance with the known epidemiological characteristics of RRMS, more than 98% of patients in the overall ECG substudy population were of Caucasian ethnic origin (White), and about two‐thirds of the patients (65.7%) were women. The mean age (± SD) was 42 ± 11 years, and the mean weight was 73 kg. While race and weight were equally distributed across treatment groups, the patients from the placebo group were on average about 5 and 1 years younger, and also had a 1.5 and 3.0 years shorter disease duration than patients in the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg and 5.25 mg/kg groups, respectively. Differences between the placebo group and the cladribine treatment groups were also apparent with regard to the gender distribution, with a distinctly higher proportion of male patients (50%) in the placebo group, while only 26.8% male patients were enrolled in both cladribine treatment groups.

In general, patients provided a screening ECG and a series of longitudinal ECGs over a time period of 52 weeks (three pre‐dose ECGs and two post‐dose ECGs at each of six visits, i.e., 31 ECGs in total). Analysis of the relative ECG times showed that the majority of ECGs were captured in the pre‐specified time window. The great majority of patients (76 out of 97 in the active dose groups) had at least one ECG between 0.5 hour and 1 hour after cladribine administration, which is the time‐window of the expected achievement of maximum cladribine plasma concentration for most patients. Figure  1  illustrates the individual distribution of ECG and PK sampling times across visits. Figure  2 A shows modelled cladribine plasma concentration–time profiles of the ECG/PK substudy population from the PopPK analysis, Figure  2 B shows the modelled distribution of the times of maximum cladribine plasma concentrations ( t 
 max ) in the ECG/PK substudy population, and Figure  2 C displays the actual distribution of the times of capturing post‐dose ECG data. Overall, the distribution of  t

ECG, electrocardiogram; h, hour; PK, pharmacokinetic 3.3 Heart rate The mean placebo‐corrected change from baseline for the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg and 5.25 mg/kg groups was −1.6 bpm and −1.5 bpm, respectively. There were no significant imbalances in either the bradycardic or tachycardic outliers compared with placebo. 3.4 PR‐ and QRS‐interval duration The mean placebo‐corrected change in PR interval duration from baseline was 3 ms for both the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg and 5.25 mg/kg groups which is of no clinical significance. There was a slight increase in the number of outliers in the 5.25 mg/kg dose group; in that group 1–4 patients per visit showed PR interval duration of &gt;200 ms  vs . no patients in the placebo group and one patient in the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg group. The mean placebo‐corrected change in QRS interval duration from baseline was 0 ms and 1 ms for the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg and 5.25 mg/kg dose groups, respectively; there was one outlier (QRS &gt; 120 ms) in the 5.25 mg/kg dose group, and no outlier patients in the placebo and cladribine 3.5 mg/kg groups. 3.5 Analyses of central QTcF tendencies Comparison of mean visit baseline QTcF values  vs . post‐dose placebo‐adjusted QTcF data (i.e., ΔQTcF) did not show remarkable post‐dose QTcF differences for either of the cladribine treatment groups compared with baseline. At several visits and across all treatment groups including the placebo group, there were consistently minor, transient and clinically insignificant mean post‐dose QTcF increases between 1 and 4 ms  vs . QTcF visit baseline. However, the point estimates and the upper limits of 90% CI for placebo‐corrected post‐dose QTcF changes from visit baseline were at all occasions and for both cladribine treatment groups less than 5 ms (point estimates) and less than 7 ms (upper limit one‐sided of 90% CI), respectively. These results are illustrated in Figure  3 . Figure 3 Point estimates and 90% CIs of QTcF changes (difference to placebo) from visit baseline by cladribine treatment group (ECG population). CI, confidence interval; ECG, electrocardiogram Placebo‐adjusted ANOVA results (point estimates and 90% CI) for the time averaged QTcF changes from visit baseline are summarized for all study visits and both cladribine treatments in Table  2 . These data indicate lack of a clinically relevant acute QTcF prolongation by both employed oral cladribine treatments. The findings were consistent across visits over the entire trial duration.

These mean post‐dose QTcF increases starting from Week 9 were below 9 ms at all time points, with upper 90% CI data below 15 ms. The population PK/PD modelling and simulation analysis indicated that the additional QTcF increment starting at Week 9 amounted on average to about 4.3 ms, and that this effect was only apparent in the female population of the 5.25 mg cladribine dose group (for details, see Section 3.8 below). 3.6 Categorical QTcF outlier analyses No evident outlier incidents were noted in any of the treatment groups, which include absolute QT duration &gt;500 ms, QTcF duration &gt;500 ms, QTcF duration &gt;480 ms, a &gt;60 ms change from study or visit baseline QTcF, and findings of abnormal U waves. The less specific outlier criteria include a QTcF duration &gt;450 ms and a 30–60 ms change (QTcF) from study or visit baseline. None of the patients in the placebo and cladribine 3.5 mg/kg groups, and one (Week 1 and Week 52) to two (Week 9) patient(s) in the cladribine 5.25 mg/kg group showed a slightly prolonged QTcF duration of &gt;450 ms. QTcF post‐dose changes from study baseline ranging between 30 and 60 ms were noted in one (placebo, Week 13) to two patients in each treatment group (cladribine 3.5 mg/kg, Week 9; cladribine 5.25 mg/kg, Week 13). No QTcF changes from visit baseline values ranging between 30 and 60 ms were noted in the placebo group, and only single occasions in both cladribine treatment groups (cladribine 3.5 mg/kg one patient in Weeks 5 and 48; cladribine 5.25 mg/kg one patient in Weeks 1, 9 and 48). There were no notable dose or time dependencies (i.e., apparent relationship to the total cumulative cladribine dose) in the pattern of the less specific outlier criteria in the cladribine treatment groups. 3.7 T‐ and U‐wave morphology changes The morphological changes upon both cladribine treatment dose regimens did not show any significant changes in T‐ or U‐wave morphology compared with visit or study baseline ECGs, and no differences compared with placebo. A single patient in the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg group showed an inverted T‐wave on three occasions (Weeks 1, 5 and 9). 3.8 Population PK/PD modelling and simulation analysis The results of the PK/QTcF modelling and simulation analysis were overall highly consistent with the results of the standard descriptive and ANOVA data analyses by treatment groups as detailed above. The pre‐dose QTcF was estimated to be 405 ms for women and 385 ms for men. The inter‐individual and inter‐occasion variability (expressed as coefficients of variation) in the baseline QTcF were estimated to be 3.5% and 1.7%, respectively, and the additive residual error variability was 8.7 ms. There was a minor, clinically insignificant (albeit statistically significant) mean post‐dose increase of 2.0 ms in QTcF 0.5–4 hours after treatment administration that was similar for placebo‐ and cladribine‐treated patients. There was no other significant increase with time or a relationship between QTcF and concentration of cladribine, concentration of 2‐chloroadenine (M1) or cladribine dose, except a 4.3 ms QTcF increase that was only observed in female patients of the 5.25 mg cladribine group, starting at Week 13 and remaining essentially unchanged throughout the following visits, despite continued cladribine treatment at Weeks 48 and 52. 3.9 Correlation of cladribine plasma concentration and QTcF Available cladribine plasma concentration data and QTcF interval data were subjected to two different linear regression analyses by using QTcF study and visit baseline data. For the analyses, all observations with a time difference of less than 1 hour between PK sampling and ECG assessment were included, and the correlation between the placebo‐adjusted post‐dose QTcF differences to baseline QTcF (∆∆QTcF) with the corresponding cladribine plasma concentrations was analysed according to the approach proposed by Garnett et al. 13  For the placebo adjustment, the mean of the post‐dose QTcF values within the placebo group was calculated for each visit. The analysis was performed by using both study and visit baselines. The results of both analyses are highly consistent and illustrated in Figure  4  for the study baseline analysis, and Hermann et al. 16  for the visit baseline analysis. Figure 4 Cladribine plasma concentration  vs.  ∆∆QTcF using study baseline in the ECG/PK subpopulation of the CLARITY trial. ECG, electrocardiogram; PK, pharmacokinetic Both linear regression analyses of placebo‐adjusted post‐dose QTcF data (∆∆QTcF) to study and visit baseline QTcF values and the corresponding actual cladribine plasma concentrations resulted in slopes very close to zero and corresponding non‐significant  p ‐values for both baseline scenarios (Figure  4  and Hermann et al. 16 ). Accordingly, the linear regression analyses indicate that there is no significant correlation between the QTcF interval duration and cladribine plasma concentrations. 4 DISCUSSION Some non‐cardiac drugs have been found to have undesired proarrhythmic effects which go along with a prolongation of the QT/QTc interval in the ECG and are associated with a specific polymorphic form of a ventricular tachycardia denoted as Torsade de Pointes (TdP). TdP can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation in about 20% of cases, and an overall mortality between 10 and 17% has been reported. 17  Over the last two decades, the single most common cause for the withdrawal or restriction of the use of marketed drugs has been the prolongation of the QT/QTc interval associated with TdP. 18  Furthermore, many of these drugs were not thought to have adverse cardiac effects based on their respective mechanisms of action, highlighting the importance of evaluating cardiac safety during clinical development. 19 
 Regulatory authorities have established a framework of preclinical and clinical development requirements for characterization of all new chemical entities (NCEs) for their effect on cardiac repolarization. These are defined by the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Guidelines SB7 (preclinical) and E14 (clinical). 7 ,  20  Guideline ICH E14 describes the clinical evaluation of drug‐induced QTc prolongation via a well‐controlled clinical study, the TQT study, typically conducted in healthy volunteers with employment of supra‐therapeutic doses and positive control treatments, as the primary method of evaluating the QT liability of NCEs during their development. As science develops, these guidelines become subject to updates and amendments such as the recently issued Q&amp;A document R3 to the ICH E14 Guideline. 10  Therein it is acknowledged that in certain cases conventional TQT studies might not be feasible, and suggests a variety of study design and data analysis considerations—including concentration effect analyses and modelling—to address the clinical development needs for cardiac safety testing in such cases. The intense ECG substudy of cladribine tablets presented here applied many of the suggested methodological approaches of ICH E14 (R3) before the document was issued. Repeat‐dose TQT studies in healthy subjects were conducted for other recently approved orally acting RMS disease‐modifying drugs with shorter duration of immune‐suppressive effects, such as fingolimod and teriflunomide. While the teriflunomide TQT study did not show potential for prolonging the QTcF interval at mean therapeutic steady‐state concentrations compared with placebo, 21  with fingolimod a mild QTc prolongation was seen in a dedicated TQT study. 22  However, this study has not yet been published. The only quantitative information on the QTc prolongation potential of fingolimod can be found in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) 23  where it is stated that doses of 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg fingolimod at steady‐state resulted in a prolongation of QTc with the upper limit of the 90% CI ≤13.0 ms. Cladribine tablets 10 mg have recently been approved in Europe, Australia, Canada and several other countries and regions for the treatment of adult patients with certain types of relapsing MS (RMS). The recommended dose is 3.5 mg/kg BW, consisting of two annual courses, each comprising two treatment weeks one month apart. Cladribine tablets exert a selective mode of action on B and T lymphocytes which goes along with a long‐lasting reduction in lymphocyte count. 5 ,  6  Given this mode of action, the examination of cardiac safety by means of a TQT study was not feasible. Therefore, an intense ECG substudy as part of a multinational, large‐scale Phase III study (the CLARITY trial) has been designed as an alternative approach to detect and characterize possible drug effects on the QT/QTc interval of the ECG. Such an alternative approach has also been suggested by others. 8 ,  9 
 The data collection in the intense ECG substudy applied important methodological prerequisites to enable accurate measurement and quantification of the time intervals of the ECGs. These measures included appropriately qualified and trained personnel at selected study centres, validated 12‐lead ECG machines provided, maintained and quality checked by a dedicated vendor, replicate ECG collection (i.e., triplicate at baseline and duplicate for all post‐dose ECGs), and fully manual central reading of all ECGs by expert cardiologists (eResearchTechnology, Inc., Philadelphia, PA, USA). ECGs were always captured on the first day of each treatment week, in accordance with the BW‐adjusted dose regimen. All patients with a BW of ≥60 kg received the maximum recommended daily dose of 20 mg cladribine tablets on the first day of each treatment week, and no accumulation of cladribine plasma concentrations occurred upon once‐daily repeated dosing. The CLARITY study protocol aimed to comply with the MS‐specific medical needs of the participating patients throughout the duration of the trial. Therefore, only a few medications were excluded by the study protocol for safety reasons (i.e. essentially immunomodulatory/immunosuppressive therapies, cytokine or anti‐cytokine therapy, and concomitant usage of medications that could affect gastrointestinal motility and absorption of cladribine, including proton pump inhibitors and H 2  antagonists). All other medications that were considered necessary for the subjects' welfare and deemed unlikely to interfere with the study medication were allowed to be given at the discretion of the investigators. This implies that the study did not restrict the use of concomitant medications that may have had effects on the QTc interval. As there were only a few individual QTcF outlier incidences observed in the study population and these were well balanced across the treatment groups, concomitant medications were not considered as a covariate in the analysis. The additional employment of PK blood samplings for the examination of the relationship between drug concentration and QT/QTc interval provided important additional and robust information for the overall interpretation of the captured longitudinal ECG data in a heterogeneous RMS patient population. For the ECG‐ and PK‐sampling strategy, a sparse data population approach was chosen with application of random PK and ECG sampling times in a time‐window of the expected maximum drug exposure, i.e., 0–3 hours post‐dose (PK samples at 0–6 hours and at 24 hours post‐dose). Although the acquisition of only one post‐dose ECG time point (with duplicate ECG acquisition) on each visit may be seen as a limitation, the repeated performance of this procedure over six visits in 143 patients participating in the ECG substudy provided a total sample of 1534 post‐dose ECGs, which can be considered a solid database for the evaluation of drug effects on the QT/QTc interval and the examination of concentration effects. Recently it was explicitly acknowledged in ICH E14 (R3) 10  that concentration–response analyses, in which all available data across all doses are used to characterize the potential for a drug to influence QTc, can serve as an alternative to the by‐time‐point analysis or intersection–union test as the primary basis for decisions to classify the risk of a drug. In either case this result is an important component of the totality of evidence assessment of the risk of QT prolongation. Another aspect of this design feature is that this approach was associated with minimal discomfort and PK sampling burden of the patients, but allowed ECG and PK collection over a wide range of plasma concentrations despite the low sampling burden. As shown in Figure  4 , a broad range of cladribine plasma concentrations was indeed covered. The repeated acquisition of ECG and PK data at all study visits further allowed a longitudinal analysis and demonstration of the cardiac safety of cladribine tablets over the entire treatment duration. However, the interpretation of serial long‐term ECG data in patients with MS may be challenging and complicated, because progression of the disease itself may lead to cardiac repolarization abnormalities (i.e. time effects), due to disease‐related dysfunctions of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), probably based on axonal lesions either at the level of spinal cord or the ANS nuclei that are located in the periventricular region of the fourth ventricle. Various studies have shown evidence of QTc prolongation in MS patients over time with progression of the disease. 24 ,  25 ,  26  A recent MRI study 27  confirmed these results in RMS patients by three‐dimensional quantification of brain lesion load at the level of the structures involved in superior autonomic control (insula, cingulate cortex and amygdala‐hippocampus). Overall, 16% of the patients had an increased QTc interval. The QTc interval length was correlated with disease duration, cortical insular lesion volume and grey matter lesion volume in the three examined areas and inversely correlated with global and insular cortical thickness. As the distribution of MS‐related alterations of ANS functions across treatment groups is likely to occur by chance, and randomization cannot account for these events, disease‐related QTc changes with time have to be taken into account as a confounding factor in the interpretation of the long‐term serial ECG data. In this context, a limitation of the study was that the randomization of the ECG population resulted in a larger proportion of women and of patients with a longer history of illness in the cladribine treatment groups as compared with placebo (Table  1 ). Importantly, the largest proportion of women (75%  vs . 50% in the placebo group) and the longest disease duration (11.7 years  vs . 8.7 years in the placebo group) were noted in the cladribine 5.25 mg/kg group. Based on this, it cannot be excluded that these randomization imbalances for important population factors may have contributed to the apparent time‐effects on QT/QTc in the cladribine 5.25 mg/kg group, rather than reflecting cumulative drug effects. However, the ANOVA results of both cladribine treatment groups for the placebo‐adjusted QTcF changes (ΔΔQTcF) from visit baseline indicated that post‐dose QTcF means were consistently below 5 ms across all visits, and that the respective upper 90% CIs were consistently below 10 ms, suggesting a lack of clinically relevant effects of oral cladribine treatment on cardiac repolarization (Table  2 ). For the 3.5 mg/kg cladribine group, the same holds true for the comparisons to study baseline, with the exception of a single occasion slightly above these limits (Week 48 with mean QTcF of 5.99 ms and a corresponding 90% CI of 11.44 ms; Table  3 ). These results are confirmed by the linear regression concentration–effect analysis of ΔΔQTcF according to Garnett et al. 13  (Figure  4  and Hermann et al. 16 ), which indicate that there is no significant correlation between the placebo‐adjusted post‐dose QTcF interval duration and cladribine plasma concentrations regardless of whether study or visit baseline comparisons are considered. Finally, the categorical outlier analyses also did not indicate a clinically meaningful potential of cladribine to cause QT/QTc prolongation. No cladribine‐ or placebo‐treated patients met the criteria for evident outliers (i.e., QTcF duration &gt;480 ms and/or a post‐dose change of &gt;60 ms from baseline), and only a few incidents met the nonspecific outlier criterion of a 30–60 ms QTcF change from study baseline when the 3.5 mg/kg dose regimen (approved in Europe and other regions) is considered. The slightly higher number of 30–60 ms QTcF changes in the 5.25 mg/kg dose group appears compatible with the modest time‐effect on QT/QTc duration in this particular group. 5 CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, the ECG results presented here indicate that cladribine showed no evidence of any effect on heart rate, AV conduction or cardiac depolarization as measured by the PR and QRS interval durations. No significant changes in T‐wave morphology were observed in either of the cladribine treatment groups. Overall, the data showed no evidence of an acute cladribine concentration‐dependent effect on cardiac repolarization. Considering the challenges associated with the long duration of the trial, and the possible contributing factors of the subjects' underlying condition, the QTcF outcomes were found to be highly consistent over time  vs . visit baseline data, indicating that cladribine does not confer a clinically meaningful long‐term effect on cardiac repolarization. Considering the recent marketing approval of cladribine tablets for MS in Europe and other regions, and the up‐to‐date assessment methodology used for cardiac safety evaluation, this report is highly relevant for the practising community, and also to clinical researchers involved in cardiac safety testing of novel products.

    <Body>What is Already Known about this Subject 
 The PK profile of obinutuzumab is well described by a two‐compartment PK model comprising both a linear and nonlinear time‐varying clearance pathway. This is based on PK data from mainly Caucasian patients in previous studies such as GAUGUIN, GAUDI, GAUSS, GATHER and GADOLIN. 
 What this Study Adds 
 NCA showed a similar PK profile in Chinese patients with FL, DLBCL and CLL. The current study confirms that obinutuzumab exposure is similar in Chinese and non‐Chinese patients with CD20+ malignant B‐cell lymphomas.

 Introduction B‐cell lymphoproliferative diseases are a heterogeneous group of malignancies that range from slow‐growing indolent and incurable diseases, such as follicular lymphoma (FL) or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), to more aggressive diffuse large B‐cell lymphomas (DLBCL). In China, there are few epidemiological data for lymphoma. According to a nationwide collaborative study of 10 002 lymphoma cases diagnosed in 2010, DLBCL is the most common B‐cell lymphoma subtype in China, accounting for 50.2% of all cases, compared with 8.3% for FL and 6.4% for CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma  3 . The relatively low incidence of CLL among the Chinese population was also highlighted in a North American survey, which reported a world age‐standardized rate (per 100 000) for CLL of 0.40 among the Chinese population in British Columbia compared with 1.71 among the non‐Chinese population  4 . Despite the availability of various agents for the treatment of non‐Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and CLL, there is an ongoing need for the development of safe and effective therapies to prolong remission in patients and to improve cure rates. Obinutuzumab (GAZYVA/GAZYVARO) is a novel glycoengineered type II monoclonal antibody (mAb). The main characteristics of obinutuzumab are high‐affinity binding to the CD20 antigen, and high antibody‐dependent cellular toxicity, antibody‐dependent cellular phagocytosis and cell death induction, combined with low complement‐dependent cytotoxic activity  5 ,  6 . Regulatory approval has recently been granted in Europe, the United States and other countries worldwide for use of obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil to treat previously untreated patients with CLL  7 ,  8 . The basis for this approval was data from the Phase III CLL11 study showing a statistically significant improvement in progression‐free survival (PFS) with obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil compared with rituximab plus chlorambucil in treatment‐naïve CLL patients ( n  = 781) with comorbidities (median PFS 29.2  vs.  15.4 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.33, 0.50;  P  &lt; 0.001)  9 ,  10 . Obinutuzumab also demonstrated promising activity in patients with rituximab‐refractory CLL and NHL in the single‐arm Phase II GAUGUIN study  11 ,  12  and a higher overall response rate compared with rituximab in patients with relapsed indolent lymphoma in the Phase II GAUSS study  13 . Subsequently, the Phase III GADOLIN study in patients with rituximab‐refractory indolent NHL showed that independently‐assessed PFS was longer after treatment with obinutuzumab plus bendamustine than after bendamustine alone (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.4, 0.74;  P  = 0.00011)  14 . The pharmacokinetics (PK) of obinutuzumab are well described by a two‐compartment PK model comprising linear and nonlinear time‐varying clearance pathways  15 . To date, several studies have examined the PK of obinutuzumab in patients with NHL and CLL, for example the Phase II GAUGUIN study (NCT00517530  11 ,  12 ) in Caucasian patients  11 ,  12 ,  16 ,  17 ,  18 , and a Phase I Japanese study  19 . Other studies assessing obinutuzumab PK include CLL11 (NCT01010061  9 ), GAUDI (NCT00825149  20 ,  21 , GAUSS (NCT00576758  13 ), GATHER (NCT01414855) and GADOLIN (NCT01059630  22 ). However, PK bridging studies are a frequent requirement of Asian drug regulatory authorities when considering a new therapeutic entity  23 . The primary purpose of the current study (GERSHWIN; NCT01680991) was to assess the PK profile of obinutuzumab following administration of multiple intravenous (i.v.) doses to Chinese patients with CD20+ malignant B‐cell lymphomas and to compare the findings with those from other obinutuzumab PK studies in mainly Caucasian (non‐Chinese) patients using a population PK approach. Safety, tolerability and efficacy of obinutuzumab were secondary objectives of the current study and will be published separately. Methods Study design and treatment This was a Phase Ib, open‐label, single‐arm interventional study (GERSHWIN) enrolling patients from four centres in China from 6 September 2012 to 15 August 2013. GERSHWIN was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Cancer Institute and Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, in May 2012 (12–047/581). All patients provided written informed consent to participate in the study. The treatment period was 24 weeks; patients received obinutuzumab 1000 mg i.v. on Days 1, 8 and 15 of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of Cycles 2 to 8 (each cycle lasted 21 days). The first infusion of obinutuzumab on Cycle 1, Day 1 was given as a split dose over 2 days in CLL patients. For the first infusion, obinutuzumab was administered at an initial rate of 50 mg h −1  in patients with NHL. In the absence of infusion‐related reactions, the infusion rate was increased by 50 mg h −1  every 30 min to a maximum of 400 mg h −1 . In CLL patients, the first two infusions were given at a dose of 100 mg at a rate of 25 mg h −1  over 4 h on Day 1 and at a dose of 900 mg starting at 50 mg h −1  on Day 2, increasing by 50 mg h −1  every 30 min to a maximum of 400 mg h −1 . If the first obinutuzumab infusion was well tolerated by the patient (CLL or NHL), subsequent infusions were given at an initial rate of 100 mg h −1  and increased by 100 mg h −1  increments at 30‐min intervals (as tolerated) to a maximum rate of 400 mg h −1 . Obinutuzumab aqueous solution was supplied in a 50 ml glass vial containing 1000 mg of drug in 40 ml of solution (25 mg ml −1 ), together with the excipients histidine, trehalose and poloxamer 188. Before infusion, obinutuzumab was diluted by adding 40 ml of solution to 210 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride solution in an infusion bag, to produce a final concentration for infusion of 4 mg ml −1 . Study population Patients were aged &gt;18 years with histologically documented CD20+ relapsed/refractory CLL, DLBCL or FL, an Eastern Co‐operative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 and a life expectancy of &gt;6 months. Patients with FL or DLBCL could be included if they had failed (relapsing after, or refractory to) at least one chemotherapy regimen with or without rituximab at any point in their treatment history. CLL patients could be included if they had relapsed after, or were refractory to at least one chemotherapy regimen at any point in their treatment history. Relapse was defined as disease recurrence after any documented history of response (complete response [CR], CR with incomplete bone marrow recovery [CRi; patients with CLL only] or partial response [PR]) that lasted at least 6 months. Refractory was defined as progression on treatment or stable disease (SD), or any response that was followed by progression less than 6 months after treatment. With the exception of CLL patients, all patients must have had at least one bi‐dimensionally measurable lesion (&gt;1.5 cm in its largest dimension by computed tomography). For CLL patients, circulating lymphocyte count assessments were an acceptable method of measurement. All measurable and evaluable disease was required to be assessed and documented before study treatment initiation. Tumour response was assessed according to the International Workshop to Standardize Response criteria for NHL  24 , and the 2008 guidelines of the International Workshop on CLL  25 . Full inclusion criteria and details of patient exclusion criteria can be found in Appendix  I . Study endpoints and procedures Blood samples for the measurement of obinutuzumab serum concentrations (5 ml pre‐dose on Cycle 1, Day 1; 2 ml for all other samples) were collected as follows. For NHL patients, Day 1 samples were collected pre‐dose, at the end of infusion, and at 4, 24, 72 and 120 h post‐infusion. For CLL patients, Day 1 and Day 2 samples were collected pre‐dose and at the end of infusion, and also at 4, 24, 72 and 120 h post‐infusion on Day 2. The additional sampling for CLL patients reflected the split dosing of obinutuzumab over Days 1 and 2 in this group. Additional blood samples (all patients) were collected pre‐dose and at the end of infusion for all subsequent doses, and at 4, 24, 72, 120, 168, 336, 504 and 672 h and 3 and 6 months after the final infusion (Cycle 8, Day 1). Obinutuzumab serum concentrations were measured using a specific and validated enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Samples were pre‐incubated with a cocktail containing biotinylated and digoxigenin‐labelled anti‐idiotype antibodies directed to the antigen binding site of obinutuzumab. Using a streptavidin‐coated microplate, immune complexes bound to the microplate were detected by addition of horseradish peroxidase‐conjugated Fab fragments directed to digoxigenin. Bound peroxidase was detected through a chromogenic reaction. The absorbance (405 nm for detection absorbance and 490 nm for reference absorbance) was proportional to the amount of obinutuzumab present in the sample. PK parameters were either read directly from plasma concentration–time profiles or calculated using standard non‐compartmental methods. The lower limit of quantification in undiluted serum was 0.00405 μg ml −1 . The calibration range concentrations were 0.00405–0.400 μg ml −1  in 100% human serum. The accuracy of the ELISA method (using quality control samples) for determination of obinutuzumab serum sample concentrations was consistent throughout the study: precision ranged from 4.43% to 25.2% and accuracy ranged from 95.1% to 100.0%. Pharmacokinetic analyses The PK analysis population included all patients randomized and adherent to the study protocol. Pharmacokinetic analyses using non‐compartmental analysis (NCA) PK parameters of obinutuzumab for each patient were estimated using NCA (Phoenix WinNonlin ®  version 6.2; Certara ®  USA, Inc.). Time to maximum observed serum concentration ( t 
 max ), maximum observed serum concentration ( C 
 max ), and trough concentration before the next dose ( C 
 trough ) were obtained directly from plasma  vs.  time profiles. The following PK parameters were calculated: apparent terminal half‐life ( t 
 1/2 ), area under the serum concentration–time curve from 0 to Day 7 ( AUC 
 7d ), area under the serum concentration–time curve from 0 to Day 21 ( AUC 
 21d ) at Cycle 8, systemic clearance ( CL 
 ss ), and volume of distribution at steady state ( V 
 ss ). All computed PK parameters were presented as summary statistics, including arithmetic means, geometric means (e.g.  AUC  and  C 
 max ), medians, ranges, standard deviations and coefficients of variation (CV%). Individual and mean serum concentrations of obinutuzumab  vs.  time were graphically displayed. Population pharmacokinetic analysis To determine whether observed obinutuzumab PK data from GERSHWIN (available for 48 Chinese patients) were in accordance with obinutuzumab PK data from previous clinical studies, a robust population PK model previously developed in a large database of 961 lymphoma patients (mainly Caucasian [95%]: 342 CLL; 469 indolent NHL [406 FL]; 130 DLBCL; 20 mantle cell lymphoma]) was used to simulate PK profiles in the GERSHWIN study (unpublished data on file, F. Hoffmann‐La Roche Ltd, Clinical Pharmacology, Basel, Switzerland). Simulations were conducted by taking into account patients’ baseline characteristics (e.g. tumour size, body weight, gender) in the current study, and were run 100 times to determine the median, 5th and 95th predicted PK profile. The adequacy of matching between observed obinutuzumab concentrations in GERSHWIN and predicted PK profiles was assessed graphically by overlaying the observed PK data with the predicted mean profile and its associated 90% prediction interval. Full details of the population PK model have been published previously by Gibiansky  et al. 
 15 . Results Patients Of 56 Chinese patients screened, 48 patients (FL,  n  = 13; DLBCL,  n  = 23; CLL,  n  = 12) were enrolled and 28 patients (58.3%) completed treatment. Seventeen patients discontinued obinutuzumab during Cycles 1–4 and three patients discontinued obinutuzumab during Cycles 5–8. Reasons for discontinuation of obinutuzumab included progressive disease ( n  = 9), physician decision ( n  = 6), withdrawal by patient ( n  = 3), adverse event (pneumonia) and protocol violation ( n  = 1 each). A total of 141 adverse events were reported by 35 patients, most of which were of mild or moderate severity (116; 82.3%). The most commonly reported adverse events were infusion‐related reactions (15 patients; 31.2%), all of which occurred after the first obinutuzumab infusion. A full report of safety results from the study will be published separately. The PK analysis population included 48 patients: 28 patients (FL,  n  = 11; DLBCL,  n  = 8; CLL,  n  = 9) completed the eight‐cycle PK sample collection. Three patients (DLBCL,  n  = 2; CLL,  n  = 1) were excluded from the Cycle 1 PK analysis due to limited PK sampling and an additional two patients (DLBCL,  n  = 2) were excluded from the analysis of  t 
 1/2  and  V 
 ss  at Cycle 8 only, because their values could not be reliably estimated. Most patients had advanced‐stage disease (Binet B or C for CLL, Ann Arbor 3–4 for FL or DLBCL) and the median number of prior treatment lines was similar across lymphoma types (CLL, 2.0; DLBCL, 2.0; FL, 3.0) (Table  1 ).

 max  and  AUC 
 21d  as well as other derived PK parameters showed the PK profile of obinutuzumab to be very similar for the three lymphoma types (Table  2 ). Mean serum concentrations of obinutuzumab over Cycles 1–8 showed that  C 
 max  and  C 
 trough  steady‐state levels appeared to be achieved at the start of Cycle 2, irrespective of histology. Concentration–time profiles were similar for the three lymphoma types (Figure  2 ) ,  with a slight increase in serum levels of obinutuzumab from Cycles 5/6–8 in patients with DLBCL or CLL. Systemic exposure to obinutuzumab after the Cycle 8 dose ( AUC 
 21d  value) was not dependent on body weight for any of the three lymphoma types (Figure  3 ), although a slight trend for decreased  AUC  with increased body weight was seen for FL patients ( P  = 0.286;  P  = 0.876 for DLBCL;  P  = 0.897 for CLL). Inter‐subject variability of obinutuzumab exposure appeared to be slightly higher for patients with CLL (CV% estimated to be &lt;43% for  AUC  and &lt;33% for  C 
 max  for both cycles) than for patients with DLBCL or FL (CV% estimated to be &lt;38% for  AUC  and &lt;29% for  C 
 max  for both cycles). Figure 3 Relationship between body weight and obinutuzumab area under the serum concentration–time curve (Day 0 to Day 21) ( AUC 
 21d ) in patients with follicular lymphoma (FL), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) post‐obinutuzumab administration (1000 mg i.v.) at Cycle 8 Population pharmacokinetic analysis Population PK analysis showed that most PK profiles from Chinese patients observed in GERSHWIN lay within the 90% prediction interval of the simulated profiles, indicating that PK data in Chinese patients were in agreement with the PK characteristics in non‐Chinese lymphoma patients (which were established previously using population PK methods) (Figure  4 ). Figure 4 Comparison of simulated pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles and observed PK data in GERSHWIN for (A) follicular lymphoma (FL), (B) diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and (C) chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) patients from Cycle 1 to Cycle 8. DV, dependent variable; PI, prediction interval Discussion Non‐compartmental analysis of Chinese patients in the Phase Ib GERSHWIN study showed that the PK profile of obinutuzumab is similar in patients with FL, DLBCL and CLL. Steady‐state concentrations of obinutuzumab appeared to be reached at the start of Cycle 2 dosing irrespective of histology, and there was no apparent relationship between body weight and  AUC . In addition, estimated exposure at steady state (e.g. Cycle 8  AUC 
 21d  and  C 
 max ) for Chinese patients with DLBCL and FL was generally similar to that for Chinese patients with CLL. A two‐compartment PK model comprising linear and nonlinear time‐varying clearance pathways has been shown to adequately describe serum obinutuzumab concentration data. The initial clearance of obinutuzumab is more than two times higher than the steady‐state clearance; this is consistent with a decrease in the time‐varying clearance component, which is high at the start of treatment and then declines with administration of repeated cycles of obinutuzumab. The time‐varying clearance pathway is consistent with target‐mediated drug disposition, such that at the start of treatment, obinutuzumab is bound to a large quantity of CD20+ cells. With repeated dosing of obinutuzumab, the pool of CD20+ cells becomes saturated, hence reducing the contribution of this component to overall clearance. The linear clearance pathway is consistent with catabolism of immunoglobulin G antibodies, and is therefore independent of CD20+ cells. These observations support the need to minimize the time‐varying clearance component quickly, and led to the proposed obinutuzumab dose regimen of 1000 mg for both induction and extended treatment  15 . In addition to the non‐compartmental PK analysis, a population PK assessment was performed to determine whether data from GERSHWIN were in accordance with previously collected PK data in mainly Caucasian patients for obinutuzumab. A population PK model comprising 961 patients was used to simulate PK profiles in the current study. The results from this population PK analysis support our main finding that observed obinutuzumab PK parameters are similar across Chinese and non‐Chinese patients with CLL, DLBCL and FL. The PK profile of obinutuzumab reported in the current study was similar to that reported in two previous studies evaluating obinutuzumab PK in relapsed or refractory CLL and NHL patients from Europe (GAUGUIN, Phase II)  11 ,  12 ,  16  and Japan (Phase I)  19  (Table  3 ). In a Phase II update of the GAUGUIN study, 12 CLL and 47 NHL (relapsed/refractory) patients had PK data available at Cycle 8. The NHL patients comprised 30 cases of indolent NHL (including FL) and 17 cases of aggressive NHL (including DLBCL), and all patients were Caucasian except for one Asian patient with CLL. The doses of obinutuzumab were 1000 mg for CLL and 400/800 mg for NHL. Notably, the primary PK parameters for obinutuzumab at Cycle 8, i.e. geometric mean dose‐adjusted  C 
 max ,  C 
 trough  and  AUC 
 21d , were similar between GAUGUIN and the current study for both NHL and CLL ( C 
 max /dose 0.75–0.94  vs.  0.87–1.05 μg ml −1  mg −1 ;  C 
 trough /dose 0.40–0.52  vs.  0.35–0.46 μg ml −1  mg −1 ;  AUC 
 21d /dose 11.0–14.7  vs.  11.3–13.0 day·μg ml −1  mg −1 ) (Table  3 ). In the Phase I Japanese study, PK data were available for 10 patients with NHL across four dose cohorts at Cycle 8. Each cohort received a lower initial obinutuzumab dose, which was then increased for the second and subsequent doses (i.e. 200/400 mg, 400/800 mg, 800/1200 mg, and 1200/2000 mg). All patients were Japanese and the majority had FL. Despite the small sample size, the dose‐adjusted PK data for obinutuzumab ( C 
 max /dose 0.87–1.50 μg ml −1  mg −1 ;  C 
 trough /dose 0.36–1.05 μg ml −1  mg −1 ;  AUC 
 21d /dose 9.0–14.9 day·μg ml −1  mg −1 ) were comparable with the data reported in the current study, which also had a relatively small sample size ( n  = 48).

Notably, our finding that the PK profile of obinutuzumab is similar in Chinese  vs.  non‐Chinese patients is consistent with the similar PK profiles observed for other mAbs across ethnic populations. Both intrinsic (e.g. genetic and physiological differences) and extrinsic ethnic factors (e.g. cultural and environmental differences) can impact on drug disposition, safety and efficacy; however, there is an increasing body of evidence to suggest that ethnicity, after accounting for body weight differences, may not influence the PK profile of biologics to the same degree that it does for small molecules  26 . Reasons for this include a lack of involvement of hepatic metabolism in the clearance and elimination of mAbs and the fact that mAbs are administered parenterally, thereby avoiding any impact of dietary factors on systemic exposure. This is also borne out by a recent review by Zhou  et al.  showing that the dosing regimens of 12 mAbs approved in the USA and Japan are identical or very similar in both countries  23 . In conclusion, we provide evidence that obinutuzumab exposure is comparable in Chinese patients with CLL, DLBCL and FL. Results indicate that PK characteristics in Chinese patients are similar to those reported in non‐Chinese patients with CD20+ malignant B‐cell lymphomas. Furthermore, our population PK analysis confirms that the PK data observed are in agreement with the previously established PK characteristics of obinutuzumab in non‐Chinese patients with CLL, DLBCL and FL.

 Introduction Despite declining rates, cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in Europe  4 ,  5 . It is now clear that correcting elevated plasma LDL cholesterol (LDL‐C) is an effective way to reduce CV risk  6 ,  7 . In practice, a large proportion of patients with very high CV risk do not reach the target LDL‐C level recommended in Europe (&lt;1.8 mmol l –1  [70 mg dl –1 ]) despite receiving treatment with statins, as shown by the EUROASPIRE IV study  5 ,  7 . Inadequate control of LDL‐C in clinical practice indicates a need for more effective treatments. It may also indicate poor adherence to treatment, which is a particular concern in patients with very high CV risk  8 ,  9  and in those with comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension, who need to take multiple medications  9 . In addition, statins are not well tolerated by 10–15% of patients  10 . High LDL‐C levels can be influenced by lifestyle to some extent, but are mainly due to polymorphisms at numerous genetic loci  11 ,  12 ,  13 . The highly penetrant genetic mutations affecting the LDL receptor (LDLR) and apolipoprotein B have long been known to cause familial hypercholesterolaemia  14 . In 2003, a third locus associated with this inherited condition was identified: proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9)  15 . The PCSK9 protein binds to LDLRs, targeting them for lysosomal degradation; this prevents the receptors from binding LDL‐C and removing it from the circulation and therefore raises serum LDL‐C concentrations  16 . The use of monoclonal antibodies that target PCSK9 in order to reduce plasma LDL‐C is a new approach for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia and may help address the unmet clinical need of achieving LDL‐C targets for the majority of patients with high CV risk. Two fully human anti‐PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies have recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA): alirocumab and evolocumab  17 ,  18 ,  19 ,  20 . Other PCSK9 inhibitors are in development  21 ,  22 . In the USA, alirocumab and evolocumab are indicated for use in adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HeFH) or clinical atherosclerotic CVD, such as heart attack or stroke, who require additional LDL‐C lowering  17 ,  18 . Alirocumab and evolocumab are both used in addition to diet and maximum tolerated statin therapy  17 ,  18 . Evolocumab is also approved for use in combination with other LDL‐C‐lowering therapies in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HoFH). In Europe, alirocumab and evolocumab are approved as an adjunct to diet for use in adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia (HeFH and non‐familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia who do not achieve target LDL‐C with other lipid‐lowering medication and in patients with statin intolerance  19 ,  20 . Evolocumab is also approved for use in combination with other lipid‐lowering therapies in patients aged 12 years and older with HoFH  20 . PCSK9 is predominantly synthesized in the liver and is secreted into the circulation, where it has a half‐life of approximately 5 minutes  23 . The anti‐PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies bind circulating PCSK9, preventing PCSK9‐mediated degradation of the LDLR. In the absence of PCSK9, the number of receptors on the cell surface increases and more circulating LDL‐C is removed  16 . Upon saturation of circulating PCSK9, any unbound antibody binds to PCSK9 as it is synthesized and released from the liver cells  24 . At this stage, increases in the antibody concentrations do not reduce LDL‐C further but extend the duration of LDL‐C lowering  19 ,  25 ,  26 . Eventually, the amount of circulating PCSK9 saturates the circulating unbound antibody and LDL‐C levels return to baseline  24 ,  25 . Alirocumab and evolocumab have the same mechanism of action. Both antibodies are cleared more quickly in patients receiving concomitant statins  19 ,  20  because statins increase the production of PCSK9  27 ,  28 . This elevation in PCSK9 levels is thought to result from statin‐induced intracellular cholesterol depletion via sterol regulatory element binding proteins, which in turn promotes transcription of PCSK9  24 ,  28 . Despite this effect, the reduction in LDL‐C in patients receiving the recommended dose of either antibody is similar whether or not they are receiving concomitant statins  19 ,  20 . Following Phase 2 trials of alirocumab, which found a dose of 150 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) to be more effective than a higher dose of 200 mg or 300 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W)  29 ,  30 , a pooled study of Phase 3 trials evaluated two regimens of alirocumab with concomitant statins: 150 mg Q2W and 75 mg Q2W with a criteria‐based up‐titration to 150 mg Q2W at week 12 (which led to an additional 14% LDL‐C reduction)  31 . As a result of these studies, the titration regimen was recommended for all patients except those requiring LDL‐C reductions of more than 60%, in whom 150 mg Q2W should be the starting dose  19 . The efficacy of alirocumab does not appear to be influenced by age, body mass index, intensity of statin treatment or baseline levels of LDL‐C, HDL cholesterol (HDL‐C) or triglycerides  32 . The starting dose of evolocumab for adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia or mixed dyslipidaemia is also based on clinical trial data and is either 140 mg Q2W or 420 mg Q4W; the two doses are clinically equivalent  20 ,  33 ,  34 ,  35 . For those with HoFH, 420 mg Q4W is recommended initially, with up‐titration to 420 mg Q2W if a clinically meaningful response is not achieved after 12 weeks  20 . Pooled analyses of Phase 2 data showed that the approved dosing regimens of alirocumab  36  and evolocumab  37  were not associated with any discernible adverse event (AE) signal. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the available data from Phase 3 studies that evaluated the efficacy and safety of anti‐PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies in patients with elevated LDL‐C levels. Methods Literature search Embase and PubMed databases were searched to identify English‐language Phase 3 studies of anti‐PCSK9 antibodies in patients with elevated LDL‐C, published from 1 January 2005 to 20 October 2015. We also searched abstracts books published from 16 November 2012 to 16 November 2015 from the International Symposium on Atherosclerosis and annual congresses of the following societies: American College of Cardiology, American Diabetes Association, American Heart Association, European Atherosclerosis Society, European Association for the Study of Diabetes, European Society of Cardiology and the National Lipid Association. Complete search strings are listed in  Supporting Information File S1. 
 Inclusion and exclusion criteria For inclusion, studies had to have enrolled patients with elevated baseline LDL‐C concentrations (according to their CV risk) into a Phase 3 trial of an anti‐PCSK9 antibody and reported data on LDL‐C. All Phase 3 studies (including randomized controlled trials, randomized trials, non‐randomized trials, single‐arm studies and pooled analyses that reported Phase 3 trial data separately) were included. Reports of pooled Phase 2 and Phase 3 safety data for subgroups not covered in reports of Phase 3 studies were also included.  In vitro  studies, animal studies and any other preclinical studies were excluded, as were editorials, letters, case reports, commentaries, interview‐based research, legal cases, newspaper articles, debates, general or independent central reviews, opinions, protocols, workshops, assay studies, cytogenetic studies, surgical studies and educational material for patients. Publications containing no unique data (for example, where the results of a clinical study were reported in multiple publications) were also excluded. Screening and data extraction The systematic review process complied with the 2009 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines  38 . The abstracts of publications identified in the initial search were screened independently by two authors to ascertain whether they met the predefined inclusion criteria. The full texts of all publications that were deemed potentially eligible for inclusion were reviewed independently by the two authors to confirm their eligibility. Conflicts between the authors would have been resolved by a third author but this was not necessary. Data were extracted from full‐text publications, where available. Data extraction Data on patient demographics and disease characteristics, outcomes and safety for patients receiving treatment with anti‐PCSK9 antibodies, and the methodology and timings used to evaluate LDL‐C levels, were extracted. Results Systematic literature search Once duplicates were removed, the searches of the Embase and PubMed databases returned 979 results (Figure  1 ), 930 of which were excluded at the title/abstract screening stage. The main reasons for exclusion were papers not describing original data (409 records) or not describing data on anti‐PCSK9 antibodies (246). Of the 49 records selected for full‐text evaluation, 28 were excluded. The most common reason for exclusion at this stage was article type (e.g. letter or commentary). At the data extraction stage, four further records were excluded because they were found to contain data duplicating other included articles  39 ,  40 ,  41 ,  42 . Seventeen records fulfilled the criteria for inclusion. The congress abstract search identified 909 abstracts, 19 of which were selected for inclusion. We also identified five relevant articles that were indexed in PubMed shortly after the search was completed  43 ,  44 ,  45 ,  46 ,  47 . These were included at the data extraction stage, replacing two congress abstracts presenting the same data  48 ,  49 . Figure 1 PRISMA flow diagram. PCSK9, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9; PRISMA, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses The 39 records that were included in the review described 12 Phase 3 studies of alirocumab and nine Phase 3 studies of evolocumab, involving more than 10 000 patients overall (Table  1 ), and 15 pooled analyses of efficacy from Phase 3 studies or pooled analyses of safety from Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies. Table  2  summarizes the study populations, including CV risk at baseline. No head to head studies were conducted between alirocumab and evolocumab.

 Patients who completed one of the parent studies could enrol, providing they had not discontinued treatment owing to an AE, had stable disease and were not expected to require dose adjustments or unblended lipid measurements Risk assessed according to parent trial Various a Data published in congress abstracts b Although the TAUSSIG study enrolled patients with severe hypercholesterolaemia, including those with HeFH, the data included in this systematic review are only from patients with HoFH c Study ongoing ATP, Adult Treatment Panel; CHD, coronary heart disease; CV, cardiovascular; CVD, cardiovascular disease; ESC/EAS, European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society; FH, familial hypercholesterolaemia; HeFH, heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia; HoFH, homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia; LDL‐C, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol; NCEP, National Cholesterol Education Program; SAMS, statin‐associated muscle symptoms; SCORE, European Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation; WHO, World Health Organization. LDL‐C concentrations are presented in mmol l –1  and mg dl −1 ; where the publication provided only concentrations in either mg dl −1  or mmol l –1 , a conversion factor of 38.67 was used (i.e. mg dl −1 /38.67 = concentration in mmol l –1 )  97 . For the purposes of this review, we assumed that patients with HeFH had a high CV risk and those with HoFH had a very high CV risk. LDL‐C concentrations were largely measured at week 24 in the alirocumab studies (with earlier interim measurements in some studies) but at week 12 in the evolocumab studies, with some also measuring LDL‐C concentrations at weeks 10, 24 and 52. The assays and their schedules are listed in Table  3 . Table 3 Assays used in studies of effect of anti‐PCSK9 antibodies on LDL‐C levels in patients with hypercholesterolaemia

 Week 12 mean standard‐of‐care‐corrected LDL‐C reduction Evolocumab, −64% Not reported a Goal defined as LDL‐C &lt; 70 mg dl −1  for all patients b Data reported in congress abstracts c Study ongoing ATP, Adult Treatment Panel; LDL‐C, LDL cholesterol; NCEP, National Cholesterol Education Program; QD, daily; QM, monthly; Q2W, every 2 weeks; Q4W, every 4 weeks. The majority of studies reported efficacy according to achievement of LDL‐C goal (Table  5  and Figure  2 ). Generally, rates of goal achievement were highest when anti‐PCSK9 antibodies were used in combination with statins and when baseline LDL‐C was low. Across the alirocumab–statin combination studies, the highest rate of LDL‐C goal achievement (87%) was in the subset of patients from the OPTIONS I study, who received alirocumab with atorvastatin 20 mg  50 . The lowest rate (64%) was in the alirocumab 150 mg Q4W arm of the ODYSSEY CHOICE II study, in which one‐third of patients were not receiving concomitant lipid‐lowering therapy  51 . All of these alirocumab combination studies included patients with high or very high CV risk. In studies of patients receiving evolocumab in combination with statins, rates for LDL‐C goal achievement were highest (98%) in the YUKAWA‐2 study  44  and lowest in the GAUSS‐2 study  52 . Overall, LDL‐C goals were achieved by 46% of the 140 mg Q2W group and 42% of the 420 mg Q4W group of GAUSS‐2; however, patients were statin‐intolerant, with high LDL‐C at baseline (5.0 mmol l –1  [193 mg dl –1 ]) and nearly two‐thirds of patients were not receiving concomitant lipid‐lowering therapy at baseline  52 . The DESCARTES and GAUSS‐2 trials showed that evolocumab was effective across patients with high, moderately high, moderate and low CV risk according to the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III classification  52 ,  53 . The highest rates for LDL‐C goal achievement in DESCARTES (90% with evolocumab plus 10 mg atorvastatin; 84% with evolocumab monotherapy) were in the groups with the lowest proportion of high‐risk individuals (10% and 5%, respectively); however, over two‐thirds of patients in the subgroup with the greatest proportion of high‐risk patients (64% were high‐risk in the subgroup of patients who received evolocumab plus 80 mg atorvastatin and 10 mg ezetimibe) also achieved their LDL‐C goal  53 . Figure 2 LDL‐C goal achievement according to baseline LDL‐C level. HeFH, heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia; LDL‐C, LDL cholesterol. Figure includes only studies that reported LDL‐C goal achievement. LDL‐C levels in mg dl −1  are converted to mmol l –1  by dividing by 38.67  97 
 The proportions of patients receiving monotherapy who achieved their LDL‐C goal ranged from 42%, which was observed in the ODYSSEY ALTERNATIVE study of alirocumab monotherapy in patients with moderate–very high CV risk and statin intolerance to 84% in the subgroup receiving evolocumab monotherapy in DESCARTES (of whom 5% had high CV risk defined using the NCEP ATP III classification)  45 ,  53 . The difference in baseline LDL‐C levels may have influenced this difference in outcomes: mean baseline LDL‐C was 4.9 mmol l –1  (191 mg dl −1 ) in the ODYSSEY ALTERNATIVE study and 2.7 mmol l –1  (104 mg dl −1 ) in DESCARTES. Four studies did not report the proportion of patients who achieved their LDL‐C goal  33 ,  34 ,  47 ,  54 ,  55 . ODYSSEY CHOICE I showed that the mean reduction in LDL‐C was greater than 50%  55 . Patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia All the multi‐arm studies showed a significant reduction in LDL‐C with the anti‐PCSK9 antibody being investigated  vs.  the comparator (Table  5 ). The ODYSSEY FH studies of alirocumab in combination with statins enrolled patients with HeFH. Mean placebo‐corrected LDL‐C reductions of 51–58% were observed, with 72–81% of patients achieving their LDL‐C goal  43 . In the ODYSSEY HIGH FH study, fewer patients (41%) met LDL‐C goals, probably reflecting the study inclusion requirement for patients to have severe HeFH (patients with LDL‐C ≥ 4.1 mmol l –1  [160 mg dl −1 ] despite maximally tolerated statin with or without lipid‐lowering therapy)  56 . In the ODYSSEY LONG TERM study of alirocumab, 17.7% of patients had HeFH  57 . Data were not reported according to the aetiology of hypercholesterolaemia, but the authors stated that the percentage change in LDL‐C was similar across subgroups. Overall, the calculated decrease in LDL‐C level from baseline to week 24 was 61.0% with alirocumab; 79% of patients achieved their LDL‐C goal (Table  5  and Figure  2 )  57 . In the RUTHERFORD‐2 study of evolocumab monotherapy in patients with HeFH, 68% of patients in the evolocumab 140 mg Q2W arm and 63% in the evolocumab 420 mg Q4W arm achieved their LDL‐C goal (Table  5  and Figure  2 )  58 . TESLA part B  34  and an interim subgroup analysis of TAUSSIG (itself a subgroup analysis of TESLA part B;  33 ,  47 ) both reported data for evolocumab in patients with HoFH (it should be noted that patients with HeFH and LDL‐C ≥ 3.4 mmol l –1  [130 mg dl −1 ] who had not been diagnosed with coronary heart disease [CHD] or CHD risk equivalents; or LDL‐C ≥ 2.6 mmol l –1  [100 mg dl −1 ] who had been diagnosed with CHD or CHD risk equivalent; or who were receiving apheresis  59 , were also included in these studies but data for those patients have not been reported). HoFH is a rare disease  60  and at the time of this review, there were no Phase 3 data for alirocumab in this population. The proportion of patients achieving their LDL‐C goal was not reported in either evolocumab study, and the mean LDL‐C reductions were less than 50% (decrease from baseline at week 12: TESLA part B, 23.1% with evolocumab  vs.  7.9% with placebo [ P  &lt; 0.0001]; TAUSSIG, 21% with evolocumab; Table  5 )  33 ,  34 ,  47 . Overall, the percentage reduction in LDL‐C was similar in patients with FH and those with non‐familial hypercholesterolaemia, although rates of goal achievement were lower in patients with FH. Efficacy across subgroups Patients with type 2 diabetes A pooled analysis of five placebo‐controlled Phase 3 alirocumab studies (ODYSSEY FH I and FH II, COMBO I, HIGH FH and LONG TERM) found that in patients with type 2 diabetes who received 75 mg alirocumab (up‐titration to 150 mg if required), least‐square mean LDL‐C changes from baseline to week 24 were 43.4% for those treated with alirocumab  vs.  0.3% for those who received placebo ( P  &lt; 0.001). In patients without type 2 diabetes, reductions were 49.8% and 5.1%, respectively ( P  &lt; 0.0001). The  P ‐value for the effect of diabetes on LDL‐C reduction was 0.02. Dose increase at week 12 was more common in patients without diabetes than in those with diabetes, which could explain these results; in patients from studies in which alirocumab was given at 150 mg from the start, type 2 diabetes had no significant effect on LDL‐C reduction  61 . A pooled analysis of data from the MENDEL‐2, LAPLACE‐2, RUTHERFORD‐2 and GAUSS‐2 evolocumab studies found that mean changes in LDL‐C in patients with type 2 diabetes ( n  = 417; 57–60% across dosing regimens) were similar to those in individuals without the disease ( n  = 2729; 61–62%). Goal achievement in patients with diabetes was high, with 87–88% of patients achieving LDL‐C levels below 1.8 mmol l –1  (70 mg dl −1 )  62 . A second pooled analysis of four Phase 3 trials also found that evolocumab reduced LDL‐C to a similar extent in patients with and without type 2 diabetes  63 . Other patient subgroups A pooled analysis of data from six alirocumab studies (ODYSSEY COMBO I and II, FH I and II, HIGH FH and LONG TERM) showed that alirocumab significantly reduced LDL‐C levels compared with controls, regardless of whether or not patients were also receiving high‐intensity statin treatment (atorvastatin 40–80 mg) and regardless of background lipid‐lowering treatment  64 . An analysis of the efficacy of alirocumab in patients with and without moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD) across ten Phase 3 trials found that, in the majority of studies, alirocumab significantly lowered LDL‐C by approximately 40–70%  vs.  the comparator treatment. The exception was the ALTERNATIVE trial, in which there was no significant reduction in LDL‐C with alirocumab  vs.  the control for patients with moderate CKD; however, patient numbers were small  65 . A pooled analysis of data from ten Phase 3 trials found that alirocumab was significantly better than the control in lowering LDL‐C levels, regardless of baseline triglyceride or HDL‐C concentrations  66 . Similarly, a pooled analysis of data from four Phase 3 studies found that evolocumab significantly reduced LDL‐C compared with the control in patients with high LDL‐C at baseline (≥4.1 mmol l –1  [159 mg dl −1 ] on statin treatment or ≥6.1 mmol l –1  [236 mg dl −1 ] not on statin)  67 . A pooled analysis of data from Phase 3 trials has shown that evolocumab substantially reduces LDL‐C regardless of baseline PCSK9 levels  68 . A pooled analysis of nine Phase 3 alirocumab studies, across which 20–65% of patients had previously experienced a myocardial infarction (MI) or ischaemic stroke, showed that there was no interaction between previous MI or stroke and LDL‐C reduction  69 . Finally, a pooled analysis of four Phase 3 studies found that evolocumab reduced LDL‐C regardless of age, gender, presence of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk level  63 . Adverse events In general, adverse event (AE) rates were similar in the active and control arms of both combination and monotherapy studies of patients with non‐familial hypercholesterolaemia (Table  6 ). The most common AEs across the alirocumab and evolocumab studies were musculoskeletal events, nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections. The patterns of these AEs in the alirocumab studies were mixed, with just three reporting increased rates of nasopharyngitis with alirocumab  vs.  control (ODYSSEY MONO, ODYSSEY COMBO I and ODYSSEY CHOICE II; the biggest across‐arm difference was reported in ODYSSEY MONO: 23.1% with alirocumab  vs.  15.7% with control)  40 ,  51 ,  70 . An increase in musculoskeletal events was only reported in ODYSSEY CHOICE II (24.1–28.7%  vs.  20.7%  51 ) and there was no clear signal that upper respiratory tract infection was more common with alirocumab than with controls.

The distribution of AEs in the evolocumab studies also varied across studies. A higher percentage of patients experienced musculoskeletal events, nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections in the evolocumab arms than in the control arms in the DESCARTES, RUTHERFORD‐2 and TESLA part B studies; the biggest difference in incidence of nasopharyngitis and musculoskeletal events were in RUTHERFORD‐2 (9%  vs.  5% and 5%  vs.  1%, respectively), while in both DESCARTES and TESLA part B, 9% of patients in the evolocumab arms experienced upper respiratory tract infections,  vs.  6% in the control arms  34 ,  53 ,  58 . However, in the other comparator studies in which these AEs were reported (MENDEL, LAPLACE, GAUSS‐2 and YUKAWA‐2), there were either no discernible differences in the frequencies of events across active and control arms, or higher incidences in the control arms than in the evolocumab arms  44 ,  52 ,  71 ,  72 . In several alirocumab studies, injection site reactions were more common in the active arms than in the comparator arms, with the largest incidences seen in ODYSSEY CHOICE I (incidences with alirocumab, 5.4–18.5% across arms  vs.  control, 5.7–8.3%) and ODYSSEY CHOICE II (alirocumab, 3.5 and 13.8% in the 75 mg Q2W and 150 mg Q4W arms, respectively,  vs.  control, 0%)  51 ,  55 . However, in ODYSSEY MONO, injection site reactions were less frequent in the alirocumab arm compared with the control (2%  vs.  4%) and, in OPTIONS I, rates were similar across arms (2–3%)  40 ,  50 . Across the evolocumab studies, the incidences of injection site reactions were similar in the active and control arms. Alirocumab studies in patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia also reported similar rates of AEs in the alirocumab and placebo arms  43 ,  56 . However, a pooled analysis of ODYSSEY studies (FH I and II, HIGH FH and LONG TERM [HeFH population]) found that injection‐site reactions were more common in the alirocumab arm than in the placebo arm (5.9% and 4.2%, respectively)  73 . In RUTHERFORD‐2 (which included only patients with HeFH), the incidences of AEs were 55 and 57% in the evolocumab arms and 43 and 55% in the placebo arms (Table  6 )  58 . In the TESLA part B study of patients with the rare genetic disease HoFH, the incidence of AEs was 36% in the evolocumab arm and 63% in the placebo arm (Table  6 )  34 . Serious adverse events, cardiac events, mortality and treatment discontinuation Serious AEs were rare in all studies (Table  6 ). The highest reported incidence of serious AEs was in ODYSSEY COMBO II and ODYSSEY LONG TERM (alirocumab 19%; ezetimibe 18%, placebo 20%)  57 ,  74 . In ODYSSEY LONG TERM, the authors noted that the serious AEs included allergic and neurologic AEs; however, numbers were small, with 0.5% and 0.4% of patients in the alirocumab and control arms, respectively, experiencing serious allergic AEs and 0.3% of patients in either arm experiencing serious neurologic AEs. No further details on serious AEs were given for ODYSSEY COMBO II. Few details of serious AEs were given in the evolocumab studies, apart from in DESCARTES. Of the 33 patients (5.5%) experiencing serious AEs in the evolocumab arm, only five AEs were experienced by more than one patient: angina pectoris, palpitations, ventricular extrasystoles, positional vertigo, back pain and pulmonary embolism (all two patients each; angina pectoris and pulmonary embolism also occurred in two patients and one patient, respectively, in the control arm)  53 . Major cardiac AEs were rare: the lowest reported incidence (0%) was seen in the control arms of OPTIONS I  50  and RUTHERFORD‐2  58 , the alirocumab arm of OPTIONS II  46  and the evolocumab arm of YUKAWA‐2  44 , and the highest was 5.1% in the placebo arm of ODYSSEY LONG TERM  57  (Table  6 ). Treatment discontinuations because of AEs were similarly rare (Table  6 ): the lowest rate was observed in YUKAWA‐2 (evolocumab 0%; placebo 0.5%) and the highest in ODYSSEY ALTERNATIVE (alirocumab 18%; control groups 25%)  44 ,  45 . The rates of treatment‐emergent AEs (TEAEs) leading to death were low in all studies; the highest incidences were reported in the control arm of OPTIONS I and the placebo arm of ODYSSEY COMBO I (2.0% and 2.8%, respectively)  50 ,  70 . Patient subgroups Pooled analyses of Phase 3 studies have found that there are no differences in the incidence of AEs in patients with diabetes  vs.  those without for evolocumab  62 . Similar results were seen in the alirocumab ODYSSEY LONG TERM study  75  and in a pooled analysis of alirocumab  61 , although patients with diabetes appeared less likely to experience injection‐site reactions than those without. Pooled analyses of Phase 3 alirocumab studies have also found that AE incidence is not impacted by baseline triglyceride or HDL‐C concentrations  66 , by whether or not patients had previously had an MI or stroke  69 , or by the presence or absence of CKD (although numerically higher treatment discontinuations were seen in patients with moderate CKD than in those without)  65 . Pooled safety data for patient subgroups from Phase 3 and Phase 2 studies show that the AE profile of evolocumab does not vary according to body weight  76  and that there are no noticeable differences in AE profiles when comparing patients aged 65 and older with those aged 75 and older  77 . Pooled Phase 2/3 analyses for alirocumab and evolocumab have shown that AEs are similar regardless of whether or not patients achieved very low LDL‐C levels (&lt;0.65 or &lt;0.39 mmol l –1  [&lt;25 mg dl −1  or &lt;15 mg dl −1 ] for alirocumab and &lt;1.0 mmol l –1  [&lt;40 mg dl −1 ] for evolocumab)  78 ,  79 . A pooled analysis of patients with statin intolerance from Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies of evolocumab found that safety signals in this subgroup were similar to those seen in previous analyses in broader populations  80 . Anti‐drug antibody production Anti‐drug antibody assessment was reported in six alirocumab and five evolocumab studies (Table  6 ). Pre‐existing immunoreactivity to alirocumab was evident in 0.7–3.2% of patients in the ODYSSEY COMBO I and OPTIONS I studies  50 ,  70 . In ODYSSEY COMBO I, 6.6% of patients had a treatment‐emergent positive response (i.e. developed antibodies to alirocumab following treatment) in the anti‐alirocumab antibody assay; however, in more than half of these patients, the antibodies were transient despite continued treatment with alirocumab. Four of the patients developed neutralizing antibodies, but these were transient and resolved within 24 weeks  70 . In OPTIONS I, anti‐drug antibody development was observed in five patients in the pooled alirocumab add‐on group, three of whom had persistent antibody responses and one of whom developed neutralizing antibodies  50 . In OPTIONS II, treatment‐emergent antibody development occurred in two patients; in one the response was transient and in the other it was indeterminate (i.e. it was only detected at the final sampling point); the antibodies did not appear to affect LDL‐C lowering  46 . In the alirocumab arms of the ODYSSEY FH studies, 6–9% of patients developed anti‐drug antibodies and 0.6% developed neutralizing antibodies  43 . In ODYSSEY MONO, six patients in the alirocumab arm (12%) developed anti‐drug antibodies, five of whom had a persistent response; however, neutralizing antibodies that could affect the pharmacokinetics, efficacy or safety of alirocumab were not detected  40 . Treatment‐emergent anti‐drug antibodies were not detected in patients in the evolocumab arms of DESCARTES, RUTHERFORD‐2 or TESLA part B  34 ,  53 ,  58 . In YUKAWA‐2 one patient developed an anti‐evolocumab antibody, and in LAPLACE‐2 three patients in the evolocumab group tested positive for anti‐drug antibodies before study drug administration, one of whom had detectable anti‐drug antibodies at the end of the study; neutralizing antibodies were not detected in any patient  44 ,  72 . Discussion The studies included in our systematic review show that the anti‐PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies alirocumab and evolocumab are well tolerated and effective in lowering LDL‐C, thereby helping patients with hypercholesterolaemia or mixed dyslipidaemia to achieve LDL‐C goals. Both alirocumab and evolocumab have been demonstrated to reduce LDL‐C goals across a broad patient population that encompassed a wide range of CV risk levels, and various comorbidities such as diabetes and CKD. We also noted an apparent inverse relationship between baseline LDL‐C and goal achievement, suggesting that these agents have a consistent effect that is independent of baseline LDL‐C levels. Statin intolerance may influence goal achievement, with the ODYSSEY ALTERNATIVE and GAUSS‐2 studies of patients with intolerance to statins reporting lower levels of goal achievement than other studies, but the data are still encouraging given the very high baseline LDL‐C concentrations in patients enrolled in these studies. For both alirocumab and evolocumab, rates of AEs, serious AEs and major cardiovascular AEs were similar to those in the respective control arms. The incidence of AEs was lower when alirocumab was used as a monotherapy than when it was used in combination with statins, which could reflect differences in the patient baseline characteristics: patients in the monotherapy study had a lower CV risk level than patients in the combination studies and would be expected to be receiving fewer concomitant medicines. In contrast to alirocumab, there was no discernible pattern in AE incidence according to whether evolocumab was used as a monotherapy or in combination with statins. Treatment‐emergent anti‐drug antibodies were also rare, but were reported in five alirocumab studies  40 ,  43 ,  46 ,  50 ,  70 ,  81 . The highest incidence of treatment‐emergent antibodies was reported in the alirocumab arm of the ODYSSEY MONO study (12%). An immune signal following alirocumab administration is also noted in the summary of product characteristics, which states that, in the Phase 3 programme, allergic reactions were more common in the alirocumab groups than in the control groups (8%  vs.  7%, respectively)  19 . A pooled safety analysis of nine placebo‐controlled Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies also found that the incidence of local injection‐site reactions was higher with alirocumab than with placebo (7%  vs.  5%), even though the incidence of AEs was generally similar across the alirocumab and placebo study arms  42 . In the evolocumab studies that investigated the presence of such antibodies, neutralizing treatment‐emergent anti‐drug antibodies were not detected, and treatment‐emergent binding antibodies were reported in just one patient (in the evolocumab arm of YUKAWA‐2)  44 . The anti‐drug antibody assays used were sensitive; several studies detected drug binding antibodies in patients who had not yet received evolocumab  34 ,  53 ,  72 . It should be noted, however, that different assays were used across the trials. Overall efficacy and safety are being further evaluated for all anti‐PCSK9 antibodies in ongoing long‐term Phase 3 studies. A combined analysis of two randomized open‐label extension studies (OSLER‐1 and ‐2) involving 4465 patients who completed one of 12 Phase 2 or 3 evolocumab studies (and consented to participate in an extension study with an initial re‐randomization after completion of the parent study) provides further relevant data that were not included in the safety section of our systematic review because it did not fulfil our inclusion criteria of including data for a patient subgroup not reported elsewhere  54 . This analysis also reported that no treatment‐emergent neutralizing anti‐drug antibodies were detected. Data on neurocognitive events will be of particular interest; OSLER‐1 and ‐2 reported that although overall rates of AEs were similar in the active and control study arms, patients who received evolocumab were more likely to experience neurocognitive events (0.9%  vs.  0.3% in the control arm)  54 . Similar data were seen for alirocumab in the ODYSSEY LONG TERM study (1.2%  vs.  0.5% in the control arm)  57 . The effect of anti‐PCSK9 antibodies on cognitive function is being investigated with a validated instrument (Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery) in the evolocumab EBBINGHAUS trial (NCT02207634), a sub‐analysis of a group of patients enrolled in the ongoing FOURIER study (NCT01764633  82 ), and will be monitored in other ongoing Phase 3 studies, such as the alirocumab ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study (NCT01663402). The meta‐analysis by Lipinksi  et al.  examined the effect of anti‐PCSK9 antibodies on lipids, but grouped data for alirocumab and evolocumab and did not examine the effects of these agents in different patient subgroups  83 . Other meta‐analyses and literature reviews have used CV events as efficacy/safety endpoints to compare studies, but data are currently very limited  84 ,  85 ,  86 ,  87 . In contrast, because LDL‐C reduction was the primary endpoint of the Phase 3 studies described here, the studies were statistically powered to assess the true efficacy of anti‐PCSK9 antibodies regarding LDL‐C lowering. Since completion of our systematic review, a meta‐analysis of randomized clinical trials investigating the efficacy of evolocumab in patients with or without type 2 diabetes has been published  88 . The analysis found that the LDL‐C‐lowering effect of evolocumab was consistent in patients with and without type 2 diabetes. Outcomes data in this and other patient subgroups are awaited with interest. Given that high LDL‐C is recognized as a major risk factor for CVD  5 ,  89 , we would expect the significant reductions in LDL‐C seen in these trials to translate into a reduction in CV events. ODYSSEY LONG TERM, which had the longest follow‐up of the alirocumab studies included in this review, reported promising data on major CV events, with significantly fewer events in the alirocumab group than in the placebo group (1.7%  vs.  3.3%;  P  = 0.02)  57 . A combined pre‐specified exploratory analysis of OSLER‐1 and ‐2 found that the rate of CV events at 1 year was significantly reduced with evolocumab compared with standard therapy (0.47%  vs.  2.2%;  P  = 0.003)  54 . Results from ongoing Phase 3 studies on CV outcomes, such as the alirocumab ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study, the evolocumab FOURIER study and the bococizumab SPIRE studies, are eagerly awaited  82 ,  90 ,  91 ,  92 . The results from this analysis should be interpreted in the context of the study limitations. First, cross‐trial comparisons should be made with caution because of the different methodologies used. For example, LDL‐C was measured at different time points after drug administration. The parameters used to define CV risk also differed across the trials, with some using the SCORE system (which estimates CV mortality risk using a combination of age, sex, blood pressure, smoking status and total cholesterol  93 ) and some using the NCEP ATP III classification (which defines high and very high CV risk as elevated LDL‐C in combination with other risk factors  94 ); one study used the Framingham coronary heart disease score  95 . Methodological differences among studies may be overcome to some extent by analysing the data according to patient group, because the standard of care within each group should be consistent. However, the baseline demographics of patients enrolled in the studies often varied considerably. Even when comparing studies using the same agents, caution is required; indeed, whereas most of the alirocumab studies used a starting dose of 75 mg Q2W, increasing to 150 mg Q2W only if the response at week 8 was insufficient, the ODYSSEY LONG TERM study had a starting dose of 150 mg Q2W. Secondly, when interpreting LDL‐C data, it is important to note that the Friedewald formula underestimates LDL‐C at low concentrations and so its use may overestimate the effect of anti‐PCSK9 antibodies  96 . Most of the included alirocumab studies used ultracentrifugation techniques if triglyceride concentrations exceeded 10.3 mmol l –1  (912 mg dl −1 ). Most evolocumab studies, however, also used ultracentrifugation if LDL‐C concentrations were less than 1.0 mmol l –1  (39 mg dl −1 ), as well as if patients had high triglyceride levels. Lastly, by limiting inclusion to published Phase 3 studies to ensure that only robust data were analysed, this review has analysed data for only two anti‐PCSK9 antibodies. Conclusions This systematic literature review provides a detailed overview of all available published Phase 3 data, in addition to pooled Phase 2/3 data for patient subgroups, for alirocumab and evolocumab, the two fully human anti‐PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies currently approved by the FDA and EMA. These drugs are being investigated further in two large study programmes, PROFICIO and ODYSSEY, respectively. Using anti‐PCSK9 antibodies as ‘add‐on’ therapy to statins or ezetimibe, or as monotherapy for patients unable to tolerate statins, will allow more patients to achieve their LDL‐C goal, with few AEs or treatment discontinuations. Clinical trials to investigate the effect of anti‐PCSK9 antibodies on CV events, and therefore their relevance in clinical practice, are currently underway, with results expected later this year.

 Introduction Edoxaban is a factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor  4 , approved in the USA for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolic events in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and a creatinine clearance ≤95 ml min –1 , and for the treatment of venous thromboembolic events  5 . Edoxaban has an oral bioavailability of 62%  6 . It is cleared through renal and nonrenal mechanisms, with each contributing equally to the total clearance in healthy subjects  7 . Nonrenal clearance includes metabolism and biliary secretion. Metabolism occurs through carboxylesterase 1 (CES‐1), cytochrome P450 3 A4 (CYP3A4), and nonenzymatic hydrolysis. The most abundant and active metabolite, M4, is formed by CES‐1 and is present in human plasma at &lt;10% of the total edoxaban exposure  7 . Edoxaban inhibits FXa with the half‐maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of 3 nmol l –1 . While the IC 50  of M4 is 1.8 nmol l –1 , it is not expected, in subjects with normal/moderate renal function, to contribute to the pharmacological effects of edoxaban, due to its low abundance and high protein binding (80%)  7 . The other circulating metabolites include M1 (inactive, formed via nonenzymatic hydrolysis) and M6 and M8 (both pharmacologically active). Both M6 and M8 are formed through CYP3A4 metabolism of edoxaban and are present in plasma in lower abundance than M4  7 . P‐glycoprotein (P‐gp) is a membrane transporter that is expressed in many tissues and/or cell types including intestinal epithelia, hepatocytes, kidney proximal tubules, and the blood–brain barrier  8 . In  vitro  experiments in human colon adenocarcinoma Caco‐2 cell monolayers expressing P‐gp revealed that edoxaban is transported via P‐gp and that this transport is strongly hindered by P‐gp inhibitors  9 . Edoxaban is not a substrate for uptake transporters such as organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP1B1), organic anion transporters (OAT1 and OAT3), or organic cation transporter (OCT2)  3 ,  9 . However, the metabolite M4 is a substrate for OATP1B1. Of note, cyclosporine additionally inhibits the uptake transporter, OATP1B1  10 . Based on  in vitro  data, it cannot be excluded that drugs that inhibit both P‐gp and CYP3A4 may affect the pharmacokinetics of edoxaban via both pathways. We have conducted clinical drug interaction studies with drugs that are dual inhibitors of P‐gp and CYP3A4 and have varying degrees of CYP3A4 inhibitory activity, with ketoconazole being a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, erythromycin a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, and cyclosporine a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor  11 ,  12 . P‐gp, being a pump, does not have a similar classification, although variability in response has been observed, probably due to heterogeneity in expression than potency of an inhibitor  13 ,  14 . These studies were designed to delineate the relative contribution of P‐gp  vs.  CYP3A4 in the drug interactions with ketoconazole, erythromycin, and cyclosporine, as well as to characterise the overall magnitude of the interaction. 
 Methods 
 Subject eligibility Subjects were eligible for the studies if they were aged between 18 and 45 years, had a body mass index (BMI) between 18 kg m –2  and 32 kg m –2 , and were of nonchildbearing potential or using nonhormonal methods of contraception. Subjects were excluded if they used any prescribed or nonprescribed medication, used topical medication or herbal supplements, had taken St John's wort 30 days prior to day 1 of the study, used strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP enzymes 28 days prior to day 1 of the study, had a creatinine clearance &lt;80 ml min –1 , were known to be sensitive to any of the products administered during dosing, or were otherwise judged unsuitable to participate in the study. All subjects provided signed informed consent prior to enrolment. Study design Each of the three studies was an open‐label, randomised, two‐period, two‐treatment crossover study in healthy subjects. Each treatment period was separated by a washout period of at least 14 days for cyclosporine and ketoconazole and at least 7 days for erythromycin (Figure  1 ). All studies were approved by relevant Institutional Review Boards and the Edinburgh Independent Ethics Committee for Medical Research and were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines. Figure 1 Study design. (A) Ketoconazole, (B) erythromycin, (C) cyclosporine The primary objective of these studies was the comparison of the pharmacokinetic parameters of edoxaban alone and when coadministered with ketoconazole, erythromycin, or cyclosporine. Secondary endpoints included change from baseline in prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) in the ketoconazole and erythromycin studies, inhibition of intrinsic factor X activity in the ketoconazole and cyclosporine studies, and assessments of safety and tolerability in all studies. Serial blood samples for analysis of plasma concentration of edoxaban and its metabolites were collected for 96 h in the ketoconazole study and for 72 h in the erythromycin and cyclosporine studies. A few blood samples were also collected to measure inhibiting drug levels to ensure adequate and expected concentrations. Samples for biomarkers of coagulation were collected at baseline, for 24 h after edoxaban dosing in the ketoconazole and erythromycin studies, and over 72 h postdose in the cyclosporine study. Ketoconazole This study was conducted at MDS Pharma Services (Neptune, NJ, USA). Subjects were randomised to receive a single oral dose of edoxaban alone or an oral dose of ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 7 days with concomitant dosing of edoxaban 60 mg and ketoconazole 400 mg on day 4 (Figure  1  A). Subjects were instructed to abstain from red meat and vitamin C in excess of 250 mg day –1  for the duration of the study to avoid a false positive reading for faecal occult blood. Morning study drug doses were administered following a 10‐h fast. Water was not permitted for a 1‐h period prior to dosing and a 1‐h period after dosing, with the exception of 240 ml administered with treatments; water was not restricted at any other time. Sample size was determined based on the assumption of a geometric coefficient of variation for a maximum plasma concentration (C max ) of 33.0 ng ml –1  and a minor effect (ratio &lt;1.05) of ketoconazole on edoxaban pharmacokinetics. A sample size of 32 subjects was required to provide 85% power to conclude the absence of effect of ketoconazole for a 90% confidence interval (CI) no‐effect boundaries of 80–125%. A total of 40 subjects were enrolled to compensate for potential dropouts. Erythromycin The study was performed at MDS Pharma Services (Belfast, UK). Subjects were randomised to receive oral erythromycin 500 mg four times daily for 8 days along with a single oral dose of edoxaban 60 mg on day 7, and, in the next treatment sequence, subjects received a single oral dose of edoxaban 60 mg without erythromycin on day 1. Each subject participated in each treatment period once and received edoxaban on two occasions, with and without erythromycin (Figure  1 B). Subjects were required to fast overnight for at least 10 h prior to edoxaban dosing and for at least 4 h afterwards. Erythromycin was administered four times daily with 240 ml of water. Doses were given with a meal or snack on days 1–8, with the exception of doses given during the 10‐h interval prior to edoxaban dosing. A sample size of 28 subjects was required to provide at least 80% power to conclude an absence of effect of erythromycin on edoxaban pharmacokinetics using a 90% CI with no‐effect boundaries of 80–125%. A total of 36 subjects were enrolled to compensate for potential dropouts. Cyclosporine This study was conducted at MDS Pharma Services (Neptune, NJ, USA). Subjects were randomised to receive either a single oral dose of edoxaban 60 mg concomitant with a single oral dose of cyclosporine 500 mg or a single oral dose of edoxaban 60 mg. Each subject participated in each treatment period once and received edoxaban on two occasions, with and without cyclosporine (Figure  1 C). Drugs were administered following a 10‐h fast, and no food was allowed for 4 h after drug administration. Water was not permitted during the hour before and the hour following dosing, with the exception of 240 ml administered with dosing; water was allowed at all other times. A sample size of 28 subjects provided at least 80% power to conclude an absence of effect of cyclosporine on edoxaban pharmacokinetics using a 90% CI with no‐effect boundaries of 80–125%. A total of 34 subjects were enrolled to compensate for potential dropouts. Bioanalytical methods Plasma concentrations were analysed using validated assays employing liquid chromatographic separation followed by tandem mass spectrometric detection methods. Plasma concentrations of edoxaban and M4 in all three studies were analysed at Advion BioServices (Ithaca, NY, USA). The assay performance was linear within a concentration range of 0.764–382 ng ml –1  for edoxaban (intra‐assay coefficient of variation [CV] ≤11.0%, interassay CV ≤8%), and 0.0792–7.92 ng ml –1  for M4 (intra‐assay CV ≤12.3%, interassay CV ≤11.5%). Metabolites M1, M6, and M8 were assessed only in the ketoconazole study. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for the detection of M1, M6, and M8 in plasma using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry was 0.100 ng ml –1 , and the assay range was 0.100–5.00 ng ml –1 . Ketoconazole concentration was analysed by Advion BioServices (Ithaca, NY, USA) within the concentration range of 0.10–20.0 μg ml –1 . Erythromycin was analysed within the range of 10–10 000 ng ml –1  at Bioanalytical Systems, Inc. (West Lafayette, IN, USA). Whole blood cyclosporine concentrations were measured by Covance Bioanalytical Services (Indianapolis, IN, USA), with an LLOQ of 5 ng ml –1 . Clinical laboratory assessments In the ketoconazole study, PT measurements were performed using Thromborel S and the Dade Behring technique. Prothrombin time and aPTT were assessed in the ketoconazole and erythromycin studies and analysed by Biomnis (formerly Laboratoire LCL; Ivry‐sur‐Seine, France), and MDS Pharma Services, respectively. Prothrombin time and aPTT were not assessed in the cyclosporine study. Blood samples for the determination of FXa activity were analysed using a chromogenic method by Biomnis in the ketoconazole study and by Medpace Reference Laboratories (Cincinnati, OH, USA) in the cyclosporine study. Intrinsic FXa activity was not assessed in the erythromycin study. Clinical laboratory analyses of haematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis parameters were performed at MDS Pharma Services. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses Plasma concentration–time data were analysed by noncompartmental methods using WinNonlin Professional Software (versions 4.0 or higher). The following parameters were estimated: maximum (peak) observed concentration in plasma (C max ), time from dosing to the maximum (peak) observed concentration in plasma (t max ), area under the concentration‐time curve from time extrapolated to infinity (AUC), apparent terminal elimination half‐life (t 1/2 ), and apparent clearance from plasma after oral administration (CL/F). For statistical analysis of exposure parameters (C max , AUC), an analysis of variance was performed on log‐transformed values using sequence treatment and period as fixed effects, and subject nested within sequence as a random effect, using SAS ®  Proc Mixed. Absence of an effect of ketoconazole, erythromycin, or cyclosporine was concluded if the 90% CIs about the geometric least squares means ratios were contained within the interval of 80–125%. Nonparametric statistical analysis was performed using the Hodges–Lehmann estimator for differences in median values, and the Moses method was used to construct 90% CIs for t max  and t 1/2  for edoxaban and its metabolites. For assessment of pharmacodynamics, the following parameters were estimated using noncompartmental methods: maximum observed activity (A max ), change from baseline in A max  value (∆A max ), and percent change from baseline in A max  value (%∆A max ) . 
 Safety analysis Safety was assessed by adverse events monitored continuously throughout the study. Clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, 12‐lead electrocardiograms, physical examinations, and faecal occult blood tests were assessed at baseline, at scheduled times after dosing of the inhibitor, several times during the day when edoxaban was coadministered from time 0 to 24‐h postdose, and at the end of study. Data were summarised by descriptive statistics. 
 Results 
 Ketoconazole A total of 40 subjects (35 men, 5 women) with a mean age of 30.9 years (range 20–45 years) and BMI ranging from 19.9 kg m –2  to 31.8 kg m –2  were enrolled in the study. There were 25 African Americans, 13 Caucasians, one Asian, and one American Indian/Alaskan. In total, 37 subjects completed both study periods. Administration of edoxaban with ketoconazole increased both mean peak and total exposure of edoxaban by approximately 89% and 87%, respectively (Figure  2 A; Table  1 ). The median time to peak concentration increased by about 30 min, while the terminal elimination half‐life was similar. The mean apparent oral clearance decreased from 38.9 l h –1  to 20.8 l h –1  (Table  1 ).

 n  = 37 Exposure to the metabolite M4 was higher when edoxaban was coadministered with ketoconazole, with approximately 56% and 46% higher peak and total exposures, respectively (Figure  2 B). The mean terminal half‐life remained the same for both treatments. This increase in exposure for M4 could be the result of increased bioavailability of edoxaban as the metabolite‐to‐parent drug ratio (± standard deviation [SD]) remained similar (7.85 ± 2.21 for edoxaban dosed alone  vs.  6.30 ± 1.63 for edoxaban dosed with ketoconazole). The average peak and total exposure for the metabolite M1 increased by 84% and 80%, respectively, with no change in mean terminal half‐life (Table  1 ). This increase is also consistent with the increased bioavailability of edoxaban in the presence of ketoconazole, as there was no change in the metabolite‐to‐parent drug ratio. On average, the peak and total exposure to the metabolite M6 decreased by 51% and 43%, respectively (Table  1 ). The metabolite‐to‐parent drug ratio decreased from 4.44 ± 1.18 to 1.45 ± 0.49, indicating the inhibitory effect of ketoconazole on CYP3A4, which mediates the formation of M6. Most concentrations of M8 were below the limit of quantification or close to the limit of quantification (0.100 ng ml –1 ); hence, pharmacokinetic parameters were not calculated for this metabolite. Nevertheless, as expected for a metabolite formed by CYP3A4, the detectable concentrations of M8 were lower when administered with ketoconazole. The maximum percent change from baseline (SD) for PT and aPTT with ketoconazole (56.7% [15.5] and 50.3% [11.7], respectively) was greater than for edoxaban alone (31.8% [13.2] and 32.6% [8.0], respectively). The mean value of intrinsic FX inhibition was also increased for coadministration of edoxaban and ketoconazole (109.4%) compared with edoxaban alone (101.3%). These results were consistent with increased plasma concentrations following coadministration of edoxaban and ketoconazole  7 . Erythromycin A total of 36 subjects were enrolled, and 33 completed the study. Three subjects discontinued due to adverse events related to erythromycin dosing. The enrolled subjects included 26 men and 10 women with a BMI range of 19.0–30.0 kg m –2 . All subjects were Caucasian with a mean age of 25.3 years (range 18–45 years). Coadministration with erythromycin resulted in an increase in both peak and total exposure of edoxaban, with no change in median t max.  (Figure  3 A, Table  2 ). The peak and total exposure of edoxaban administered with erythromycin were approximately 68% and 85% higher, respectively, compared with edoxaban administered alone. Similarly, the peak and total exposure of M4 were approximately 75% and 78% higher, respectively, when administered with erythromycin (Figure  3 B, Table  2 ). Erythromycin decreased the total apparent clearance by about 47% with no change in the formation of the M4 metabolite, as the metabolite‐to‐parent drug ratio remained similar (11.9 ± 2.72 for edoxaban dosed alone  vs.  11.3 ± 3.40 for edoxaban dosed with erythromycin).

 n  = 32 The maximum mean (± SD) observed activity for PT was greater when edoxaban was coadministered with erythromycin (16.1 ± 2.7 s) compared with edoxaban administration alone (13.8 ± 1.3 s). The maximum percent change from baseline (SD) in PT was 44.9% (21.6) for edoxaban coadministered with erythromycin compared with 24.8% (9.2) for edoxaban alone. Similarly, the maximum mean (± SD) observed activity for aPTT was greater when edoxaban was coadministered with erythromycin (41.5 ± 6.6 s  vs.  35.9 ± 4.3 s), and the corresponding percent mean maximum change from baseline (SD) was 59.8% (22.8), compared with 37.5% (12.9) for edoxaban alone. The prolongation of PT and aPTT was consistent with the increased mean peak plasma concentrations of edoxaban, coadministered with erythromycin. Cyclosporine A total of 34 subjects were enrolled and 31 subjects completed the study. Of the subjects enrolled, 23 were African American, 10 Caucasian, and one of  other  race. The majority were men (23 men, 11 women). The mean age was 32.9 years, ranging from 18 years to 44 years, and BMI range was 21.2–32.0 kg m –2 . Single‐dose edoxaban peak and total exposure increased when edoxaban was coadministered with cyclosporine (Table  3 ; Figure  4 A). Based on geometric least squares mean ratios, the increase was 73% and 74% (approximately 1.7‐fold) for total and peak exposure, respectively. The increase in the peak and total exposure of the human specific metabolite M4 was more pronounced, with 8.7‐ and 6.9‐fold increase in peak and total exposure, respectively, when edoxaban was coadministered with cyclosporine (Figure  4 B, Table  3 ). The metabolite‐to‐parent drug ratio increased substantially from 9.5 ± 2.90 for edoxaban dosed alone  vs.  35.9 ± 8.35 for edoxaban dosed with cyclosporine.

These data are consistent with the increase in plasma concentrations of edoxaban when coadministered with cyclosporine. Safety Edoxaban was well tolerated in all studies, both when administered alone or in combination with ketoconazole, erythromycin, or cyclosporine. No serious adverse events were reported. The detailed description of the safety results is included in the  Supporting Information (Appendix S1) . 
 Discussion 
 The effect of dual P‐gp/CYP3A4 inhibitors ketoconazole, erythromycin, and cyclosporine on edoxaban pharmacokinetics was evaluated in three individual studies. Each of these inhibitors had a different extent of CYP3A4 inhibitory potential, but all of them are known P‐gp inhibitors  9 . Each drug had a slightly different effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of edoxaban. All three drugs increased the exposure (C max  and AUC, respectively) of edoxaban: ketoconazole (89% and 87%), erythromycin (68% and 85%), and cyclosporine (74% and 73%). The metabolites M6 and M8, formed by CYP3A4, were measured in the ketoconazole study to confirm the relative contribution of CYP3A4 inhibition on the increased edoxaban exposure. The CYP3A4 effects of the ketoconazole were observed in the four‐fold decrease in exposure of M6. Although levels of M8 were generally below the quantification limit, the concentration of M8, when detectable, was lower when administered with ketoconazole, indicating CYP3A4 inhibition. Since metabolism via CYP3A4 is a minor pathway for edoxaban (&lt;4% of total clearance)  7 , and M6 and M8 have a low relative abundance in plasma, these metabolites were not measured in studies with erythromycin and cyclosporine. Results of prior drug interaction studies conducted with the P‐gp inhibitor quinidine and edoxaban dosed intravenously and orally indicate that the predominant mechanism for the increased edoxaban exposure by ketoconazole, erythromycin, and cyclosporine is mediated by the inhibition of gut P‐gp.  6 ,  15 . With intravenous dosing of edoxaban, the increase in total exposure was only about 35%, whereas for oral edoxaban, the increase in exposure was about 68%  6 . The results from our study also support this assertion. Thus, it can be concluded that P‐gp inhibition in the gut is the predominant mechanism for drug interaction with edoxaban, and drugs that are inhibitors of CYP3A4 alone are unlikely to affect the edoxaban pharmacokinetics appreciably. In addition, results of the three studies described in this report provide further mechanistic insight into the distribution and elimination of edoxaban and its metabolites. For example, the ketoconazole interaction study shows the increase in total exposure cannot be fully accounted for by an increase in bioavailability alone, since the absolute bioavailability of edoxaban is 62%  6 . Despite a minimal change in terminal half‐life, it appears that both clearance and volume of distribution changed by a similar magnitude, approximately 46%. Thus, ketoconazole appears to reduce both the clearance and volume of distribution of edoxaban in addition to increasing bioavailability by reducing intestinal P‐gp‐mediated efflux. However, the full effect of decreased clearance is probably underestimated from this study due to concomitant change in the volume parameter or inadequate sampling scheme. Since the half‐life of edoxaban is about 11.5 h, sampling should occur for about 60 h to characterize the terminal phase/clearance adequately. Collecting samples for shorter duration will, consequently, estimate the terminal phase and associated parameters inaccurately. With erythromycin, the half‐life of edoxaban decreased with decreased clearance, in addition to an increase in bioavailability related to P‐gp inhibition in the gut. The approximate 47% decrease in apparent clearance was accompanied by a 63% decrease in apparent volume of distribution. This effect is consistent with published literature  16 . When edoxaban was administered with cyclosporine, the half‐life did not change appreciably, but the apparent clearance was almost half that of edoxaban dosed alone. Thus, the decrease in apparent clearance was probably balanced by a decrease in apparent volume of distribution, half‐life being a ratio of these two parameters. Given the decreases in both apparent clearance and volume of distribution, these data suggest that bioavailability increased, owing to inhibition of P‐gp in the gut by cyclosporine. The relative exposure of the M4 metabolite with respect to the parent drug did not change when edoxaban was administered with ketoconazole or erythromycin, but increased substantially with cyclosporine. Since cyclosporine also inhibits OATP1B1  10 , the disproportionate increase in exposure for M4 was postulated to be due to inhibition of OATP1B1. A drug‐interaction study with rifampin, an OATP1B1 inhibitor, also showed a similar increase in M4 exposure. Later  in vitro  studies confirmed that M4 is a substrate of OATP1B1  9 . The M1 metabolite is formed by nonenzymatic hydrolysis  7 . Administration of ketoconazole, a P‐gp/CYP3A4 inhibitor, did not affect its relative abundance. M1 was not measured in other studies due to low circulating concentrations; it is inactive and not affected by coadministration of P‐gp/CYP3A4 inhibitors. 
 In vitro  data show that M4, the most abundant metabolite, possesses comparable inhibitory activity of human FXa to edoxaban  17 . However, the pharmacodynamic effects observed in this study were mostly consistent with exposure to edoxaban. Given the limited exposure to metabolites, with and without P‐gp inhibitors, the contribution of M4 or other less abundant metabolites to clinical efficacy or safety in most subjects is expected to be limited. A single dose of edoxaban was well tolerated in healthy subjects when administered alone or in combination with ketoconazole, erythromycin, or cyclosporine. No unexpected or clinically concerning pattern of adverse experiences was noted. Overall, results from the three studies demonstrate that CYP3A4 plays a minor role in the clearance of edoxaban in healthy subjects. Thus, inhibitors of CYP3A4 alone are unlikely to affect the exposure of edoxaban appreciably. The exposure of edoxaban is influenced by the activity of P‐gp as it is involved in limiting absorption and modulating distribution. Thus, inhibitors of P‐gp are expected to increase the exposure of edoxaban. As observed in these studies, P‐gp inhibitors with varying degree of CYP3A4 inhibition increased edoxaban exposure, but the increase was less than two‐fold.

    <Body>WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT The Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), formerly known as the General Practice Research Database (GPRD), is being increasingly used to investigate suicide-related adverse drug reactions, although no previous studies have comprehensively validated the recording of suicide and nonfatal self-harm in the CPRD. Recent linkages of CPRD General Practices with Office for National Statistics mortality data and Hospital Episode Statistics data provide new opportunities for validation. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS Use of diagnostic codes (‘Read codes’) recorded by general practitioners for suicide identification has low sensitivity and positive predictive value compared with Office for National Statistics-confirmed suicides obtained by record linkage (the gold standard). Approximately 31.6% of hospital-admitted cases of self-harm are not recorded in the CPRD. Compared with estimates derived from registers of hospital attendance for self-harm, CPRD underestimates the incidence of self-harm by approximately 54.5%. The lack of a gold standard for nonfatal self-harm makes it difficult to validate this outcome fully. Introduction Large primary care databases, such as the Clinical Practice Research Datalink [CPRD ( http://www.cprd.com ); formerly known as the General Practice Research Database (GPRD)] and The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database ( http://www.thin-uk.com ), are being increasingly used in epidemiological research  1 . These databases provide excellent opportunities for investigating the incidence and prevalence of diseases and for conducting pharmacoepidemiology, pharmacovigilance and health services research, because over 98% of people in the UK are registered with a general practitioner (GP), and almost all GPs use computerized records  2 . The value of primary care databases comes from their size (power) and ability to investigate drug use in the wider population outside of the often tightly controlled clinical environments of randomized controlled trials  3 . Whilst randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses are the preferred methods for evaluating drug therapies, they are usually only large enough to detect primary outcomes and common side effects. Rare end-points, such as suicide, are difficult to investigate using experimental studies, because the sample size requirements for such outcomes are prohibitively large  4 . In the last 15 years, several observational studies have used primary care databases to investigate drug safety issues for rare disease outcomes  5 – 10 . There are well-known limitations of using primary care databases for research. Given that the data are primarily collected for use in routine clinical practice, they may not be sufficiently accurate for research purposes. Lawrenson  et al .  2 , in their review of the use of general practice databases, described data accuracy in terms of validity (i.e. what is the likelihood that a patient with a diagnosis recorded on the database genuinely has that particular condition) and completeness or sensitivity (i.e. if a patient has been diagnosed as having diabetes, what is the likelihood that it would be recorded on the database). The recording of chronic conditions, such as diabetes, has a high sensitivity (&gt;90%), because chronic illnesses require regular follow-up  2 . With the introduction of the Quality and Outcomes Framework in 2004, it is likely that certain chronic conditions would be even better recorded; for instance, the recording of HbA 1c  for diabetes was 13% higher in 2005 than 2004  11 ,  12 . However, recording is likely to be lower for self-harm (which is not included in the Quality and Outcomes Framework) and major one-off events, such as suicide. Self-harm is one of the commonest reasons for attendance at hospital emergency departments  13 . Approximately 50% of patients who self-harm consult their GPs in the month after the episode  14 . However, one study found that in almost half of cases involving a mental health specialist, there was no communication with the individual's GP  15 . This may result in significant under-recording of self-harm on primary care databases if such incidents are not also routinely captured by GP information systems. Furthermore, cause of death may not be confirmed for many months after a death has occurred, because the average time taken to complete a coroner's inquest in England and Wales is over 6 months  16 . If GPs are not notified of the outcome of the inquest, cause of death may not be entered onto the electronic medical records. If under-reporting leads to differential misclassification of outcomes in the CPRD, then biased estimates of associations of suicide and self-harm and exposures may be obtained. To identify health outcomes of interest, CPRD researchers use algorithms based on combinations of specific codes used to record diagnoses, medications, referrals and hospital attendance. Although such approaches for detecting suicides have been validated using the THIN database, the studies were based on subsets of patients  17 ,  18 . The last review of the quality of suicide reporting in the CPRD was carried out over 15 years ago  19 ,  20 ; nonfatal self-harm has not been previously assessed in CPRD or THIN. The electronic medical records of some English CPRD practices have recently been linked with Office for National Statistics (ONS) mortality data and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). The ONS data (the gold standard) record suicides, while the HES data provide an opportunity to validate the recording of nonfatal self-harm in the CPRD, albeit limited to hospital-admitted cases. The aim of this paper is to validate the recording of self-harm and suicide using Read code algorithms in the CPRD. Specifically, we assess the reliability of these algorithms for the identification of cases of suicides and self-harm and compare our findings with the following: (i) national incidence rates; (ii) information obtained from recent linkages to ONS mortality data and HES; and (iii) free text searches of GP consultation records. Methods Ethics approval Ethics approval for this study was obtained from the MHRA's Independent Scientific Advisory Committee. Source data and population The CPRD contains electronic medical records from approximately 5.1 million active patients, representing about 8.3% of the UK population (based on the April 2011 release). Approximately 50% of CPRD general practices in England were recently linked with ONS mortality and HES data. The CPRD contains consultation, prescribing, referral and health outcome information for individual patients; this is entered by GPs and their staff onto computer systems  21 . These records are the primary administrative medical records used by the practices. Participating general practices use a computerized system called Vision, which includes built-in data-collection software. This software extracts data from practice computers, excludes personal data, such as names and addresses, and assigns anonymized patient and prescriber identification numbers. During a consultation, GPs can enter descriptions of patients' symptoms and diagnoses using either Read codes or written text. General practitioners select Read codes to indicate diagnoses or symptoms using automated drop-down lists of codes. Each Read code is linked to a specific phrase of text, which indicates a single diagnosis or symptom. Study population Patients were eligible for inclusion in this study if they were aged 15 years and over and were enrolled in a practice at any time from 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2010. This time period was chosen to coincide with the availability of HES and ONS linkage for English practices within the CPRD. To maximize quality and completeness, we restricted our analyses to data from the following sources. Patient records that had been classified as ‘acceptable’ by the CPRD; this means that certain quality criteria had been met, for example there were no breaks in the patient records and year of birth, and the patient's sex and first registration date were recorded. Practices that had been designated as ‘up to standard’ by the CPRD, i.e. the practice provided continuity in data recording, with exclusion of practices which did not sufficiently record whether patients had died or been transferred out of the practice. Other data sources Three other sources of data were used in this study, as follows. ONS data. The ONS produces annual reports on specific causes of death, including suicides in the UK  22 . The ONS mortality data, including date of death and causes of death, have been linked to approximately half of all English practices in the CPRD. HES. This is a secure data warehouse that contains details of all admissions to NHS hospitals in England only ( http://www.hesonline.nhs.uk ). Integrated HES data for 50% of CPRD practices are provided free of cost to CPRD users. Multicentre Study of Self-Harm. This study records all episodes of self-harm (including those not admitted to a hospital bed) presenting to hospital emergency departments in three centres, namely Oxford, Manchester and Derby  23 . Case identification Cases of suicide and self-harm (the ‘events’) were identified by extracting all records with Read codes for suicide, attempted suicide and self-harm (see Appendices 1 and 2). Given that suicide-related Read codes may refer to both fatal and nonfatal suicide attempts, completed suicides within the CPRD were identified using the conventional CPRD approach of linking patient deaths to Read codes for suicide that were recorded within 95 days of the CPRD-derived death dates (CPRD personal communication and  Appendix 2 ). Validation of cases We assessed the reliability of our Read code algorithms (see  Appendix 1 ) to identify cases of suicide and nonfatal self-harm using two approaches: We estimated age- and sex-specific incidence of suicide and nonfatal self-harm in the CPRD using events defined by Read codes from 1998 to 2010. We defined incidence as the patient's first ever event. We then compared these incidence rates to rates given in the ONS mortality statistics for the UK (for suicide) and self-harm registry data described in the Multicentre Study of Self-Harm (for nonfatal self-harm)  23 ,  24 . We compared the number of suicides and episodes of self-harm identified using algorithms based on Read codes with those retrieved using linked ONS mortality and HES data in the approximately 50% of general practices with ONS–HES linkage (England only). Cases of suicide (source, ONS mortality) and nonfatal self-harm (source, HES data) were identified by the following International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes; ICD 10: X60–X84 (intentional self-harm, which includes purposely self-inflicted poisoning or injury and attempted suicide) and Y10–Y34 (event of undetermined intent), excluding Y33.9 where verdict was still pending  25 ; ICD 9: E950–E959 (recorded suicides and self-inflicted injury) and E980–E989 (injury undetermined, whether accidentally or purposely inflicted), excluding E988.8. International Classification of Disease codes for undetermined deaths were included, because most of these deaths are probable suicides  26 . We calculated the sensitivity and positive predictive values (PPV) of our Read code algorithms for detecting suicide. We performed a sensitivity analysis for the CPRD-detected suicides using death dates within 30, 180 and 360 days of the suicide/self-harm Read code date. We could not use self-harm (as defined in HES) as the gold standard for self-harm, because only half of self-harm episodes that present to hospital are admitted  27 ,  28 ; therefore, we identified the percentage of those patients with self-harm records in HES who also had records indicating self-harm in the CPRD within 6 months of hospital admission. Free text searches To assess whether free text searches of GP consultation records might improve the identification of cases of suicide and self-harm that were not Read coded as such, we carried out free text searches of CPRD patient records for missed cases of HES-identified self-harm in 2010 and all missed cases of suicide from January 1998 to December 2010. We used the following search terms: suicid* (including suicide, suicidal, suicidality), overdose, depress* (including depression, depressed), self harm*(including self harming, self harmed), self injur* (including self injury, self injurious) and self poison* (including self poisoning). Statistical analyses We performed all analyses in Stata version 12 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). Rates were age standardized using the European Standard Population  29 . Incidence rates were calculated using mid-year population denominators from the ONS ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/pop-estimate/population-estimates-for-uk–england-and-wales–scotland-and-northern-ireland/population-estimates-timeseries-1971-to-current-year/index.html , accessed 7 February 2012). Results Suicide UK We identified 1214 male suicides and 553 female suicides using Read code algorithms in all eligible CPRD practices. The age-standardized suicide rates were 5.5 per 100 000 for males and 2.2 per 100 000 for females, whereas ONS suicide rates over the same time period were 18.5 per 100 000 for men and 5.7 per 100 000 for women. Figure  1  shows the trends in age-standardized, sex-specific suicide rates in the UK from 1998 to 2010 in those aged 15 years and over based on: (i) national ONS data; and (ii) using CPRD Read code algorithms. Suicide rates were underestimated using Read code algorithms for both men and women. Figure  2  shows the age- and sex-specific suicide rates based on CPRD Read code-defined suicides in 1998–2010 compared with national rates. Suicide rates were consistently higher in men than women using ONS and CPRD data; however, the age distribution of suicide rates using CPRD Read code algorithms was different from that observed using ONS data. Rates were highest in males and females aged over 75 years in the CPRD, whereas in the ONS men aged 15–44 years and women aged 45–74 years had the highest suicide rates.

We identified 1063 suicides using Read code algorithms in these linked practices; 590 of these [55.5%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 52.5–58.5%] were true, ONS-confirmed suicides (PPV). These 590 cases represented 26.1% (95% CI: 24.3–28.0%) of all the 2260 ONS-confirmed suicides (sensitivity). In a sensitivity analysis, when we increased the time period between the clinical event date and the CPRD-derived death date from 30 to 360 days, the sensitivity increased from 25.0 (95% CI: 23.2–26.8%) to 35.5% (95% CI: 33.5–37.5%), but the PPV decreased from 63.2 (95% CI: 59.9–66.3%) to 46.0% (95% CI: 43.6–48.3%). Table  1  shows age-, era- (before/after 2004) and sex-specific sensitivities and PPVs for Read code-identified suicides in the CPRD. There was little difference between the sensitivity and PPV by sex or era, although suicides amongst males had a lower sensitivity and higher PPV than females (the difference in sensitivity for males and females was consistent with chance  p  = 0.210). The PPV and sensitivity were somewhat better in more recent years. The Read code algorithms were most sensitive for 45–74 years old, but a considerably lower PPV was obtained for those aged over 75 years (25.4%, 95% CI: 19.3–32.4%).

Figure  3  shows the trends in age-standardized suicide rates in England as a whole, as well as for ONS-linked English practices in the CPRD, based on all suicides identified through the ONS linkage. Excluding 2010, suicide rates in ONS-linked practices followed a similar pattern to that for England as a whole, although rates in ONS-linked practices tended to be slightly lower.

Figure  4  shows the self-harm rates per 100 000 by sex for the year 2007 based on Read code algorithms. Female self-harm rates were consistently higher than male rates for all age groups, with the exception of those aged 85 years and older. The highest self-harm rates were seen in females aged 15–19 years and males aged 20–24 years. The age and sex distributions were similar to those seen in the HES data and the combined data from the three hospital registers in the Multicentre Study of Self Harm (Table  2 )  24 .

However, Read code algorithm-defined self-harm incidence rates were lower than those derived from self-harm hospital registry data, e.g. male rates at all ages were 148.6 per 100 000  vs.  317 per 100 000 based on the Multicentre Study register data. The lower rates derived from HES (see Table  2 ) reflect the fact that these are based on hospital admissions, whereas the Multicentre Study register data record all hospital-presenting cases of self-harm, regardless of whether or not they led to admission. Figure  5  compares the age- and sex-specific incidence of self-harm derived from HES with that based on Read code algorithms in 2007. The rates based on Read code algorithms were approximately twice the HES rates for men aged 15–19 and 20–24 years. Figure 5 Comparison of Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) self-harm incidence rates with Read code-identified CPRD self-harm incidence rates per 100 000 for 2007 in the HES-linked English practices in the CPRD.  , HES;  , CPRD England (HES-linked CPRD data) Approximately 68.4% of patients had a self-harm Read code in the CPRD within 6 months of a relevant HES self-harm ICD code, indicating that around one-third of hospital-admitted cases of self-harm are not recorded by their GP using these Read codes on the CPRD. Patients recorded on both HES and CPRD were of a similar age to those who did not have a CPRD Read code after hospital admission, although they were more likely to be female (62.2% female compared with 52.7% male). Free text searches Read code records failed to identify 1670 out of the 2260 ONS-confirmed suicides in 1998–2010. Free text searches of these records identified an additional 179 cases of suicides, amounting to 10.7% of the missed cases. There were 622 patients who were admitted to hospital with self-harm in 2010 who did not have a Read-coded CPRD record of self-harm within 6 months of hospital admission. One hundred and one (16.2%) of these patients would have been identified as cases of nonfatal self-harm from searching the free text records. Discussion Main findings We validated the reporting of suicide and self-harm based on Read code algorithms using various data sources. We found fewer suicides than expected using Read code algorithms for all UK CPRD practices. In the 50% of English practices linked to the ONS data, Read code algorithms had low sensitivity (26.1%; 95% CI: 24.3–28.0%) and PPV (55.5%; 95% CI: 52.5–58.5%) compared with the gold standard ONS data, and underestimated suicide rates in both sexes for all age groups. Sensitivity and PPV were lowest in those aged 75 years and over. This is likely to be a direct result of the methodology (i.e. suicide-related Read codes associated with death in a certain time period) used to identify suicide prior to the availability of linked ICD-coded mortality data, because older people are less likely to self-harm and more likely to die from other (nonsuicide) causes of death compared with other age groups. This reduces sensitivity (because fewer suicides are preceded by self-harm in the elderly) and increases the number of false-positive ‘suicides’ (reduces the PPV). The PPV for Read code-identified suicides was higher in males than females; this is most probably because the risk of suicide amongst those people who self-harm is considerable higher in males than females  30 . Sensitivity increased with increasing number of days from the clinical event date to the CPRD-derived death date; this may be related to the time required for the completion of coroners' inquests for suicides and hence delays in GPs being notified of patient deaths. Suicide rates in English ONS-linked practices were comparable to ONS rates for England for most years except 2010. This discrepancy in 2010 may be due to delays in receiving coroners' reports, because our CPRD data set was constructed in May 2011, and 2010 suicide rates were published by the ONS only in early 2012 ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/subnational-health4/suicides-in-the-united-kingdom/2010/stb-statistical-bulletin.html , accessed 7 February 2012). Approximately two-thirds of hospital admissions for self-harm had a self-harm Read code recorded within 6 months of their admission. Although self-harm rates based on Read codes followed a similar age and sex distribution to those recorded in hospital registries of patients presenting with self-harm, the Read code-defined events underestimated the rates in the majority of age groups when self-harm registry data were used for comparison. The CPRD self-harm rates were approximately twice the HES self-harm rates for men aged 15–19 and 20–24 years. This may be due to the better recording of self-harm in the CPRD for these age groups or because when they attend hospital for self-harm they are less likely to be admitted, because self-harm in these groups may be considered a weaker predictor of suicide risk. The risk of suicide increases with an individual's age at the time of self-harm  30 . Searches of free text records in the CPRD identified 10.7% of the suicides missed by Read code searches and 16.1% of the missed cases of nonfatal self-harm. Strengths and limitations This is the first study to validate self-harm recording in the entire CPRD and the largest and most comprehensive appraisal of suicide validation to date. Although suicide recording has been validated before in the Value Added Medical Products (VAMP) health resource, the precursor to the CPRD, it was based on a cohort of patients prescribed antidepressants and was done over 15 years ago  20 . Although best practice for identification of fatal outcomes in the CPRD involves the follow-up of all deaths (for example, the examination of free text records for all deaths as well as death certificate data for all deaths where cause of death was unknown), such an approach is extremely expensive. Therefore, we took a pragmatic approach and validated the methods that have been used in practice in recent research literature to identify suicides and self-harm outcomes in the CPRD  7 ,  31 ,  32 . We had no gold standard for ‘true’ cases of nonfatal self-harm, so we could not directly compare the self-harm rates based on the Read code algorithms with the HES data; the latter cover admitted patients who comprise only 50% of hospital-presenting cases of self-harm  28 . The similarities of the age and sex distributions of the CPRD-identified nonfatal self-harm cases to those seen in HES and the Multicentre Study of Self-Harm register data provide some reassurance that while CPRD under-records self-harm, there may not be any age or sex bias in the under-recording. Although data were available from hospital registries of patients presenting with self-harm in Oxford, Manchester and Derby, these cities may not be representative of the entire UK. Comparison with previous studies A variety of methods have been previously used to validate diagnoses within the CPRD  33 . These methods were either internal, e.g. using free text (where GPs record uncoded comments related to the consultation) or sensitivity analyses using different diagnostic algorithms, or external, such as GP questionnaires, provision of copies of anonymized clinical paper records and comparison of incidence rates. However, most validations are compromised by the low practice participation rates, which limit the generalizability of the findings. The quality of reporting of the validations also differed among studies, and many papers did not provide lists of the Read code algorithms that were used. We were surprised by the extent of under-reporting for suicide and self-harm in the CPRD, which was in contrast to the almost 100% accuracy reported in the VAMP database  20 , but more in keeping with recent estimates described by Hall [17], where only one case out of seven confirmed suicides was recorded as such in THIN. Another validation of suicide recording in THIN in a cohort of patients with epilepsy found more promising results, with a high PPV of 88%  18 ; however, the authors compared Read codes with GP questionnaires; findings were not reported for comparisons with death certificates, which had also been requested. Also, many intentional self-harm Read codes were omitted from their algorithms; no clear rationale was provided for their omission. Conclusions We found that the use of conventional Read code algorithms in the CPRD to detect cases of suicide misses approximately three-quarters of suicides and generates a high number of false positives (PPV 55.5%). Free text searching detects only around 10% of missed cases. Whilst linked data are available for only around half of all CPRD practices, more suicides are detected in this subset of CPRD, because the sensitivity is 100% instead of the 26.1% obtained when Read codes are used to identify cases. This more than compensates for the reduction in the total patient population available from the limited number of practices that consented to linkage. Therefore, future studies of suicide in the CPRD should use linked ONS mortality data. The under-reporting of self-harm in the CPRD appears to be less marked than that of suicide (about 50% when compared with hospital registry data of hospital attendances for self-harm and 32% for hospital-admitted cases; see Table  2 ); however, our assessment of self-harm was less comprehensive, because there was no appropriate gold standard with a record of all incident episodes of self-harm. Free text searching detected only 16% of the missed cases. It may be useful to study HES self-harm outcomes as well as Read code algorithm-identified self-harm. Advantages of using HES self-harm data include greater accuracy and the fact that hospital admissions are likely to be more severe cases of self-harm. The HES self-harm may therefore be a more relevant outcome for researchers who are interested in studying nonfatal self-harm with high suicidal intent, because such cases may be more likely to require hospital admission. However, only 50% of English CPRD practices have consented to linkage, so studies which use HES self-harm as their primary outcome may have reduced power compared with those based on Read code-identified cases. Furthermore, hospital-admitted cases of self-harm may be different in relation to methods used, degree of suicidal intent and subsequent management. The creation of the CPRD from the GPRD in March 2012 will be hugely beneficial to pharmacoepidemiological research, because there will be greater coverage of the UK population and an excellent opportunity for increasing linkage to other databases, thus improving the accuracy of determining certain clinical outcomes. This study highlights the potential benefits of further data linkage. Persuading more practices to consent to linkage may provide considerable rewards, although these data will also require validation. </Body>

    <Body>What is already known about this subject 
 Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive pulmonary vasculopathy that can lead to right ventricle failure and death. Several therapeutic options exist worldwide for the treatment of PAH in adults Approved therapies for PAH in children are lacking, and therefore approved therapies for PAH in adults are often used off label in children 
 What this study adds 
 Based on tadalafil exposure in paediatric patients with PAH, doses suitable for further clinical research are 40 mg daily for paediatric patients ≥40 kg and 20 mg daily for patients &lt;40 kg body weight and aged ≥2 years. The safety profile of tadalafil in the study population is consistent with that in the adult population 
 1 INTRODUCTION Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive pulmonary vasculopathy that can lead to right ventricle failure and death. 1  PAH is associated with reduced levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), caused by impaired release of nitric oxide due to little or no expression of nitric oxide synthase in the vascular endothelium of pulmonary arteries. 2  The effects of cGMP are mediated in part by phosphodiesterases. 3 ,  4  Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) is the predominant phosphodiesterase isoenzyme in the pulmonary vasculature; it normally degrades cGMP, and therefore inhibiting PDE5 increases endogenous cGMP, which relaxes pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells and dilates the pulmonary vascular bed. Several therapeutic options exist worldwide for the treatment of PAH in adults. Tadalafil 40 mg once daily (QD), a potent and selective PDE5 inhibitor administered orally, was approved for the treatment of PAH in adults. Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Response to Tadalafil (PHIRST) was a global Phase 3 study that evaluated tadalafil for 16 weeks in adult PAH patients. Tadalafil 40 mg QD was well tolerated and associated with improved exercise capability, 5 ,  6  and, based on this study, tadalafil was approved for use in adults to treat PAH in adults. Despite the progress of treatment in adults, approved therapies for PAH in children are lacking. Currently, the therapies approved in adults are often used off‐label in children 7  and, therefore, there is a need to evaluate the safety and efficacy of such treatments in paediatric patients with PAH for clinicians to take an informed decision about this treatment option. Weight‐adjusted tadalafil doses of 1.0 ± 0.4 mg/kg/day 8  and 0.991 ± 0.540 mg/kg/day 9  have had favourable safety profiles in paediatric patients with PAH. 8 ,  9  Here, we report the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of QD tadalafil treatment in paediatric patients with PAH to establish an appropriate dose range for further clinical research. 2 METHODS Study LVIG ( ClinicalTrials.gov  identifier: NCT01484431, phase 1b/2a) was an open‐label, multicentre, international, multiple‐ascending‐dose study to evaluate the PK and safety and to establish an appropriate dose for further clinical research of tadalafil administered orally as a tablet or suspension to children with PAH, either idiopathic (including hereditary) or associated with collagen vascular disease or congenital heart defects after surgical repair. Eligible patients were aged 6 months to &lt;18 years, with PAH established by resting mean pulmonary artery pressure ≥25 mmHg, pulmonary artery wedge pressure ≤15 mmHg, and a pulmonary vascular resistance ≥3 Wood units via right heart catheterisation, and had World Health Organization functional class value of I, II or III. Patients were either not on PAH‐specific therapy or were receiving endothelin receptor antagonists (ERA), specifically bosentan or ambrisentan for ≥12 weeks prior to screening. The study was conducted in 2 parts. In Period 1, patients were evaluated for PK and safety/tolerability of tadalafil during the first 10 weeks of treatment. Patients continued into Period 2 for at least 2 years for safety evaluation; Period 2 is ongoing and beyond the scope of this manuscript. All patients were divided into 3 cohorts based on body weight: heavy weight (HW; ≥40 kg), middle weight (MW; 25 to &lt;40 kg), and light weight (LW; &lt;25 kg). Each patient received tadalafil QD for 10 weeks: 5 weeks at a low dose and then 5 weeks at a high dose (Table  1 ). This study was conducted in accordance with consensus ethics principles derived from international ethics guidelines, including the Declaration of Helsinki and Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) International Ethical Guidelines; the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) GCP Guideline [E6]; and applicable local laws and regulations. The local ethics review committees approved the protocol, and written informed consent was obtained from legal guardians prior to a patient's participation.

The goal of the study was to determine and test doses that would produce comparable adult exposure in paediatric patients with the theory that achieving this goal would produce similar therapeutic results. Doses selected for each cohort were intended to produce plasma tadalafil concentrations within the range of those produced by 5–10 mg (for the low dose) or 20–40 mg (for the high dose) of tadalafil in adults with PAH. The tadalafil doses predicted to produce target exposures in paediatric patients were determined by simulations based on allometric principles 10 ,  11  using a population PK model developed from the dose–response study in adult patients with PAH (PHIRST study, data on file). Apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (V/F) in adults were used to predict paediatric CL/F and V/F by calculating a body/weight ratio and then applying allometric exponents (0.75 and 1, respectively) including parameter values both with and without bosentan for a variety of paediatric weights. These results were then used to conduct dose–exposure simulations in S‐PLUS (TIBCO Spotfire S+) using a 1‐compartment oral absorption population PK model assuming the same interpatient variability obtained from the adult model overlaid with simulations of adult exposure. In the PHIRST study, the adult patients who benefited most from tadalafil treatment received ≥20 mg tadalafil once daily regardless of the PK influence of bosentan and other disease‐ or patient‐specific factors. Therefore, the simulations were used to predict the tadalafil dose, which would yield exposures in paediatrics at the high dose similar to those in adults receiving tadalafil 20 or 40 mg QD, but not exceeding the 40‐mg QD maximum dose (with bosentan: median AUC = 9600 ng*h/mL, range = 5906–17 306 ng*h/mL; without bosentan: median AUC = 14 825 ng*h/mL, range = 10 017–26 792 ng*h/mL). Doses expected to achieve the plasma tadalafil concentrations per the objective of the study were specified in the protocol, but as permitted by the protocol, the planned low and/or high dose(s) could be revised for patients based on emerging data during the study. Even though the population PK analysis of the adult study PHIRST did not find weight to be a significant covariate in patients ≥40 kg, based on discussions with regulatory authorities, all patients were stratified into 3 body‐weight cohorts. Stratification by body weight would ensure a more appropriate distribution of body size while maintaining a broad association with age. Likewise, due to disease pathophysiology and disease conditions, this population may not follow normal male and female paediatric growth charts, thus, weight stratification could account for the potential modest divergence in body weight and age pattern due to underlying disease or across geographies. Typically, in the current study, HW patients were aged &gt;12 years, MW patients were aged between 6 and 12 years, and LW patients were aged &lt;6 years. The 25‐kg threshold for the lightest weight‐group was also considered as a respective age below which most children would be unable to swallow tadalafil tablets and instead were administered an oral 2‐mg/mL tadalafil suspension, whereas HW and MW patients were treated with commercially available tadalafil tablets. Once the paediatric weight ranges were identified, fixed low or high tadalafil doses based upon PK simulation were selected for each weight cohort for the protocol. Serial blood samples were collected for evaluation of tadalafil PK in plasma on Day 1 after the first low dose, on Day 14 at steady state after the 14th low dose, and on Day 49 at steady state after the 14th high dose. Sampling times were predose and 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours postdose. In each patient, the high dose was selected to produce tadalafil concentrations within the range of those produced by 20–40 mg of tadalafil in adults with PAH. The escalation from low dose to high dose was selected in each individual patient from the tadalafil concentration data on Day 1 and Day 14 and on the safety data and any clinically significant physical signs or safety laboratory results through about 4 weeks after the start of low‐dose treatment. In most cases, the high dose was chosen from the PK/safety results of the low dose, which included the steady‐state AUC it produced, the target AUC at the high dose, and knowledge of tadalafil's dose proportionality. For the first patients in the MW and LW cohort, a more conservative high dose was chosen for safety considerations (these were Patients 1 and 10 in Table  1 ). Tadalafil concentrations were measured at Q 2  Solutions (Ithaca, NY, USA) using a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method with lower and upper quantification limits of 0.5 and 500 ng/mL, respectively. The interassay accuracy (relative error) during validation ranged from −2.98% to 0.63%; the interassay precision (relative standard deviation) during validation ranged from 1.49% to 4.97% (data on file). 2.1 Analyses Evaluation of individual profiles during the study was based on PK parameter estimates calculated using standard noncompartmental methods of analysis (Phoenix WinNonlin Professional Network Edition, Version 6.3.0.395). Individual profiles were analysed during the study to evaluate dose escalations in individual patients and to evaluate (as data became available) the appropriateness of the starting doses for subsequent patients. Final noncompartmental analyses included all data from all enrolled patients who received at least 1 dose of tadalafil and had an evaluable PK profile. Interim analyses conducted during the trial for dose escalations used nominal sampling times; the final analysis used actual sampling times. The tadalafil PK data in the paediatric study population were compared with the historical PK data in adults with PAH. 5 
 2.2 Study assessments The primary parameters for noncompartmental PK analyses were area under the plasma concentration–time curve during 1 dosing interval (AUC τ ), maximum plasma concentration (C max ), and apparent plasma clearance of drug after extravascular administration at steady state (CL ss /F). Safety and tolerability were evaluated in all patients who received at least 1 dose of tadalafil and were reported as treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAEs) by monitoring vital signs, physical examination, laboratory tests, adverse events and 12‐lead electrocardiogram. 3 RESULTS Nineteen patients (6 HW, 7 MW and 6 LW) aged 2–17 years with PAH were enrolled. Eighteen patients completed the 10‐week PK/safety period in accordance with the protocol. One patient in the MW group discontinued prematurely due to physician decision; the data from this patient were included in the PK and safety analyses. The demographics and baseline characteristics are shown in Table  2 . The mean age was 10 years; 65% were female and 74% were Caucasian. Twelve patients (67%) had idiopathic PAH and 5 patients (28%) had persistent PAH after surgical repair of congenital heart disease. Prior to and during the PK/safety study period, no changes were made to pre‐existing ERA treatment.

The AUC estimates in individual patients receiving low‐dose tadalafil are shown in Figure  1 . The average accumulation ratio from single dose to steady state was 1.3 across all 19 patients whose AUC was calculated on both Day 1 and Day 14. Tadalafil concentrations in the no bosentan‐treated patients were generally higher than those in the bosentan‐treated patients (Figure  1 ).

Open symbols represent subjects taking concomitant bosentan. Solid symbols represent subjects taking ambrisentan or no endothelin receptor antagonist The individual plasma tadalafil concentration–time profiles by weight cohort receiving low dose on Day 14 and high dose Day 49 are shown in Figure  2 . In all weight cohorts, tadalafil concentrations in the no bosentan‐treated patients were generally higher than those in the bosentan‐treated patients (Figure  2 ). A similar effect of bosentan on tadalafil concentrations was found in adult patients with PAH. 12

Note: Where profiles appear increasing at 24 hours, the patient had taken the next dose prior to the 24‐hour sample The AUC in HW patients taking tadalafil 40 mg QD was within the range of AUC in adult patients treated with tadalafil 20–40 mg (Figure  3 ). Most AUCs of patients in the MW group taking 10–20 mg QD and in the LW group taking 8–20 mg QD were also within the range of AUC in adult patients treated with tadalafil 20 mg to 40 mg, although a few fell below this range (Figure  3 ). The AUC at steady state at Day 49 for all patients from LVIG were compared with those in adult patients with PAH from the PHIRST study. Tadalafil exposures in the study population were within the range of exposures in adult patients taking 20–40 mg QD (Figure  3 ), but a given dose tended to produce lower exposure in children than in adults.

The most frequently reported TEAEs were pyrexia ( n  = 3), abdominal pain ( n  = 2), headache ( n =  2), nausea ( n =  2), pain in extremity ( n =  2), rash ( n =  2), and viral infection ( n =  2; Table  4 ). Most TEAEs reported were mild (63% [ n  = 12]) or moderate (21% [ n  = 4]) in severity; no adverse event led to a study discontinuation. Two patients (11%; 1 each in MW and HW cohorts) were hospitalised (serious adverse events) with viral infection; neither event was considered to be study drug‐related on evaluation by investigators. There were no deaths and no clinically relevant changes from baseline in laboratory parameters, vital signs or electrocardiograms.

Only the 40‐mg dose reached statistical significance in the adult Phase 3 trial; however, the data showed only a small difference in the model‐predicted 6‐minute walk response between patients taking 20‐mg tadalafil and those taking 40‐mg tadalafil. Evaluation of the PK results in this study was challenging because the study population size was small ( n  = 19) and was divided into smaller groups according to weight cohort, dose and bosentan status. The patients in the HW cohort received 10 mg for the first 5 weeks and were dose‐escalated to 20 or 40 mg for the second 5 weeks. The AUCs calculated during the high‐dose treatment were generally within the range of AUCs reported in adult patients taking 20–40 mg of tadalafil. As paediatric patients in the HW cohort demonstrated PK similar to that in adults in the Phase 3 study, the 40‐mg dose of tadalafil (the approved dose for adult patients with PAH) could be recommended for HW paediatric patients in future studies. As the current trial progressed, additional challenges were faced during dose escalation, whereby tadalafil exposures in the paediatric patients were generally lower than those predicted before the trial. The modelling and simulations that predicted the low and high doses in each weight cohort incorporated allometric scaling based on adult data, but assumed a typical weight effect as body size decreased into the range of younger paediatric patients. These simulations had predicted substantial reductions in doses as weight decreased from the HW to the MW and LW cohorts. Following completion of the MW cohort, the simulations based upon adults were updated to incorporate the HW and MW PK data and the low dose for the LW cohort was redefined to a higher than planned dose. However, upon completing the trial, the current study data suggest that there is not an allometric relationship between weight and tadalafil exposure for paediatric patients (aged 2–17). Starting with the reasonable assumption of allometric principles influenced the low doses and the direction of the MW and LW dose escalations. Patients in the MW cohort received 5 mg during the first 5 weeks and then were dose‐escalated to 10 or 20 mg for the subsequent 5‐week period. The individual AUCs in the MW cohort during the high‐dose treatment were generally within the range of AUCs reported in adult patients receiving 20–40 mg of tadalafil in the adult Phase 3 trial. However, the 20‐mg dose was the highest dose tested in this cohort and was the highest dose for which safety data are available, and therefore 20 mg is the highest dose that can currently be recommended for MW paediatric patients in future studies. Patients in the LW cohort received 2 or 4 mg during the first 5 weeks and the dose was escalated to 8–20 mg for the second 5‐week period. The individual AUCs in this cohort during the high‐dose treatment were also generally within the range of AUCs reported in adult patients receiving 20–40 mg of tadalafil in the adult Phase 3 trial. However, the 20‐mg dose was the highest dose tested in this cohort and was the highest dose for which safety data were available, and therefore 20 mg is also the highest dose that can be recommended for LW paediatric patients (aged ≥2 years) in the paediatric Phase 3 studies. The current analysis suggests, that based on the conservative approach taken to target the median adult AUC during dose escalation, the paediatric doses chosen for further research are appropriate but produce AUCs in the median‐to‐lower part of the adult 20–40 mg/day AUC range. We believe that being in this part of the range will not affect efficacy in paediatric patients because the increase in 6‐minute walk distance in adults is very similar between the 20 and 40‐mg/day doses, although only the 40‐mg dose was significant at  P  &lt; .01 (for 20 mg,  P  = .028). 5 
 This study does not specify dosing for patients aged &lt;2 years because no patient &lt;2 years was enrolled and therefore no PK data are available for that age range. Moreover, the major elimination pathway for tadalafil is metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4, which is lowest at birth and then increases. 13 ,  14  It is possible that tadalafil is also metabolised by CYP3A7, which typically has similar substrate specificity as CYP3A4, although affinities can differ. 15 ,  16  The activity of CYP3A7 is highest at birth and then diminishes until age about 2 years, at which point its activity is very low. 14  Given the different directional changes in the activities of these enzymes from birth, and the potentially different affinities of the enzymes for tadalafil, the data from this study cannot be simply extrapolated to ages younger than those assessed in the study. To predict exposure in patients younger than 2 years would be likely to require physiologically based PK modelling that could account for these differences in enzyme activities. Tadalafil had an acceptable safety profile in the study population and was generally consistent with the known safety profile of tadalafil in the adult population, including the events associated with the underlying disease state. There were no trends in the incidence of AE during the low‐ or high‐dose portions of Period 1. Tadalafil was well tolerated and no patient from any weight cohort was discontinued due to AEs. 5 CONCLUSION Tadalafil was well tolerated and the overall safety profile from this study was consistent with the known safety profile of tadalafil. Given the overall considerations of tadalafil dose and the current study results, tadalafil exposure in paediatric patients with PAH who take 40 mg QD and weigh ≥40 kg, or who take 20 mg QD and weigh &lt;40 kg and are aged ≥2 years are within the range of AUC in adult patients treated with 20–40 mg QD. These doses are suitable for further clinical research. COMPETING INTERESTS D.S. is a retired employee of Eli Lilly and Company and owns Lilly stock.

    <Body>What is Already Known about this Subject 
 Some thalassaemia patients may develop renal impairment. Patients with renal impairment may require dose adjustments of some medications, due to increased drug concentrations caused by a reduction in clearance. It is important to know if the dosage of deferiprone needs to be adjusted in thalassemia patients with renal impairment. 
 What this Study Adds 
 When the maximum dosage of deferiprone was administered to subjects with no, mild, moderate or severe renal impairment, there were no significant group differences in systemic exposure. No safety concerns were noted in any of the groups. Adjustment of the deferiprone dosage regimen in patients with renal impairment appears unnecessary. 
 Introduction Deferiprone (DFP; trade name Ferriprox™; chemical name 3‐hydroxy‐1,2‐dimethylpyridin‐4‐one) is an orally active bidentate iron chelator that preferentially binds trivalent iron cations (Fe 3+ ) in a 3 : 1 (deferiprone : iron) complex. It is currently approved for the treatment of patients with transfusional iron overload due to thalassemia syndromes. Chronic blood transfusion therapy reduces disease‐related morbidity and mortality in these patients, but introduces a progressive iron overload that damages the heart, liver and endocrine organs in particular  1 ,  2 . Therapy with DFP has been shown to result in reduction in iron burden in regularly transfused iron‐overloaded patients  3 , as well as reduction of iron‐induced cardiac disease and prolongation of survival  4 . Over the last decade, there has been an increased level of attention directed towards renal disease in patients with thalassemia. Case reports and natural history studies have revealed varying degrees of both tubular and glomerular dysfunction, which tends to increase with age and the presence of co‐morbidities. Proteinuria is common. Some patients with thalassaemia develop renal tubular dysfunction that is related to the disease itself (including chronic hypoxia from anaemia), the effects of iron overload and the effects of chelator therapy, while other patients have an increased creatinine clearance, leading to hyperfiltration  5 ,  6 ,  7 ,  8 . In light of the growing recognition of renal disease in thalassaemia, it is important to understand the impact of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of iron chelators. In patients with kidney disease, administration of the usual doses of many drugs often leads to inappropriate responses and a higher incidence of adverse reactions  9 ,  10 . The most obvious explanation for these effects is increased drug concentrations due to a reduction in drug clearance, particularly because of a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR)  11 . This is of particular relevance to elderly patients where GFR is reduced  12 . However, several mechanisms other than GFR might also contribute, including changes in renal transporters  13 , down‐regulation of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes  14 ,  15 , possible suppression of phase II metabolic enzymes  16  and abnormal plasma protein binding  17 , which could alter drug disposition, leading to altered drug concentration–time profiles. Techniques for determining the appropriate drug dosage in patients with renal impairment have been well worked out  9 ,  10 ,  18 ,  19 , but generally require a good understanding of the fraction of drug excreted unchanged, the fraction bound to plasma proteins and whether or not active transport is a prominent contributor to renal elimination. DFP glucuronidation seems to depend almost totally on UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 A6 (UGT1A6), especially in the liver, with the predominant metabolite being an inactive 3‐ O‐ glucuronide conjugate (DFP‐G)  20 ,  21 . Glucuronidation of deferiprone results in loss of the iron‐binding capacity due to the inactivation of the 3‐hydroxy functional group  22 . Both the metabolite and the DFP‐iron complex are excreted primarily by the kidneys, and approximately 80% of the dose is recovered from the urine in the form of drug, metabolite and drug bound to iron  2 . Less than 20% is bound to serum proteins (unpublished data). To our knowledge, the current study is the first systematic investigation of the pharmacokinetics and safety of DFP in subjects with impaired renal function, and provides guidance on whether dose adjustment is required in this population. Methods Study design and study subjects This non‐randomized, open label, single dose, parallel group study was conducted to compare the safety and pharmacokinetics of DFP in subjects with and without renal impairment. A total of 32 participants aged 31 to 75 years were enrolled, comprising 24 patients with different stages of renal impairment and eight healthy volunteers (HVs). The degree of impairment was determined using the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) according to the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study  23 , which is the equation recommended by the FDA Guidance for Industry for the estimation of creatinine clearance  24 . (Arguably, estimation of GFR based on cystatin C might have provided more accurate results. However, any difference would not have changed the interpretation of the pharmacokinetic analyses.) Subjects were categorized into four groups, eight per group: no renal impairment (eGFR ≥90 ml min −1  1.73 m – 
 2 ), mild impairment (eGFR 60–89 ml min −1  1.73 m – 
 2 ), moderate impairment (eGFR 30–59 ml min −1  1.73 m – 
 2 ) and severe impairment (eGFR 15–29 ml min −1  1.73 m – 
 2 ). All renally impaired subjects, including those categorized as severe, had to be clinically stable in the opinion of the investigator. Exclusion criteria included history of renal transplant, current dialysis, a clinically significant medical condition other than renal impairment (history or presence, in the investigator's opinion, of clinically significant unstable respiratory, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, haematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, neurologic or psychiatric disease) and presence of a gastrointestinal disorder that might have interfered with drug absorption or otherwise affected PK parameters. The renally impaired subjects and the HVs were matched as far as reasonably possible for age, weight and tobacco use, and an attempt was made to have a similar number of males and females within each group. Prior to enrolment of the first subject, the study was approved by the ethics committee IRB Services, and was posted on  ClinicalTrials.gov  (trial registration number NCT01770652). Written informed consent was obtained from each participant prior to enrolment in the study. Following an overnight fast of at least 10 h, all subjects received a single oral dose of 33 mg kg −1  of DFP, provided as 500 mg Ferriprox tablets rounded to the nearest half‐tablet (250 mg). Sample collection and analysis Blood samples (5 ml) were collected in Vacutainer tubes without anticoagulant or separating gel at the following time points: prior to dosing and at 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.0, 1.33, 1.66, 2.0, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16 and 24 h post‐dose. Samples were centrifuged and the serum was divided into two aliquots and stored at −20°C until shipped for analysis. Urine samples to determine the urinary excretion of DFP were collected at the following intervals: –2 to 0 h prior to dosing and at 0–2, 2–4, 4–8, 8–12 and 12–24 h post‐dose. All urine collected during an interval was pooled and two 10 ml aliquots from each sampling interval were stored at −80°C until shipped for analysis. Both serum and urine samples were analyzed for concentrations of DFP and its metabolite DFP‐G, using validated high‐performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection method (HPLC‐MS/MS). (The method was developed and validated by Celerion, 624 Peach Street, Lincoln, Nebraska, 68 502, USA.) Quality control (QC) samples were used to demonstrate adequate precision and accuracy of the assay. Acceptable sample stability and sensitivity were also demonstrated. For the quantification of DFP and DFP‐G in serum, the limit of quantitation (LOQ) was 0.1 μg ml −1 . Concentrations were determined using a weighted linear regression analysis of peak area ratios of the analyte and internal standard (over a concentration range from 0.1 to 20 μg ml −1  for both analytes). Dilution integrity, up to 100 μg ml −1  (diluted 10‐fold), was also demonstrated for both analytes. Precision and accuracy for both intra‐ and inter‐day variability ranged from 1.9% to 5.1% and from −3.0 to 2.0%, respectively. For the quantification of DFP and DFP‐G in urine, the LOQs were 0.5 μg ml −1  and 50.0 μg ml −1 , respectively. Quantitation was determined using a weighted linear regression analysis of peak area ratios of the analyte and internal standard (over a concentration range from 0.5 to 100 μg ml −1  for DFP and 50.0 to 10 000 μg ml −1  for DFP‐G). Dilution integrity up to 500 μg ml −1  and 20 000 μg ml −1  (diluted 10‐fold) has also been demonstrated for DFP and DFP‐G, respectively. Precision and accuracy for both intra‐ and inter‐day variability ranged from 1.1% to 9.4% and from −10.6 to 8.0%, respectively. Pharmacokinetic analyses The following pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for DFP:  C 
 max  (maximum measured serum concentration),  t 
 max  (time to maximum serum concentration), AUC(0, t ) (area under the concentration–time curve to the last measureable concentration), AUC(0,∞) (area under the concentration–time curve to infinity),  t 
 ½  (terminal elimination half‐life), CL/ F  (total body clearance, corrected for bioavailability), CL r  (renal clearance),  V 
 d / F  (apparent volume of distribution, corrected for bioavailability), Ae(0,24 h) (amount excreted in urine from time zero to 24 h), and Fe(0,24 h) (fraction of dose excreted unchanged in urine from time zero to 24 h). For DFP‐G, the pharmacokinetic parameters of  C 
 max ,  t 
 max , AUC(0, t ), AUC(0,∞),  t 
 ½ , CL r , Ae(0,24 h) and Fe(0,24 h) were determined. Pharmacokinetic and statistical analyses were performed using validated software (Phoenix ®  WinNonlin ®  version 6.3 and SAS ®  version 9.2, respectively). The pharmacokinetic parameters of DFP and its metabolite were derived from individual serum concentration– and urinary excretion–time profiles, and were summarized using descriptive statistics. A regression analysis in which the estimated renal function was treated as the predictor variable was used to evaluate the relationship between renal function and the estimated pharmacokinetic parameters of DFP and DFP‐G. The eGFR and creatinine clearance were used as the estimate of renal function in separate analyses. As the correlation (slope of trend ≠ 0) between a PK parameter and the renal function was found to be significant ( P  &lt; 0.05), an analysis of variance ( anova ) was performed to assess the differences in the PK parameter among the control group and the three groups of subjects with impaired renal function, and the 90% confidence interval of the difference was calculated for each pairwise comparison. The Tukey–Kramer method was used for multiplicity adjustment. For AUC(0, t ), AUC(0,∞) and  C 
 max , the log‐transformed data were used in the regression analysis and the  anova . Safety assessment Safety was assessed throughout the study by collecting information on the following: adverse events (AEs), use of concomitant medications, vital signs, coagulation times, physical examination, standard 12‐lead electrocardiogram, haematology, biochemistry and urinalysis. The data for continuous variables were summarized using descriptive statistics and the data for discrete variables were tabulated with frequency tables. Results Study subjects Subject ages ranged from 31 to 75 years, with an overall mean of 59 (± 11) years. The group means ranged from 56 (± 9) years for HVs to 64 (± 5) years for subjects with mild impairment. While males outnumbered females overall, 19 (59.4%) to 13 (40.6%), all groups included subjects of both genders, with the male : female ratio ranging from 3 : 5 in the HV group to 6 : 2 in the severe impairment group. The severe renal impairment group included two Black subjects. All other subjects were White. Mean weight was similar across groups, ranging from 69.3 kg to 74.6 kg, as was BMI, ranging from 24.4 to 27.3 kg m –2 . The majority of participants had never smoked or had quit, with just four reporting current smoking. Mean eGFR (ml min −1  1.73m – 
 2 ) was 99.8 (± 9.5) in the HV group, 75.4 (± 9.3) in the mild group, 45.9 (± 9.1) in the moderate group and 22.5 (± 3.0) in the severe group. All 32 subjects received the assigned dose of study drug and provided serum and urine samples over 24 h post‐dose for the assessment of serum pharmacokinetics and renal clearance of DFP and its glucuronide metabolite. All subjects were included in the safety analysis, but a total of five were excluded from the PK assessments of serum DFP and/or DFP‐G: two subjects (one with moderate impairment, one with severe impairment) from the analysis of serum DFP data, one (moderate impairment) from the analysis of serum DFP‐G data and two (both with severe impairment) from the analysis of both analytes. The reasons for the exclusions were consecutive missing concentration values adjacent to the observed DFP  t 
 max  for analytical reasons (haemolysis), several missing samples around the expected  t 
 max  for clinical reasons (difficulty in blood collection) and a concern over a subject taking a prohibited concomitant medication (furosemide). Accordingly, the population for the analysis of serum DFP data contained 28 subjects (i.e. four excluded) and that for the analysis of DFP‐G data contained 29 subjects (i.e. three excluded). The subject who was excluded from the serum analyses due to the use of furosemide was also excluded from the analysis for both urine DFP data and urine DFP‐G data. Thus, the population for the analyses of urine data contained 31 subjects. Other than in the cases of consecutive missing concentrations, the decision to exclude a subject was always made prior to conducting the bioanalysis. Pharmacokinetics Deferiprone In all four groups, DFP was detected in serum within 15 min of its administration. Serum concentrations reached a mean maximum value within 0.5 to 1 h and then declined rapidly, with a mean  t 
 1/2  that ranged from 1.7 to 2.2 h across groups. Importantly, while renal impairment, as expected, had an impact on renal clearance of DFP, with DFP renal clearance declining as the level of impairment increased, it had no impact on total body clearance. The regression analysis indicated no significant differences in  C 
 max , AUC(0, t ), AUC(0,∞), CL/ F  and  V 
 d / F  between subjects with renal impairment and HVs (see Figure  1  and Table  1 ). A significant trend for  t 
 max ,  t 
 1/2 , and CL r  was observed in the regression analysis using eGFR as the predictor variable. However, when creatinine clearance was used as the predictor variable, only CL r  exhibited a significant trend, with the value decreasing as the severity of renal impairment increased. Pairwise comparisons of group data from the  anova  revealed significant differences for the following: normal  vs . moderate, normal  vs . severe, mild  vs . moderate and mild  vs . severe. No significant differences between groups were observed for  t 
 max  and  t 
 1/2 .

The fraction of DFP excreted in urine relative to the dose administered, as determined by Fe(0,24 h), ranged from 1.0% to 3.5%, which is consistent with biotransformation to DFP‐G being the primary determinant of drug clearance. A significant trend ( P  &lt; 0.0003) of decreasing Fe(0,24 h) with increasing renal impairment was observed.

 1/2  of 2.1 to 3.4 h in all groups. A significant trend was observed for all parameters in relation to eGFR or creatinine clearance. As the severity of renal impairment increased, the values of  C 
 max , AUC(0, t ), AUC(0,∞),  t 
 max  and  t 
 1/2  increased and that of CL r  decreased (see Figure  3  and Table  3 ). The rate of decrease in CL r  was greater in subjects with more severe renal impairment. This resulted in a greater rate of increase in  C 
 max , AUC(0, t ) and AUC(0,∞) in subjects with moderate or severe renal impairment than in subjects with mild renal impairment or HVs. This is supported by the metabolite : parent drug ratio of AUC(0,∞), after accounting for their difference in molecular weight, which clearly showed that exposure to DFP‐G relative to that of DFP increased disproportionately as the severity of renal impairment increased. For AUC(0, t ) and AUC(0,∞), significant differences were observed for all pairwise comparisons, and for  C 
 max , significant differences were observed for all but moderate  vs.  severe.

Metabolite : parent ratio after molar conversion, calculated as (AUC(0,∞) DFP‐G/MWm)/(AUC(0,∞) DFP/MWp). MWp is the molecular weight of DFP (139.17 g mol −1 ) and MWm is the molecular weight of DFP‐G (315.28 g mol −1 ). In contrast to the low fraction of DFP excreted in urine, mean urinary excretion of DFP‐G ranged from 73.2% to 92.1%. As with DFP, a significant trend was observed, with the values of Fe(0,24 h) decreasing as the severity of renal impairment increased. The only group difference that reached significance was between the mild and moderate groups. Regardless of the level of renal impairment, the majority of the dose of DFP was excreted as DFP‐G. Overall, between 75% and 95% of the dose was retrieved in urine, either as DFP or DFP‐G. The mean Fe(0,24 h) values for DFP‐G are shown in Table  3 , and the cumulative mean Fe(0,24 h) values are shown in Figure  4 . Figure 4 Fraction of deferiprone‐3‐ O ‐glucuronide excreted in the urine over time, after a single oral dose of 33 mg kg −1  deferiprone.   normal,   mild impairment,   moderate impairment,   severe impairment Safety results The dose of DFP was well tolerated by all subjects. There were no serious AEs, no AEs rated as severe, no withdrawals from the study for safety reasons and no clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory tests, vital signs, ECG parameters or physical examination findings either within 24 h of deferiprone administration or at the follow‐up 24 to 72 h after discharge. Overall, nine subjects reported a total of 16 AEs, with the majority of AEs occurring in HVs and in subjects with mild renal impairment: seven events in two HVs, seven events in five subjects with mild renal impairment, and one event in one subject each in the groups with moderate and severe renal impairment. The most commonly reported AEs were somnolence and headache, which were experienced by four subjects each. Somnolence was reported by one subject in the HV group and by three in the mild renal impairment group and headache was reported by one subject in each of the four groups. All eight of these events were considered related to study product. All AEs in the study were of mild intensity except for one occurrence of moderate headache in a HV. The AEs were resolved prior to discharge, and only one required treatment (the use of ibuprofen to relieve a headache in a subject in the severe impairment group). Discussion The first clinical use of DFP was published in 1987  25 ,  26 . Early on, it was recognized that almost all of a given dose of DFP could be recovered in the urine as the parent compound, its glucuronide metabolite and the DFP‐iron complex  27 . This information has led to an assumption that dose adjustment is necessary in renal impairment to minimize risks emanating from an anticipated elevated concentration of DFP in such patients  28 . However, there has never been a study that compared the disposition of DFP in subjects with renal impairment and in healthy volunteers. The current investigation studied the impact of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of DFP by comparing the disposition of DFP and its principal metabolite, DFP‐G, in HVs with that in subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment. Safety parameters were also monitored in all groups. Subjects with renal impairment had serum concentrations of DFP that were similar to those of HVs. While renal clearance of DFP decreased more than three‐fold as renal function declined from no impairment to severe impairment, there was no significant change in total body clearance. This can be explained by the fact that renal clearance (CL r  = 1.0 l h −1 ) constituted only 3% of total body clearance (CL/ F  = 33.4 l h −1 ) in subjects with normal renal function, as reflected by Fe(0,24 h) &lt; 3.5% in this study and also reported in a previous study  21 . The majority of a dose of DFP is metabolized and excreted as DFP‐G in the urine. As a result, no significant impact on DFP systemic exposure occurred, and the  C 
 max  and AUC of DFP were not significantly different among subjects with renal impairment and those with normal renal function. This lack of difference in systemic exposure is contrasted with that seen with the 3‐ O ‐glucuronide metabolite. As this metabolite is extensively eliminated by excretion in the urine (Fe(0,24 h) = 86%), the significant reduction in its urinary excretion resulted in higher  C 
 max , AUC(0, t ) and AUC(0,∞) and longer  t 
 max  and  t 
 1/2  in the renally impaired groups compared with the healthy volunteers. While DFP‐G exhibited some plasma accumulation in renal impairment, it is less than what might be anticipated, as there is no biotransformation pathway to offset the reduction in renal excretion, as is the case for DFP. While the study did not measure faecal excretion, it is suspected that increased biliary excretion of DFP‐G will have compensated for the decline in renal excretion in those with impaired renal function, limiting the level of accumulation. Since the terminal half‐life of the DFP‐G increased to only about 3 h in patients with severe renal impairment, little accumulation, beyond that observed in the single dose study, would be anticipated upon chronic dosing in patients with impaired renal function. Previous studies in which DFP was administered to iron‐overloaded subjects have shown that 60% to 75% of the total dose is excreted renally as either DFP or its metabolite, DFP‐G  27 ,  29 ,  30 . In the current study, 75% to 95% of the administered dose of DFP was retrieved in the urine, as either DFP or DFP‐G. Based on currently available data, the remainder of the dose is likely eliminated in the faeces, via biliary excretion. It is possible that the factor of iron load, i.e. its presence  vs . its absence, is the reason for the apparent difference in total DFP excretion via the renal  vs . the faecal route between iron‐overloaded and non‐iron‐overloaded subjects. A recent publication noted a weak negative correlation between serum ferritin and GFR in patients with thalassaemia  8 . Should those findings be confirmed, additional studies should evaluate if the severity of iron overload also modifies the renal : biliary iron excretion ratio with different iron chelators. Irrespective of the severity of renal impairment, the majority of the dose was retrieved in the form of the metabolite. However, the extent of the dose excreted as DFP‐G decreased from 86% (healthy volunteers) to 73.2% (severe renal impairment), possibly due to biliary excretion becoming more prominent in renally impaired subjects. There was no evidence of regeneration of DFP from its glucuronide, as the AUC for DFP did not increase even in patients with severe renal impairment and no signs of secondary peaks in the PK profile were noted. About 80% of iron that is removed by DFP is via the renal route, although this varies among subjects. The elimination is presumed to be via filtration, not through an active or facilitated renal secretion pathway, but definitive data are lacking. A limitation of the study is that it did not measure elimination of the DFP‐iron complex. However, as this was a study in non‐iron‐overloaded subjects, it was not designed to enable the proper study of the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of the DFP‐iron complex. It is possible that there would be less iron removal as GFR declines, but that can be established only by studies in an iron‐overloaded population. Al‐Refaie and colleagues  27  conducted a study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of DFP in 24 patients with chronic iron overload given a single oral dose of ~50 mg kg −1 . The two patients in this sample who had renal impairment both showed impaired elimination of DFP‐G, resulting in high serum concentrations of DFP‐G. The results of that study indicated that elimination of DFP‐G is influenced by renal function, as there was a significant correlation between the rate of elimination of DFP‐G and creatinine clearance. While the authors, at that time, suggested that the lack of such correlation between elimination of DFP and creatinine clearance could be attributed to the differences in the sizes of the DFP and DFP‐G molecules, a more reasonable explanation is that the clearance of DFP is primarily via hepatic biotransformation, and DFP is only minimally excreted by the kidneys. Thus, systemic accumulation would not occur in the presence of decreased renal function. Using population pharmacokinetic methods, Bellanti  et al. 
 31  developed a pharmacokinetic model that included creatinine clearance as a covariate, allowing them to assess the influence of creatinine clearance on the disposition of DFP. This model was developed using data from 55 healthy volunteers. They concluded that dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with renal impairment in order to maintain similar exposure (AUC) to DFP in patients with normal renal function. These conclusions were based on the assumption that a reduction in creatinine clearance leads to a similar degree of reduction in total clearance of DFP which, as shown in the data presented here, is not the case. Since renal clearance of DFP accounts for only a minor portion of its total clearance (Table  1 ), it is predictable that impaired renal function would not result in increased serum concentrations of DFP. Similar elimination half‐lives in impaired renal function and healthy volunteers support this prediction. The short (2 h) half‐life of DFP after a single dose of 33 mg kg −1  DFP, even in subjects with severe renal impairment, also predicts lack of drug accumulation following multiple doses. DFP was well tolerated by all subjects. Most AEs occurred in HVs and subjects with mild renal impairment, with only two events reported by subjects with moderate or severe renal impairment. The differences in incidence may possibly be attributable to the effect of different clinical environments (the healthy and mildly impaired subjects were housed at a research site that specializes in phase 1 studies, while the other two groups were housed at a hospital). Also, the HVs may have felt more obligated to report all perceived reactions. Considering that this was a single dose open label study, the AEs that were observed may not be predictive of the AEs that might occur following long term treatment in patients with chronic renal impairment. It is also possible that the open label nature of the study biased the prevalence of safety events. Therefore, enhanced vigilance is warranted, even though no accumulation of DFP is likely to occur. In summary, the results of the present study indicate that adjustment of the DFP dosage regimen in patients with impaired renal function is unnecessary as the serum drug concentrations did not differ significantly from what is seen in patients without such impairment.

    <Body>The rapid and extensive expansion of the new betacoronavirus SARS‐Cov‐2 (CoVid‐19) is responsible for several thousand deaths in a very short time. This fast progression led the world health organization (WHO) to classify it as a pandemic on 11 March 2020. Waiting for the availability of new vaccines, this global emergency has triggered the search for safe and effective pharmacological approaches for eradicating the virus, or at least reducing its effects and hindering the contagion. Currently, great effort focuses on the repurposing of already available drugs based on the characteristics of the virus that have been so far defined. Thus, clinical studies are currently ongoing to evaluate the effects on SARS‐CoV‐2 of known drugs showing broad‐spectrum antiviral activity. This list includes favipiravir (plus interferon‐α ChiCTR2000029600; plus baloxavir marboxil ChiCTR2000029544), ribavirin, galidesivir (NCT03800173), remdesivir (NCT04252664 and NCT04257656), and chloroquine (NCT04261517).

  Moreover, tocilizumab (a monoclonal antibody anti‐IL6) is under clinical trial (ChiCTR2000029765) due to positive effects observed in coronavirus patients who showed serious lung damage and elevated levels of IL6. 
 3 
 
 Due to the genomic similarity (82%) with the previous SARS‐Cov virus (responsible for a major pandemic at the beginning of this century), other drug targets are also receiving attention. 
 4 
  Indeed, some viral components may be potential candidates for targeted therapies against SARS‐Cov‐2. Among these, two viral proteases necessary for viral replication, the papain‐like cysteine protease (PL pro ) and the chymotrypsin‐like cysteine protease 3CL pro , and the non‐structural protein 15 (Nsp15) (accessory protein for virus replication) have been proposed as potential targets. 
 5 
 
 Both SARS‐CoV and SARS‐CoV‐2 invade the host cell by interaction between the viral glycosylated spike protein and the human angiotensin‐converting enzyme‐2 (ACE2). Then, the binding between the virus and the host ACE2 is a key factor for initiating the viral infection. Moreover, this binding has been proposed to cause ACE2 downregulation; the consequent ACE2 deficiency and dysregulation seems to play a pathogenetic role in the progression of the overwhelming lung inflammation, observed in the most serious cases of CoVid‐19. 
 6 
 
 ACE2 is located on the surface membrane of host cells in particular on lungs, heart, and vascular endothelium and is specifically recognized and bound by the viral spike protein. 
 7 
  Therefore, interfering with the interaction between these two proteins may represent a useful pharmacological strategy. This strategy has been already used to fight the previous SARS‐CoV infection in 2003 and lead to the development of the ACE2 protein decoy APN01 (Recombinant Human ACE2; NCT00886353). APN01 is currently under evaluation in a Phase III clinical trial by Apeiron Biologics for treating CoVid‐19. Herein, we wish to focus on an original pharmacological strategy, which has never been proposed until now: the targeting of ACE2 with “small‐molecule” ligands, potentially able to induce conformational changes of ACE2 and thus to cause a possible reduction of the binding affinity between ACE2 and the viral spike protein. ACE2 (discovered in 2000) is an enzyme involved in the complex proteolytic pathway of the renin‐angiotensin system (RAS). In the last two decades, ACE2 modulation has been considered as an appealing strategy for cardiovascular therapies. 
 8 
  This led to the design of novel chemical entities, such as—for instance—the “small‐molecule” XNT, an ACE2‐activator which was evaluated in preclinical studies as a promising cardiovascular drug. Noteworthy, the binding of XNT to ACE2 was found to abolish the protein‐protein interaction between ACE2 and anti‐ACE2 IgG autoantibodies of patients affected by autoimmune diseases, 
 9 
  indicating that the conformational changes induced by a “small‐molecule” may effectively affect the binding affinity of ACE2 with ACE2‐binding proteins. Given the increasing interest towards ACE2 as a potential drug target, many drugs already approved by FDA for clinical use in heterogeneous human or veterinary diseases were evaluated, to identify a possible “off‐target” ACE2‐modulatory effects and thus to propose their “repositioning” in cardiovascular pathologies. 
 10 
  Some of these molecules exhibited heterogeneous structure and, consistently, induced different effects on ACE2, reasonably associated with different conformational changes of the protein. For instance, hydroxyzine increased the substrate specificity of ACE2, while diminazene and labetalol increased the maximal reaction rate and decreased the substrate specificity. Notably, no evidence of ACE2 downregulation by ACE2‐activators has been reported. Since spike protein and ACE2 interact with highest affinity and specificity (this may be a cause of the contagiousness of this virus), 
 11 
  the hypothesis that ACE2 structural modifications induced by one or more of these compounds could disturb a correct recognition between ACE2 and viral spike protein is plausible. Such an alteration may produce positive effects both in limiting the virus entry into the host cell and also in preventing the noxious virus‐induced ACE2 downregulation, which is triggered by the virus‐ACE2 binding. Remarkably, some of these compounds (Table  1 , from Kulemina and Ostrov 
 10 
 ) are already approved and are (or have been) clinically used for different therapeutic indications, including disorders of central nervous system, inflammation, parasitosis, and cardiovascular diseases. In some cases (i.e., fominoben, an old respiratory analeptic drug), their effects on the respiratory function can be an added value in CoVid‐19 patients. In any case, their pharmacological/toxicological profile is well‐established, and they are relatively “low‐cost” treatments. Thus, they should be submitted to rapid preclinical tests in specialized laboratories, evaluating their effects on ACE2‐spike protein interaction and/or on the ACE2‐mediated SARS‐CoV‐2 entry into the host cells. In the case of positive outcomes, the direct translation into the clinic would be sure and extremely rapid and facilitated.

    <Body>What is Already Known about this Subject 
 Inhaled salbutamol is accepted according to WADA guidelines within restricted doses. Urine is tested for violations of these restrictions, possibly resulting in punitive action. Inhaled and oral salbutamol administration follows complex pharmacokinetic profiles, including multiple ADME processes contributing to large variability in urine concentrations. This variability makes it doubtful that one can determine dose from a (single) urine concentration. WADA's assumptions of its appropriateness are insufficiently supported by the literature and general theory of drug disposition. 
 What this Study Adds 
 Simulations of salbutamol urine concentrations resulting from acceptable salbutamol usage (after inhaled therapeutic doses) in 1000 virtual subjects show that 1 h post‐dose, concentrations surpass the threshold of 1000 ng ml −1  in 15.4% of subjects. Conversely, unacceptable oral doses fall below the threshold within 48 h after the last dose. Our results show that single urine measurements do not allow estimation of the applied dose. The applied cutoff value of 1000 ng ml −1  is insufficient to differentiate between acceptable and unacceptable salbutamol use. Moreover, it is impossible to determine a cutoff value for this purpose with the current procedures. A semi‐physiological pharmacokinetic model was built using literature data. The possibility of the model to reasonably predict for several scenarios shows the power of model synthesis using prior literature data, allowing the evaluation of virtual scenarios using readily existing data. 
 Introduction Recently one of the most successful male cyclists of the last decade, Chris Froome, came into disrepute due to news of a potential doping violation. Doping control revealed a salbutamol (albuterol in the United States) concentration exceeding the allowed limit of 1000 ng ml −1  in a urine sample provided by the British rider during the Vuelta a España of 2017  1 . The WADA prohibited list indicates that salbutamol use is allowed in inhaled dosages up to “1600 micrograms over 24 hours in divided doses not to exceed 800 micrograms over 12 hours starting from any dose”, which is considered the maximum therapeutic dose for athletes with a so‐called Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE). Froome was in possession of such a TUE, but “the presence in urine of salbutamol in excess of 1000 ng ml −1  […] is presumed not to be an intended therapeutic use of the substance and will be considered as an Adverse Analytical Finding unless the athlete proves, through a controlled pharmacokinetic study, that the abnormal result was the consequence of the use of the therapeutic dose (by inhalation) up to the maximum dose indicated above.” Currently, over six months since the urine sample concerned, there is still no news of such a controlled study, which is perhaps not surprising: the burden is with the accused and setting up a robust study requires expertise. Additionally, inter‐occasion variability will influence the results of each attempt. 
 http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=558  acts on the  http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=29  as a sympathomimetic, commonly prescribed to counteract bronchoconstriction due to allergic and exercise‐induced asthma, as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  2 . This mechanism of action has led athletes to believe that there might be a performance‐enhancing effect of beta‐2 agonists both through relaxing smooth muscle cell in the lung, and anabolic effects on skeletal muscles. Two reviews extensively investigated the evidence for these effects and concluded that inhaled beta‐2 agonists have no positive effects on muscle strength, sprint or endurance performance, and that only high, systemic dosages can improve muscle strength and sprint performance, but not endurance performance  3 ,  4 . In summary, beta‐2 agonists might give an advantage in sports, but only at very high concentrations and for very short (power) disciplines. It is therefore doubtful that multi‐stage (endurance) cyclists like Chris Froome would benefit even from high doses of beta‐2 agonists apart from when treating asthmatic symptoms. Nevertheless, WADA is currently of the opinion that all beta‐2 agonists are banned substances, necessitating doping control measures. For this purpose, urine analysis is performed, which leads to a problem for the substances that are allowed with a TUE up to a maximum dose: salbutamol, formoterol and salmeterol. For these substances, urine concentration is used to determine whether the maximum dose was exceeded. It is, however, impossible to determine dose from a single urine concentration due to several pharmacological factors that are at play. Salbutamol plasma pharmacokinetics, in particular, are highly variable, mainly due to variability in lung and gut absorption, volume(s) of distribution, metabolism (including first‐pass effect) and renal clearance  5 ,  6 ,  7 . Subsequently, urine pharmacokinetics are even more variable due to the additional factor of urine concentrating abilities of the kidney (urine osmolality between 50 and 1200 mOsm kg −1 )  8 , volumetric production of urine  9  and micturition. On top of all this, the time since last dose in a doping control setting is unknown. Despite these facts, the WADA rules seem to assume that a urine concentration above the set threshold indicates a high chance of having detected use of more than the allowed dose. This chance is apparently considered sufficiently high to warrant sanctioning the athlete, but supporting evidence in literature is lacking. The aim of this study is therefore to evaluate the current WADA approach to this problem and determine whether this approach is able to differentiate approved use from violations. As a part of that aim, we evaluate whether WADA‐approved doses of salbutamol may lead to unacceptable urine concentrations, considering the multiple sources of variability, using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) approach. Methods Several literature data sources were used to synthesize a semi‐physiological pharmacokinetic model of plasma and urine salbutamol concentrations  5 ,  6 ,  7 . In short, a PK model of salbutamol in dogs was used as the basis and extrapolated to humans using allometric scaling  7 . Literature data on clearance of salbutamol and its main metabolite, sulphated salbutamol, was added to the base model  5 . A separate compartment was constructed to take into account the production of urine based on factors such as cardiac output and concentrating efforts of the kidneys  9 ,  10 . Further adjustment of parameters was performed to align a visual predictive check against literature data of salbutamol plasma and urine concentration from Haase  et al .  6 . All modelling was performed in an environment consisting of Piraña v2.8.1  11 , PsN v4.2.0  12  and NONMEM v7.3  13 . The statistical software R ®  v3.3.0  14  was used for pre and post‐processing of data, and statistical and graphical analysis. Literature model synthesis Several pharmacokinetic models exist for salbutamol in the literature; however, none of these include the urinary pharmacokinetics of salbutamol. A number of articles describe the concentrations of salbutamol in both plasma and urine without describing the parameters involved in the transfer of salbutamol between the two fluids. The only available model that approximates the absorption of salbutamol through both lungs and gut was built on data from dogs  7 . The model was implemented in NONMEM and the parameter values extrapolated to humans using allometric theory  15 . Variability on the fraction of inhalation absorbed through the gut and through the lungs was incorporated to account for inter‐patient variability in inhalation efficiency, and differences in inhaler types and formulations. The allometrically extrapolated model was further expanded by introducing a first‐pass effect of gut absorbed salbutamol to its main metabolite, sulphated salbutamol (S‐SAL). Furthermore, the renal clearances of salbutamol and S‐SAL were incorporated from pharmacokinetic parameters reported by Morgan  et al .  5 . Additional compartments for both salbutamol and S‐SAL in urine were constructed, assuming that when the compounds are eliminated from plasma at the clearance rates provided by Morgan  et al .  5 , they are directly introduced to urine without delay. A separate compartment was built to describe urine volume production, to allow voiding this compartment, similar to micturition, thereby better approximating physiology and allowing for the investigation of several micturition scenarios. Urine formation was assumed to occur at a constant rate, calculated using several physiological parameters, such as cardiac output (CO) scaled allometrically to weight (CO = 0.166·weight 0.79 )  10 . The CO for a typical person of 70 kg then is 4.76 l, with a coefficient of variance (CV) of 20%. Of this CO, 21% flows through the kidneys. Typical haematocrit is 0.409 (CV: 7%) in trained cyclists  16 , thus 59.1% of blood is plasma, with 19% of plasma entering the renal capsule. Of the resulting glomerular filtrate, 99.2% is reabsorbed, leaving 0.8% to leave the kidneys as urine. Combining these numbers, we calculate the urine production in litres per hour for a typical adult weighing 70 kg as follows  9 :
 (1) 4.76 L min − 1 * 60 min * 21 % * 59.1 % * 19 % * 0.8 % = 0.054 L h − 1 
 This amounts to 1.2 litres of urine per day, with a 95% prediction interval (PI) of 0.66–1.92 l day −1 , corresponding well with the typical volumes of 1–2 l day −1 . This also includes variability due to concentrating by the kidney. Cardiac stroke volume is increased in elite athletes, but due to reduced heart rate at rest, the cardiac output is not significantly different from normal healthy controls  17 . Although cardiac output is significantly increased (roughly threefold) during exercise, renal blood flow is restricted, leading to only a mild to moderate reduction in the urine production rate  18 ,  19 . Model validation and calibration We extracted data points of plasma and urine salbutamol concentrations from Haase  et al .  6  using ImageJ v1.50  20  and the Figure_Calibration plugin  21 . Haase  et al . administered 13 subjects with a single salbutamol inhalation of 1600 mcg, followed by regular plasma and urine sample collections. Validation of the synthesized literature model was performed through simulation of salbutamol plasma and urine concentrations in 1000 subjects (weight mean: 84 kg, SD: 17 kg), after a single 1600 mcg dose, and bladder voiding at the indicated time points where a urine sample was collected. The resulting simulated concentrations were compared to the plasma and urine concentrations over time in exercised, dehydrated subject data extracted from Haase  et al . and graphically presented in a visual predictive check plot  22 . Calibration of the parameters derived from the dog model was required, to better correspond to the Haase  et al . data (for further elaboration, see  Supporting Information Data S1 ). Model simulation Subsequently, we simulated a twice‐daily 800 mcg inhaled salbutamol administration at steady state (maximal allowed dose) in 1000 virtual subjects and determined the percentage of subjects attaining urine salbutamol concentrations above the 1000 ng ml −1  threshold to determine whether approved doses of salbutamol may lead to unacceptable urine concentrations. Finally, we also investigated a two‐week regimen of 8 mg oral salbutamol tablets (a dose shown to increase sprint power in elite athletes  23 ) in 1000 simulated subjects, to determine the length of washout period associated with non‐adverse findings in doping control. Both simulations (inhaled and oral dosing regimens) were used to evaluate whether the current WADA approach is able to differentiate approved use from violations.

Results Model synthesis The synthesized model consisted of eight compartments; one each for absorption through the gut and lung, one central and one peripheral distribution compartment for parent salbutamol, one central metabolite compartment, one salbutamol and one metabolite urine compartment, and a single urine volume compartment (Figure  1 ). When administered through inhalation, 20% of the dose reaches central circulation through the lung, with 80% of the dose ingested and absorbed through the gut. Half of the gut‐absorbed amount experiences a first‐pass effect and is absorbed as sulphate metabolite, with the other 50% reaching the circulation as unchanged salbutamol. Total apparent clearance of salbutamol parent drug is 13.1 l h −1  (of which 18.6%, or 2.4 l h −1  is the rate of conversion to S‐SAL), and clearance of S‐SAL is 5.9 l h −1 . The higher apparent S‐SAL clearance compared to conversion of salbutamol to metabolite in circulation explains why S‐SAL only accumulates after oral administration of salbutamol, and not in the case of IV administration  5 . Figure 1 Diagram representing final model structure. Arrows represent the flow of drug amounts. Bioavailability for lung and gut absorption after inhalation is represented as percentages. Lung‐absorbed amount is directly introduced into the central compartment and consists of 100% parent salbutamol. Of the amount absorbed from the gut, 50% is parent salbutamol and 50% is directly converted to sulphated salbutamol metabolite (first‐pass effect) Model validation After several adjustments of pharmacokinetic parameters (Table  1 ), plasma and urine salbutamol concentrations were adequately predicted, with only a minor bias, and reasonably similar variation bandwidth (Figure  2 ). The dual absorption peaks, distribution and elimination phases were well described. Table 1 Model parameters used in the simulations, with their source Parameter Typical value CV% Source

Right panel: urine concentrations Urine concentrations after appropriate salbutamol use Simulations of steady‐state urine concentrations over time resulting from a bi‐daily administration of the approved 800 mcg show a large spread, with a significant portion (15.4%) of the simulated population achieving urine concentrations above the threshold of 1000 ng ml −1  at the peak concentration at 1 h post‐dose (Figure  3 ). At 12 h after the dose administration, or right before the next inhalation, 0.7% of the population still showed urine concentrations above the threshold. It should be pointed out that these numbers do not take into account voiding the bladder before urine testing. In other words, Figure  3  shows the concentrations that would be measured at a certain time after administration when the bladder is voided for the first time since dose administration.

Within the first 24 h, the vast majority of subjects are already below the threshold, and after 2–3 days, none of the athletes will produce urine concentrations above the threshold. Figure 4 Simulated urine salbutamol concentrations after the last dose of a two‐week treatment with 8 mg oral salbutamol tablets, at regular micturition intervals of 8 h with a constant urine production rate. The last dose of steady‐state dosing is shown at 0 h, illustrating that levels decline to below WADA levels of 1000 ng ml −1  (dotted black line) well within 48 h of the last dose taken for 99.9% of the simulated study subjects. Red solid line: median predicted concentrations. Blue dotted lines: 99.9% concentration prediction interval Discussion We synthesized a model based on literature data alone that was able to adequately describe and predict the complex pharmacology of salbutamol in plasma and urine. The developed model was used to simulate possible outcomes of the maximum allowed dose of salbutamol in elite athletes, to show how current (WADA) standards for urine collection and analysis do not adequately take into account the large number of factors contributing to variability (dose amount and timing and physiological variability). This large variability leads to large uncertainty in determining the dose that was used, showing the implemented approach is not fit for purpose. It will lead to incorrect accusations of violation, whereas many violations will go unnoticed. Applied correction factors by WADA The general WADA rules for salbutamol use and control depicted in the introduction apply in all cases, but WADA describes two additional relevant specifics for the procedure. First, when collecting the urine sample from the athlete, the doping control officer will check the specific gravity of the urine produced by the athlete. If this is smaller than 1.005 when measured with a refractometer or smaller than 1.010 when measured with lab sticks, the athlete is required to provide further samples, until a suitable sample is collected  26 . The testing authority together with the laboratory decide which samples shall be analysed, although it is not clear on which criteria this decision is based. This procedure is presumably designed to prevent false negative findings due to diluted urine. However, it should be noted that due to bladder voiding for the first sample, the urine concentration of any subsequent sample will be driven by the plasma concentration at that moment and therefore potentially be a substantial underestimation, as plasma concentrations have fallen since dose administration. Correcting urine concentrations for urine osmolality (more accurate than specific gravity) of a sample would therefore be a much more rational way to normalize urine concentrations, and, in addition, avoid the need for multiple samples and their drawbacks. Secondly, WADA corrects a measured urine concentration for assay variability (measurement uncertainty) by adding to the threshold concentration a guard band. The guard band corresponds to the expanded measurement uncertainty of the assay giving &gt;95% coverage interval for a result at the threshold concentration based on a 1‐tailed normal distribution. It is calculated as 1.645 * ucMax (the maximum acceptable combined standard uncertainty of the assay, being 100 ng ml −1  for salbutamol), rounded up to two significant figures. A sample is determined to contain an adverse analytical finding only if the concentration is above the threshold plus the guard band, which is called the decision limit (i.e. 1200 ng ml −1  for salbutamol)  27 . When this decision limit is applied, 9.95% of subjects were above the limit at 1 h post‐dose in our simulated scenario. Throughout the rest of this article, the limit of 1000 ng ml −1  is used for clarity, as this is termed the threshold level by WADA, also in the Prohibited List. WADA deems it unnecessary to account for instability of salbutamol or its metabolite in urine, which potentially could impact measured salbutamol urine concentrations, as previous research shows that both salbutamol and its conjugate metabolites seem to be stable in urine  28 . Involving pharmacology So, the procedure involving specific gravity is rather dubious, and although the correction for assay variability seems appropriate, variability due to pharmacological processes are not discussed by WADA. Our developed pharmacokinetic model visualizes the underlying pharmacokinetic theory linking urine concentration and dose, namely, the administered dose being absorbed into the circulation and appearing in urine as a fixed proportion of the amount in blood (renal clearance). This concentration in urine varies with dose amount and time after dose, bioavailability and absorption rate from the lung and gut (for inhalation), distribution over the body, renal clearance, urine volume and voiding. From a clinical perspective, this is very similar to creatinine clearance, and as clinicians might know, it is impossible to calculate the ‘dose of creatinine’ using only a single urine concentration. Therefore, to be able to make an informed estimate of the dose, one would need to know factors such as the time of dose (which in the doping control setting they do not), the physiological variability of the athlete (not known), volume of urine over a timed period (not known) and the plasma concentration (not known). And because these factors are unknown in the doping control setting, dose cannot be determined from the urine concentration. This is exemplified by simulations from the model in Figure  3 , right panel, showing that even from a single dosing scenario, an extremely wide range of urine concentrations can be found. This would perhaps not be as problematic if a certain dose (the maximum allowed dose) would never lead to urine concentrations above the threshold for any subject, but our simulations show that this is not the case either. When collecting urine at 1 h (close to  t 
 max ), 15.4% of our simulated subjects are above the threshold if they did not void since dosing. Conversely, due to the large variability and the unknown frequency of voiding and time since dosing, there is also a high chance of finding urine concentrations below the threshold with doses above the maximum allowed dose. Given the relatively short half‐life of salbutamol, anabolic use (i.e. large oral doses) could even be halted shortly before a race, with no urine concentrations above threshold to be found by urine doping tests. Using our model, simulations of daily oral administration of 8 mg salbutamol over two weeks, with a washout period of 2 days resulted in 0% urine concentrations above the WADA threshold (Figure  4 ) when applying a normal micturition pattern (three times a day). Moreover, within 24 h, the majority of subjects would already produce a urine concentration below the threshold. This indicates that even high doses that have been shown to improve peak sprint power in elite endurance athletes  23 , will not lead to adverse analytical findings in the majority of cases if the athlete ceases dosing at least the day before an event. Burden of proof In the current situation, WADA does seem to acknowledge the problem of variability to some extent as an athlete that produced a urine sample with an unacceptably high salbutamol concentration, is given the possibility to prove this was a result of a dosing scheme within WADA limits by means of a controlled pharmacokinetic study. Hereby WADA transfers the responsibility of resolving the flaws in the rules designed by WADA itself to the athlete. Setting up such a study and getting the desired result will take months at least. And even if an athlete does prove their innocence, this could already do major damage to their reputation (see the Froome case); that is, if showing innocence is successful at all, as this might not prove simple. Although intra‐subject variability will be smaller than the previously described inter‐subject variability, substantial variability will still be present within a subject. It is therefore not unlikely that many trials will be needed to produce another urine sample that exceeds the threshold with allowed dosages, even more so because it will be difficult to reproduce the circumstances leading to the original finding. Aside from this being a very expensive and time‐consuming venture for the athlete, the fact that the foundation on which these WADA rules are based in the first place are flawed as we have shown, makes placing the burden of proof with the athlete completely unacceptable. Alternative solutions All these arguments make one wonder why the current procedure is being used by WADA. Speculation about a used dose of salbutamol from a urinary concentration (even when it would be adjusted for osmolality) is open to serious criticism and cannot be used to affect the career of an athlete. A better approach would be to collect timed urine samples over a specified period and possibly take a midpoint blood sample. In addition, S‐SAL concentrations in urine could be incorporated, as this metabolite would accumulate more, especially after oral dosing, due to slower clearance and the first‐pass effect. One may in fact use an approach using Bayesian hierarchical modelling, as proposed by Mu and Ludden, to determine the most probable dose and dose‐administration time  29 . Such an approach would require the development of an accurate population pharmacokinetic model of salbutamol (and S‐SAL) in cyclists, including salbutamol in urine, with samples corrected for osmolality. This approach could help approximate the dose, but would require large amounts of samples to be taken to achieve sufficient accuracy and precision. Without such dense data, uncertainty in estimating the dose would remain due to individual pharmacokinetic variability and the unknown factor of time since dosing. Given that the performance enhancing activity of beta‐2 agonists is dubious, especially in endurance sports, the question arises whether it is worth the effort of screening for these compounds. Limitations In this paper we reviewed the procedure implemented by WADA in the control for salbutamol doping and indicated that these are fundamentally flawed. Many of these problems are no different from those encountered in clinical practice and clinical pharmacology, and so the theory and knowledge from these disciplines were applied in this study to the issue of doping control. We developed a population pharmacokinetic model based on literature data to substantiate and quantify that theory, but there are some limitations to the model. No individual data on both plasma and urine concentrations were available for model development, such as that of Haase  et al .  6 . Such data would allow proper estimation of inter‐individual variability, leading to better prediction of concentration bandwidths. However, given the good performance of the visual predictive check in Figure  2 , there does not seem to be overprediction of the variability in urine concentration. The results of this visual predictive check also make it unlikely that inter‐laboratory or inter‐assay differences would impact extrapolation of our model to the WADA doping control laboratory setting: the pharmacokinetic analysis in the study used for the plot was performed by the WADA‐accredited doping control laboratory in Norway  6 . Furthermore, variability on physiological parameters could only partially be based on actual data. For example, data on additional variability due to the extreme circumstances during professional cycling is not available and thus could not be accounted for. Two variabilities were fixed to 23% (omega = 0.05), which is typically referred to when discussing physiology, and deemed reasonable. In addition, several parameters originally derived from dogs required manual adjustment to properly align with the Haase  et al .  6  data. Furthermore, the salbutamol concentration in the doping control assay used by WADA is based on the sum of the glucuronide conjugate (expressed as the free drug) and free salbutamol concentrations. For the purpose of this study, we did not explicitly take into account the glucuronide conjugate of salbutamol, as its contribution to the concentration measured in urine is only very limited, with concentrations below the lower limit of detection of 2 ng ml −1  in 100% of subjects after inhalation of 800 mcg of salbutamol and 70% of subjects after oral administration of 8 mg (and &lt;3% compared to the unconjugated salbutamol for the remaining subjects)  30 . However, if there is an impact, this would only add to the variability in observed urine concentrations. Similarly, this variability might increase if we incorporated variable urine production (due to increased fluid intake or dehydration) rather than a constant urine production rate that was applied in the model. Finally, our model is supported by data from a clinical study  30 , reporting that out of 28 subjects (including eight asthmatic elite athletes) inhaling a single dose of 800 mcg of salbutamol, there was one subject with a urine concentration above the 1000 ng ml −1  threshold when analysing the urine sample taken 4 h post‐dose (urine collection between 0 and 4 h). This means in this study, 3.6% of subjects exceeded the urine concentration threshold with allowed use, which is similar to the observed 3.0% when simulating 1000 subjects with our model in this scenario, supporting the validity of our model. Our approach therefore shows the feasibility of modelling exercises, including integration of pre‐clinical and clinical data, with the possibility of clinical trial simulations/not‐in‐trial simulations and optimal design. Above all, we show that this approach, originating from traditional clinical pharmacology, can also be applied in this setting of doping control. Conclusion Pharmacokinetic theory dictates that it is not possible to derive the administered dose with any certainty from a single random urine concentration when there is no information about timing of the dose, urine volume or osmolality and individual physiological variability. Using a pharmacokinetic model based on literature data, we substantiated this notion. We demonstrate that the current approach to detect excessive salbutamol use is fundamentally flawed and cannot differentiate between illegal and allowed use and inadvertently leads to incorrect assumptions of violation. If the community is determined to control for excessive salbutamol use, these procedures should be changed. The expertise present in the field of clinical pharmacology is clearly relevant in doping control, and we therefore advocate a closer collaboration between the two disciplines to work towards a sport that is as clean and fair as possible. Competing Interests There are no competing interests to declare. J.H. is a recreational cyclist and is a fan of professional road cycling, but, other than as a spectator and from its clinical pharmacology aspects, is not involved in the sport. S.v.D. and A.C. watch professional cycling but are mainly excited by its clinical pharmacology aspects. Supporting information

    <Body>What is already known about this subject 
 Clonidine is used as a sedative agent in intensive care unit patients, although clinical studies have been sparse. The use of clonidine as an off‐label additive sedative is common practice; however, hospitals have reported a wide range of dosing regimens. Levels of sedation adequate for tolerating invasive or uncomfortable procedures seem to be in the range of 1.5–4.0 μg/L of clonidine. 
 What this study adds 
 A population pharmacokinetic model for clonidine was developed in adult intensive care patients and can be used to simulate and explore dosing regimens. Simulations revealed a dosing regimen of 1200 μg/d (50 μg/h) results in 95% of the virtual population attain clonidine concentrations &gt;1.5 μg/L at steady state. A loading dose of 150 μg, which is common practice, reduces the time to reach steady state only minimally. An effective loading dose, that avoids peaks in serum concentration, is to double the infusion rate for 6 hours. 
 1 INTRODUCTION Adequate sedation and analgesia are crucial for patients in intensive care units (ICUs) to tolerate tracheal tube, artificial ventilation and other ICU procedures. Ideally, sedative agents should have minimal adverse effects and preferably no interactions with other drugs. Current sedation medication consisting of  propofol ,  midazolam  and  lorazepam  have potential adverse effects such as increased morbidity and prolonged ICU duration, and they may provoke delirium.

  The presence of delirium may result in an increased hospital and ICU length of stay.

 In recent years, α‐2 adrenergic agonists have been used as an additive treatment to the standard sedation regimen.

 Alpha‐2 adrenergic  agonists produce both sedative and analgesic effects with minimal respiratory depression.

 Clonidine  is a potent α‐2 adrenergic agonist and its sedative and analgesic effects have been investigated in clinical studies.

 The optimal therapeutic range of clonidine for the purpose of sedation has not been determined. The sedative effects of clonidine were illustrated in an experiment by Hall  et al . who administered different doses of IV clonidine to healthy volunteers. Significant reduction in observer‐assessed sedation was measured at plasma concentrations of 1.96 (± 0.5) μg/L. 
 5 
  Dose dependent sedation was observed in all subjects. The authors remarked that subjects remained rousable throughout the experiment, even at higher doses of clonidine. A condition in which patients are comfortably asleep, but can easily be roused, is often desired in ventilated critically ill patients. This may explain why clonidine has found use as a sole sedative or as an adjunct to sedation in many ICUs. We found only 1 study in which serum levels of clonidine in adult patients during intensive care sedation were measured, reporting levels from 1.5 to 6.0 μg/L. 
 8 
  Although some self‐reported sedation has been described at serum levels below 1.5 μg/L, 
 9 
 ,  
 10 
  higher degrees of sedation may be required to treat discomfort in the ICU. Another study, in healthy volunteers, showed significant reduction in observer‐assessed sedation at serum levels of 1.5–5.0 μg/L. 
 6 
  For the purpose of the present pharmacokinetic study, we defined an optimal level for ICU sedation ranging from 1.5 to 4.0 μg/L. Clonidine is known to produce haemodynamic effects, which are mediated through both the heart and the peripheral vascular system. Clonidine reduces the heart rate, although severe bradycardia is uncommon, 
 11 
  and it decreases the blood pressure. 
 6 
  It exerts these effects through the activation of presynaptic α 2 ‐adrenoceptors in the central nervous system and through activation of α 2 ‐adrenoceptors in vascular endothelial cells.

 In many ICUs in Europe, Asia and Canada, the use of intravenous clonidine as an off‐label additive sedative is common practice. However, hospitals have reported a wide range of dosing regimens, which may vary up to 10‐fold. 
 7 
  Dosing regimens are presented in Tables S1–4. Currently, adult population pharmacokinetics (PK) of clonidine have not been investigated in the ICU setting. The aims of this study were to investigate the PK of clonidine in critically ill patients in the ICU and to develop a population PK model to suggest a dosing regimen for the usage of clonidine as sedative. 2 METHODS 2.1 Study design and drug regimen This study was approved by the medical ethics review committee (METC Isala Zwolle) and was registered in the  ClinicalTrials.gov  database (NCT02466373). Intubated and sedated patients admitted to the ICU of the Deventer Hospital with an expected stay of 3 days or more were included, after written proxy consent. The following criteria were used to exclude patients: age &lt; 18 years, neurotrauma, postanoxic coma, use of clonidine 96 hours before start of the study, bradycardia, severe hypotension, hypertensive emergency, pregnancy and lactation, epilepsy, clonidine intolerance, liver cirrhosis, recent and acute myocardial infarction, severe heart failure, and second or third degree AV‐block without a permanent pacemaker or renal failure. Patients received clonidine after standard sedation with morphine, combined with midazolam or propofol was initiated. A total of 24 patients were divided into 3 treatment groups of 8 subjects receiving continuous IV infusions of clonidine of 600, 1200 or 1800 μg/d (infusion rate of 25, 50 or 75 per hour, respectively). Four patients in each treatment group, received a loading dose of 50% of the daily dose in 4 hours. This was an open label trial and randomisation was not applied. 2.2 PK measurements Blood samples were taken from arterial catheters at 2, 4, 8 and 12 hours after the start of clonidine infusion. Subsequently, a sample was taken once daily until the termination of treatment. After stopping the infusion, blood samples were taken at 0, 8, 16, 24 and 48 h. Blood samples were stored at −20°C and transferred to Amsterdam University Medical Centre AUMC for analysis. Plasma concentrations were measured using a validated high‐perfomance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry system (liquid chromatography: LC30 UPLC, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan; mass spectrometry: QTRAP 5500 system, Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA), as described previously by Kleiber  et al . 
 14 
  The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 0.1 μg/L and the upper limit of quantification was 20 μg/L. The accuracy of the assay was between 99–114%. 2.3 Population PK model development A population PK analysis was performed using nonlinear mixed effects modelling (NONMEM 7.3 ICON Development Solutions, Hanover, MD, USA), using the first‐order estimation method with the interaction option and subroutine ADVAN13, TOL6 Pirana (version 2.9.8), R (version 3.4.1) and PsN version (version 4.6.0). The population PK model was developed in a stepwise sequence, first developing a structural model, followed by attributing interindividual variability (IIV) to the PK parameters, again followed by refining the appropriate residual error model. Lastly, covariate relationships were established with PK parameters, to potentially reduce the unexplained IIV. Model selection criteria were based on change in the objective function value (OFV), goodness‐of‐fit plots, precision of parameter estimates, decreases in IIV and residual variability, condition number, shrinkage and successful convergence step, with at least 3 significant digits in parameter estimates. 
 15 
 
 2.3.1 Structural and statistical model One‐, 2‐ and 3‐compartment models were evaluated to describe the PK of clonidine. For structural model selection, a decrease in OFV of 3.84 units or greater between nested models was considered statistically significant, which corresponds to  P &lt;  .05 assuming a χ 2  distribution. IIV in model parameters was estimated using an exponential model, assuming a log‐normal distribution, as shown in equation  (1) ,
 (1) θ i = θ pop × exp η i where  θ i  is the individual parameter value,  θ pop  is the population mean parameter value and  η 
 i  is a random variable from normal distribution with a mean of zero and estimated variance of  ω 
 2 . For the residual error model, additive (equation  2 ), proportional (equation  3 ), and combined error models (combination of equation  2  and  3 ) were tested, in which  Y 
 ij  was the individual concentration prediction at time  j , and  ε  is the residual error originating from a normal distribution with a mean of zero and estimated variance of  σ 
 2 .
 (2) Y ij = f θ ηi x ij + ε ij 
 (3) Y ij = f θ η i x ij × 1 + ε ij 
 2.3.2 Covariate model The influence of body weight, body surface area (BSA), body mass index, height, age, sex, creatinine clearance (CLcr), albumin, bilirubin, time after infusion and continuous veno‐venous haemofiltration (CVVH) status of the patient was evaluated on the PK parameters using a forward selection–backward elimination procedure. Allometric scaling based on body weight was applied to the PK parameters (equation  4 ).
 (4) θ pop = θ pk × Bodyweight 70 θ exp 
 In which,  θ pop  is the population mean value,  θ pk  is the mean PK value, and  θ exp  is the allometric scaling exponent for clearance (CL) with an allometric exponent of 0.75. While the power exponent was fixed at 1 for central volume of distribution (V1). For other covariates, a power function was utilised and centred around the median value of the covariate (equation  5 ) or a linear function was utilised (equation  6 ), using the following equation:
 (5) θ pop = θ pk × Cov Cov median θ exp 
 (6) θ pop = θ pk × 1 + Cov × θ slope 
 Equation  6  was also used for time after start of clonidine infusion on CL, in which  θ pk was the CL, Cov was time in hours and  θ slope  represented the slope of the CL. The categorical covariate CVVH was incorporated using indicator variables. The coding was illustrated using an indicator variable 0 for non‐CVVH patients and 1 for CVVH patients. CLcr was calculated by using the Cockcroft–Gault formula, 
 16

 17 
  or using 24‐hour urine creatinine clearance. 
 18 
  BSA was calculated by the Du Bois formula, 
 19 
  and the CLcr estimations were converted to mL/min to adjust for the patient's individual BSA. All CLcr equations were tested separately in the model and compared regarding their significance in OFV decrease. The CLcr equation with the largest significant decrease in OFV will be retained in the model. A priori, graphical plots of  posthoc  Bayesian estimates  vs the co variates were generated to explore possible covariate relationships. For forward selection, an OFV decrease by 3.84 units or greater (corresponding to  P  &lt; .05) indicated that the covariate had a significant effect on the model fitting. The full covariate model was obtained when all significant covariates were introduced into the model. In backward elimination, covariates were eliminated 1 by 1 from the full covariate model and an increase in OFV of 6.63 units ( P  &lt; .01) or greater was required to retain the covariate in the final model. 2.3.3 Handling data below the LLOQ During model development, LLOQ data values were replaced by LLOQ/2 as described by Beal. 
 20 
  In the final PK model 3 different methods used for handling data below LLOQ were evaluated 
 21 
 : (i) below LLOQ data were replaced by LLOQ/2, (ii) below LLOQ data were discarded; (iii) below LLOQ data were treated as categorical data and the likelihood of the below LLOQ data assume that the value is less than the LLOQ. The method with the highest precision of parameter estimates was chosen as the final PK model. 2.4 Internal model validation A bootstrap was performed to estimate the uncertainty of the population PK and parameters and to evaluate the stability of the model. Five hundred bootstraps were performed and the median, 2.5 th  and 97.5 th  (denoting the 95% confidence interval) of the population parameters were determined and compared with the estimates of the final model. A visual predictive check was conducted by simulating 500 individuals using the final PK model in NONMEM. The median and 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the simulated data were calculated and compared with observations to evaluate the predictive performance of the final PK model. 2.5 Monte Carlo simulations Using the PK parameter estimations, IIV and residual variability from the final population PK model, stochastic Monte Carlo simulations were performed for 1000 virtual patients to design a dosing regimen for sedation. The bodyweight of the simulated patients followed a normal distribution from 53 to 113 kg with a mean of 84 kg, representing the patient population in the original study. Dosing regimens were considered clinically relevant if 90% of the patients reached concentrations &gt;1.5 μg/L at steady‐state loading doses were evaluated to reduce the time to achieve steady state. Practical considerations, such as easy preparation (clonidine comes in 150 μg/mL ampoules) and unambiguous prescription, also played a role in choosing the final dosing schedule. 3 RESULTS 3.1 Population PK modelling 3.1.1 Structural model development The study population consisted of 24 adult patients, 16 men, 8 women. At the start of treatment, the median age was 67 (range 25–83) years and body weight 84 (range 53–113) kg. Further characteristics of participants are presented in Table  1 . Continuous infusion was briefly terminated for 2 hours in 1 patient due to short hypotension.

Patients gave an average of 12 [range 5–16] samples per individual. Individual concentration–time profiles were explored prior to population PK modelling (Figure  1 ). A 2‐compartment structural model adequately described the concentration–time profiles of clonidine. The residual variability was described using a combined additive and proportional error model. The IIV was estimated on only CL and V1. IIV was omitted on Q and V2 due to large IIV (&gt;125%) and these parameters proved relatively unstable from run to run. FIGURE 1 Individual clonidine concentration: time profiles on semi‐logarithmic scale. Numbers 9–32 indicate the ID numbers of the patients. Patients 9–12 received clonidine 600 μg/d; patients 13–16 received 600 μg/d with a loading dose of 300 μg in 4 hours; patients 17–20 received 1200 μg/d; patients 21–24 received 1200 μg/d with a loading dose of 600 μg in 4 hours; patients 25–28 received 1800 μg/d; and patients 29–32 received 1800 μg/d with a loading dose of 900 μg in 4 h. The horizontal grey solid line denotes the total infusion duration. The thick horizontal grey solid line represents the duration of the loading dose, while the thin horizontal grey solid line represents the duration of the maintenance dose. In patient 11, continuous infusion was terminated for 2 hours due to hypotension 3.1.2 CVVH patients Three patients were treated with CVVH. The CL and V1 of CVVH patients were estimated separately as well together with the non‐CVVH patients. The OFV difference between these models was &gt;3.84 units, indicating that the CL and V1 values of CVVH patients were not significantly different compared to non‐CVVH patients. 3.1.3 Covariate model development Univariate analysis showed a significant effect ( P  &lt; .05) of time after start of clonidine infusion on CL, and of body weight, CLcr, albumin and bilirubin on V1. Table  2  displays the covariate model development. Allometric scaling based on body weight was applied to V1 with an exponent of 1, in which the exponent was not significantly different from unity. For the remaining covariates a linear model was used. Afterwards, all significant covariates were added into a full covariate model. After backward deletion, only time after start of clonidine infusion on CL and body weight on V1 were significant covariates ( P  &lt; .01). TABLE 2 Covariate model development Model no.

Eleven samples (2.8% of total amount of samples) were below the LLOQ. Of all the evaluated methods for handling data below LLOQ, discarding these data resulted in the highest precision of PK parameter estimates.

The visual predictive check for the final model is presented in Figure  3 . Overall, the 2.5th, 50th and 97.5th percentiles of observed concentrations were within the predicted 95% confidence interval (CI) of these percentiles, demonstrating good predictability of the final population PK model. The median values of the parameter estimations of the bootstraps were approximately equal to the final model's respective values, thus indicating that the PK parameter estimates from the final model were precise and the model was robust (Table  3 ).

Shaded areas depict the model predicted 95% confidence intervals of the simulated percentiles 3.2 Simulations to optimise dosing regimens We examined the possibility of using the same dose for every patient. Simulations with daily clonidine doses of 1200 μg for 4 days showed that the target clonidine level of 1.5 μg/L or higher would be achieved at steady state in 95% of the simulated patients (Figure  4A ). FIGURE 4 Simulations of 1000 individuals using continuous intravenous (IV) clonidine for 4 days in patients 53–113 kg, mean 84 kg. A, Continuous IV clonidine of 1200 μg/d (50 μg/h); B, continuous IV clonidine of 1200 μg/d (50 μg/h) and 150 μg IV bolus in 30 minutes; C, continuous IV clonidine of 1200 μg/d (50 μg/h) and 600 μg loading dose in 6 hours. The solid lines represent the median value, while the dashed lines represent the 5 th  and 95 th  percentile, respectively. The shaded grey areas depict the 90% prediction interval Lower doses were simulated but resulted in &lt;90% of the simulated patients reached 1.5 μg/L at steady state (data not shown). Thus, a dosing regimen 1200 μg/d was recommended. When we simulated the administration of 1200 μg/d as a continuous infusion without a bolus, it took 14.5 hours for 50% of the population to reach the target concentration. We tested 2 strategies that are used in ICU practice to reduce the time to achieve steady state. The strategy encountered most is to give an IV bolus of 150 μg at the start of infusion. 
 7 
  In Figure  4B  we simulated the administration of 150 μg in 30 minutes. It resulted in a sharp rise in plasma concentration, followed by a steep drop, and the time to achieve the target concentration is reduced from 14.5 to 11 hours. Another strategy, which is popular among clinicians because it is easy to prescribe, is to double the infusion rate for several hours at the beginning of infusion. Figure  4C  depicts the predicted plasma concentrations when the clonidine infusion of 1200 μg/d (50 μg/h) is preceded by 6 hours of infusion at a rate of 100 μg/h. There is no peak in plasma concentration, and the time to achieve target is reduced from 14.5 to 5 hours. Therefore, a loading dose of 600 μg in 6 hours would seem optimal. Since body weight was a covariate on V1, clonidine concentrations during the loading dose would be dependent on the patient's body weight. To investigate the body weight effect on clonidine concentrations, the loading doses were stratified in body weight &lt;80 and &gt;80 kg. Simulations showed that differences in clonidine concentrations were small (25%) after 4 h, when stratifying on body weight (data not shown). Therefore, we suggest a loading dose independent of body weight. 4 DISCUSSION The present study describes the population PK of clonidine in critically ill adult patients that provides a basis for dose optimisation for sedation. In our population PK model, time after infusion was the only covariate to have a significant influence on the CL of clonidine. CL increased linearly with 0.213%/h from baseline. The population CL was 17 L/h at the start of the treatment and increased to 20.4 L/h after 4 days on continuous infusion, which was the median treatment duration in this study. The reason for the increase in clonidine clearance over time is unknown, but it might reflect the recovery of organ function during stabilisation of critical illness. The increased clearance might have an effect on steady‐state concentrations, and it would seem rational to adjust the dose after several days of infusion. However, the Monte Carlo simulations showed that this effect was modest in the first few days of treatment. The population V1 was 124 L/70 kg in our study. A central volume larger than the actual volume of body water suggests distribution to tissues. Body weight, introduced into the equation by allometric scaling was a significant covariate on V1. One would expect this to have an influence on the loading dose required. Our PK parameter estimates correspond with previously published studies. Keranen  et al . reported a CL of 8–18 L/h/70 kg and V1 of 119–175 L/70 kg, 
 9 
  which lends credibility to our results. Although 3 patients received CVVH, our analysis did not show any significant difference in CL between patients who received CVVH and patients who did not received CVVH. Clonidine may potentially be removed by CVVH because of its low molecular weight (230 g/mol) and low protein binding (20–40%). 
 22 
  Another effect that may mask the significant effect of renal function and renal replacement therapy on CL is that almost 50% of clonidine is cleared by the liver.

 23 
  The small number of patients in our study may have reduced the power to identify liver and kidney function as covariates. The CL in both CVVH and non‐CVVH patients were similar in our study, However, our study only included 3 CVVH patients and thus of relatively low power. Many ICUs in the Netherlands are using clonidine for additional sedation. A survey showed that continuous infusion rates varied from 240 to 2400 μg/d. 
 7 
  The optimal target range or clonidine for sedative purposes has not been established, but previous literature suggest that it might be in the order of 1.5–4.0 μg/L. Accepting that, a fixed dose of 1200 μg/d by continuous infusion would maintain that level for several days in 95% of patients, irrespective of body weight, as is shown in Figure  4 . The simulations also illustrate that the effect of time on steady state concentration is limited, obviating the need for dose adjustments after several days of infusion. Dosing by body weight, as has been used in several studies, would not improve steady state levels by much, and therefore seems unnecessary. Our simulation suggested that a loading dose of 150 μg had little effect on the time to reach steady state. When loading doses were simulated stratified to body weight &lt;80 and &gt;80 kg, differences in clonidine concentrations after 4 hours were small (&lt;25%, data not shown). Therefore, despite a significant effect of body weight on V1 in our model, we recommend a standardised loading dose independent of body weight. When clonidine is added to other sedatives that are titrated down while the sedating effect of clonidine effect is building up, the time to reach steady state may not be considered clinically important. When clonidine infusion is started without a loading dose, 50% of patients will reach serum concentrations in the target range after 14.5 hours. However, when a more rapid effect is desired, our population PK model for clonidine in ICU patients suggests a loading dose of 600 μg in 6 hours to attain target sedation concentrations of &gt;1.5 μg/L within 5 hours in 50% of the simulated patients. This study had some limitations. A potential limitation of our study is the small sample size. This might have caused potentially important covariates to be not significant. IIV on CL and V1 were estimated as 33.3 and 66.8%, respectively. This relatively high variability in PK estimations could be explained by heterogeneity in critically ill population, with large differences in organ function and drug metabolism. Another limitation is the target concentration range for sedation is not well defined in current literature. The safety and efficacy profiles are crucial to limit the risk of procedural failure, discomfort, extension of sedation, and deeper sedation levels than intended for the procedure. Therefore, the range of target concentrations for achieving optimal sedation need further investigations. In conclusion, our data provide the description of population PK of clonidine in critically ill ICU patients. Our results suggest that a dosing regimen of 1200 μg/d would provide clonidine concentrations adequate for sedation in a wide range of patients.

    <Body>What is Already Known about this Subject 
 Dose changes in the label occur frequently (~20%) in the post‐marketing phase of new substances. Most often these dose changes are downward adjustments related to safety concerns. Limited information about dose changes is available for biologicals. 
 What this Study Adds 
 In 11% of the biologicals the dosing information for the initial indication was changed in the post‐marketing phase. For biologicals dose changes were rarely a reduction because of safety reasons. No changes in dosing information for extended indications were observed during follow‐up. 
 Introduction The drug dose aims to optimally balance efficacy, tolerability and safety when treating patients. The drug label, also called the Summary of Product Characteristics in the European Union, informs health care professionals as well as patients about the recommended dose for a given indication. The dose of a (biologic) drug in first‐in‐man studies is determined based on non‐clinical data and subsequently further established in clinical studies. For biologicals, it is different and more difficult to predict their clinical effects from non‐clinical data than it is for small molecules because of the complex protein nature of biologicals  1 ,  2 . Specifically, immune reactions such as hypersensitivity reactions and the formation of anti‐drug antibodies are effects for which prediction by animal models is difficult  3 . Also, evidence generation from (non‐)clinical trials can be limited by various factors such as the relatively small sample size, the homogeneity of the included population, and the lack of long‐term follow‐up. Studies conducted after marketing authorization of a new drug, including clinical trials, patient registries and large population‐based database studies, aim to provide more information about the efficacy and safety. This post‐marketing data can lead to changes in different sections of the label of the product, including the section on dosing information. Previous research showed that the dosing information in the label changed in the post‐marketing setting for 21% of new active substances approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 1980 and 1999  4 . In the majority (71%) of the label changes, the dose was reduced, implying that patients may initially be exposed to higher doses than acceptable or needed for the optimal treatment  4 . These FDA approval‐based findings prompted the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to perform a study on EMA‐approved new active substances which showed a comparable frequency in label changes  5 . In addition, it was shown that major issues regarding the dose were raised for 10% of the new active substances during the assessment of the marketing application  5 . Dose changes are most often implemented in order to optimize the risk–benefit balance. The ipilimumab example (Box  1 ) illustrates the difficulties that companies as well as regulators face when finding the dose with the optimal risk–benefit balance for biologicals. Besides increasing the total dose for efficacy‐related reasons, the dose can also be increased to prolong the duration of the effect. Due to the pharmacokinetic properties of biologicals, the target can become saturated. In that case the duration of the effect is prolonged  6 ,  7 . Box 1 Example difficulties faced in dose tuning Ipilimumab, a monoclonal antibody activating the immune system by targeting CTLA‐4, was approved in the European Union in 2011 for the treatment of advanced melanoma  22 . The recommended dose for ipilimumab was 3 mg kg −1  every 3 weeks based on the pivotal phase three study. However, there were uncertainties whether the 3 mg kg −1  dose induces the maximum pharmacological effect as the pharmacodynamics marker of immune cell activation was increased for the 10 mg kg −1  dose compared to the 3 mg kg −1  dose. Also, a phase two study had indicated that the 10 mg kg −1  dose may be more efficacious though accompanied by an increased number of serious adverse events. As there were multiple differences between those two studies it was not possible to directly compare the results  22 . Based on this information it was concluded that it was not fully clear whether 3 mg kg −1  is the optimal dose for ipilimumab. Therefore, at approval the regulatory authorities decided that the company should commit to perform a study comparing the efficacy and safety of 3 mg kg −1  with 10 mg kg −1 . Results of this study became available in 2017 and confirmed that the 10 mg kg −1  dose resulted in a significant increase in overall survival compared to the 3 mg kg −1  dose, but also in more (serious) adverse events  23 ,  24 ,  25 . The results of this study were included in the label, however, not in the section on dosing information  23 . Dose changes can also be introduced as part of the extension of indication. The dosing information for a new therapeutic indication may then differ from the dosing information for the initial indication. For example, rituximab was initially indicated for non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma at EU approval in 1998 with a recommended dose of 375 mg m −2  body surface area per cycle  8 . In 2009, the indication was extended to include another haematological cancer type, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia  8 . The recommended dose is 375 mg m −2  body surface area in the first cycle followed by 500 mg m −2  body surface area in the subsequent cycles. Also, the indication was extended to include a non‐oncology indication, rheumatoid arthritis, with a recommended dose of 1000 mg followed by a second 1000 mg 2 weeks later  8 . As described, difficulties are faced in establishing the optimal dose. However, little is known about changes in dosing information for biologicals during the post‐marketing phase. Our study aimed to provide insight into the frequency and nature of post‐marketing label changes in dosing for the initial indication of EMA‐approved biologicals. Also, changes in the dosing information for the extended indications were assessed. Methods We included biologicals authorized between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2014 via the centralized procedure of the EMA. According to EMA's definition, biologicals are products produced by or extracted from a biological source  9 . We defined biologicals more strictly as recombinant therapeutic (glyco) proteins, thus excluding vaccines, diagnostic proteins, and blood‐derived products. Information on the approval circumstance (normal, conditional, under exceptional circumstances) and orphan designation (yes, no) of the biologicals was retrieved from the EMA website. Furthermore, biologicals were classified into the mechanistic classes of antibodies, cytokines, enzymes, growth factors, hormones, interferons, receptors and other/various  10 . The product assessment history was retrieved from the EMA website and was used to determine whether a label change in dosing information for the initial indication had occurred and whether the indication was extended. If the assessment history did not provide sufficient information on the occurrence of a label change in dosing, the regulatory assessment report was consulted through the database of the Dutch Medicines Evaluation Board. The biologicals were followed up until 31 December 2016 or until the date of withdrawal if a product was taken off the market. Incidence of dosing information changes in the drug label, type of dosing information change and time to the dosing information change in the drug label change were assessed. We defined a change in dosing information in the label for the initial indication as an increase or decrease in the dose per dose interval, including increase or decrease in the frequency of administration, the dose given per administration, or the duration of the treatment period, and other dose changes (e.g. change in dosing frequency without a change in total dose; 200 mg every 2 weeks changed to 400 mg every 4 weeks). First, the incidence of the occurrence of change in dosing was assessed by dividing the number of changes by the number of biologicals in the cohort. Relative risks, including 95% confidence interval for the occurrence of the first change in dosing for the different determinants, was measured using Cox regression. A Kaplan–Meier analysis was performed to analyse the time to a label change in dosing. If the dosing of a product had changed more than once, only the first change was taken into account for the Kaplan–Meier analysis. The data analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows, version 24.0. In addition to the changes in dosing information of the initial indication, we determined whether the indication was extended during follow‐up. When the indication was extended, the dosing information of the extended indication was compared to the dosing information of the initial indication. The incidence of these differences, type of difference (increase, decrease, other) and time to first extension of indication were assessed. Furthermore, it was assessed whether the dosing information for the extended indications changed during follow‐up by comparing the dosing information for the extended indication described in the label at time of the extension of indication to the dosing information in the label for the extended indication at end of follow‐up. The labels were obtained from the publicly available community register of medicinal products of the European Commission. Results A total of 71 biologicals were included in this study ( Appendix 1 ). Most of the biologicals ( n  = 64, 90%) were authorized under normal circumstances and did not have an orphan designation ( n  = 58, 82%). About a third ( n  = 23, 32%) of the biologicals were hormones, followed by antibodies ( n  = 22, 31%) and growth factors ( n  = 10, 14%). Within the follow‐up time, a total of five biologicals (pegloticase, rilonacept, filgrastim ( n  = 2), eptotermin alfa), were withdrawn from the market, all for commercial reasons. Within the median follow‐up time of six years (range: 2–10 years), the dosing information in the label for the initial indication was changed for eight products (cumulative incidence: 11%), as shown in Table  1  and Figure  1 . Table 1 Biologicals whose dosing information was changed in the label for the initial indication Biological Disease category  26 
 Description of the label change in dosing information Time to change (years) 
 Abatacept 
 Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue Treatment may be initiated with or without the previously required intravenous loading dose. 6.9 
 Canakinumab 
 Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue Increase in the maximum dose from 300 mg or 4 mg kg −1  every 8 weeks to 600 mg or 8 mg kg −1  every 8 weeks. 3.3 
 Certolizumab 
 Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue Addition of an alternative dosing regimen (400 mg every 4 weeks) to the approved dosing regimen (200 mg every 2 weeks) for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. 4.2 
 Corifollitropin alfa 
 Diseases of the genitourinary system Increase in dose for patients &gt;36 years and whose weight is between 50 and 60 kg from 100 μg to 150 μg. 4.8

 Diseases of the genitourinary system Addition of an alternative dosing regimen (0.6 μg kg −1  once every 2 weeks) to the approved dosing regimen (1.2 μg kg −1  once a month) for patients who are not on dialysis and not currently treated with an erythropoiesis stimulating agent. 3.1 
 Ranibizumab 
 Diseases of the eye and adnexa Change in dosing regimen, which is driven by monitoring of the stability of the disease. The initial dosing regimen was based on three initial monthly injections and re‐treatment in case of loss of vision. 4.6 
 Romiplostim 
 Diseases of the blood and blood‐forming organs and certain disorders involving the immune mechanism Downward revision in cut‐off value of thrombocyte count for the recommendation to decrease the dose and to interrupt the treatment. 1.8 
 Tocilizumab 
 Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue Removal of the recommendation for a minimum dose (480 mg) and addition of a maximum dose for patients &gt;100 kg (800 mg). 1.4 Figure 1 Nature and frequency of label changes in dosing information for the initial indication ( n  = 71) The time to the label change ranged from 1 to 7 years after marketing authorization with a median time to a change of 4 years (Figure  2 ). Figure 2 Kaplan–Meier curve for the change in the dosing information of the initial indication For certolizumab and methoxy polyethylene glycol‐epoetin beta, an alternative dosing regimen with the same total dose was added to the initial dosing regimen. For ranibizumab, the recommended dosing regimen was changed to a less restrictive regimen. For canakinumab and corifollitropin alfa, the dose was increased, whereas for abatacept and romiplostim, the dose was decreased. For romiplostim, the decrease in dose was related to safety. For tocilizumab, the minimum dose was removed and a maximum dose was added. For three products within the cohort, more information about dosing became available after marketing authorization, but the outcomes of these studies did not warrant updates of the recommended dose in the label. We were unable to identify factors related to the label change in dosing information because the sample size was limited. For 30 products (42%), the indication was extended at least once during follow‐up with a median time to the first extension of three years (range: 1–7 years). The dose for the extended indication differed from the dose of the initial indication in 15 out of the 30 first extensions of indication (50%), as shown in Figure  3 . For 14 products, the indication was extended more than once, resulting in a total of 59 extensions of indication. The dosing for the extended indication differed from the initial dosing in 32 out of these 59 extensions (54%). Furthermore, it was observed that for certolizumab and ranibizumab, the extension of indication was accompanied by a change in dosing information for the initial indication. During follow‐up, the dosing information for the extended indications ( n  = 59) was not changed. Figure 3 Nature and frequency of differences in dosing information in the label between the initial indication and the first extended indication ( n  = 30) Discussion For biologicals, more uncertainties exist about safety at the time of approval than for small molecules  11 . However, our study did not show that the dose of biologicals was reduced more often because of safety issues as compared to small molecules. Only one label change included a clear decrease in dose related to safety (romiplostim); the cut‐off value warranting a decrease in dose was lowered to minimize the risk of thrombotic complications and was implemented following an international consensus report on the investigation and management of primary immune thrombocytopenia  12 . This is in contrast with the previous study on FDA‐approved new active substances, which showed that the dose changes occurred more frequently and the dose change was mainly decreased in these products (71%)  4 . Four of the changes (abatacept, certolizumab, methoxy polyethylene glycol‐epoetin beta, ranibizumab) observed in our study involved (additions of) alternative dosing regimens that reflected a less invasive approach for the patients' convenience  13 ,  14 ,  15 ,  16 . The remaining three changes (canakinumab, corifollitropin alfa, tocilizumab) were considered efficacy‐related changes implemented to optimize the risk–benefit balance. Comparable findings were shown in a study evaluating the rationale of dose selection for FDA‐approved biologicals in the pre‐approval phase. This study showed that clinical efficacy attributed to the dose finding in 73% of the biologicals, whereas clinical safety attributed in 42% of the biologicals  17 . The extent to which dose changes occur may have been underestimated in our study as in clinical practice dose changes may be introduced based on experience from clinical practice. For example, in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with TNF‐alfa‐inhibitors, the dose can effectively be down titrated  18 , but down titration is currently not reflected in the label. Moreover, the recommended dose for rituximab in rheumatoid arthritis patients is 1000 mg followed by a second 1000 mg dose 2 weeks later. However, as of today, discussion is still ongoing whether this dose is the optimal dose and in clinical practice patients are often treated with 500 mg instead of 1000 mg  19 ,  20 . More recently, focus in clinical research has also shifted towards tapering of doses for medicines originally recommended for lifelong treatment, e.g. eculizumab, which may have beneficial economic effects  21 . Finally, the dose for the extended indication differed from the dose of the initial indication in half of the first extensions of indication. This indicates that research on dosing continues for extended indications, which may in the end also affect the dosing for the initial indication. In fact, we observed that for two products (certolizumab, ranibizumab), the extension of indication was accompanied by a change in dosing information for the initial indication. In the post‐marketing phase, it may be equally important to emphasize finding the best dose for biologicals from an effectiveness  and  safety perspective rather than from a safety perspective only. In conclusion, this study showed that in approximately one out of ten EMA‐authorized biologicals, the recommended dose changed post‐marketing for the initial indication. For the first extended indication, a dose difference between the initial and new indication was observed in one out of two biologicals. The dosing information for the extended indications was not changed during follow‐up. In contrast with what previous research has reported for the dose of small molecules, the initial dose of biologicals was almost never reduced for safety reasons.

    <Body>What is already known about this subject 
 Adverse effects of anticholinergic medicines are exaggerated in older adults with dementia and may worsen symptoms of dementia. Recent campaigns have encouraged clinicians to put more focus on appropriate use of medicines for older adults. 
 What this study adds 
 Despite their antagonistic pharmacological effects, current real‐world evidence shows that 1/3 of patients initiating dementia medicines were exposed to anticholinergic medicines up to 180 days before or after. There is a myriad of guidelines on managing symptoms of dementia; however, deprescribing medicines with questionable benefit among patients with dementia are complicated by conflicting recommendations, especially approaches to manage co‐existing morbidities. 
 1 INTRODUCTION Nearly 50 million people worldwide are currently living with dementia. 1 ,  2  Cholinesterase inhibitors and  memantine  (dementia medicines) are the approved pharmacological mainstays and part of the standard care for managing the symptoms of dementia but they do not reverse or stop its progression. 3 ,  4 
 Dementia medicines have the potential to cause agitation, insomnia and incontinence 5  and these unwanted effects might lead to initiation or increased use of anticholinergic medicines. 6 ,  7 ,  8 ,  9  Additionally, older adults with dementia are commonly prescribed medicines with anticholinergic properties to treat comorbidities such as depression, and anxiety and this further complicates therapy with dementia medicines. 10  Anticholinergic medicines may cause cognitive impairment, confusion, loss of concentration and delirium, which are exaggerated in older adults with dementia. 5 ,  11 ,  12 ,  13  Moreover, use of anticholinergic medicines may reduce the therapeutic effects of dementia medicines. A recent population‐based study investigating the effect of high anticholinergic burden after starting cholinesterase inhibitors found that concomitantly use of anticholinergic medicines had a negative impacted on the treatment response to cholinesterase inhibitors, leading to treatment modification, delirium and mortality. 14 
 In an attempt to reduce variation in the management of dementia and to improve quality of care, best practice guidelines including those of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and American Psychiatric Association now recommend medicine reviews at the time of diagnosis to reduced irrational medicine use in patients with dementia. 15 ,  16 ,  17 ,  18 ,  19  These reviews also provide an opportunity to identify and rule out any reversible cause of confusion such as adverse effects of other medicines or untreated comorbidities. 20  Recommendations on improving clinical outcomes have been updated; however, decisions on reducing potentially inappropriate combinations of medicines, such as concomitant use of dementia and anticholinergic medicines are challenging due to lack of clarity in guidelines for managing comorbidities in patients with dementia. 16 
 In Australia, few studies have investigated the use of anticholinergic medicines at the time of initiating dementia therapy. 21 ,  22  Most recently, Gadzhanova and colleagues 22  used 2009–2010 dispensing data to show that approximately 1/3 of patients initiating dementia medicines are exposed to anticholinergic medicines, in particular, antipsychotics. 21 ,  22  Since then, guideline recommendations have been updated to increase awareness of concomitant medicines use and its impact on the clinical outcomes in patients with dementia and a number of campaigns such as Choosing Wisely Australia® have encouraged clinicians to put more focus on appropriate use of medicines for older Australians. 23  This calls for updated evidence of anticholinergic medicines exposure among patients with dementia to further guide policy on prescribing practices. In this study we aimed to provide contemporary real‐world evidence of anticholinergic medicines use among patients initiating dementia therapy. We examined which anticholinergic medicines were most commonly dispensed before and after initiating dementia medicines. We further sought to identify if patients were prescribed anticholinergic medicines by a prescriber other than the one initiating pharmacological treatment for dementia. 2 METHODS 2.1 Data source and study setting In Australia, all citizens and permanent residents are entitled to subsidised access to prescribed medicines through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). We used anonymised nationwide 10% random sample of PBS‐eligible people and their dispensing history. This standard dataset is provided by the Australian Government Department of Human Services for analytical use and has been previously described in detail. 24  It captures information on all dispensed PBS‐listed medicines including patient age, sex, date of dispensing, prescriber information and other variables. All medicines are uniquely identified by item codes and the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification codes. PBS item code provides medicine details at the product level, including generic name, form, strength, administration route, quantity per unit (pack size) and approved indication, where applicable. 24 
 We extracted data from 1 July 2012 through to 31 December 2017 and examined cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine dispensings from 1 January 2013 to 30 June 2017 (study period). 2.2 Medicines of interest We included 3 cholinesterase inhibitors subsidised under PBS for the management of cognitive impairment in patients with mild to moderately severe Alzheimer disease:  donepezil  (ATC code N06DA02),  rivastigmine  (ATC code N06DA03) and  galantamine  (ATC code N06DA04). We also included memantine (ATC code N06DX01), a N‐methyl‐d‐aspartate receptor inhibitor which is subsidised for patients with moderately severe to severe Alzheimer disease. There is a wide range of medicines with anticholinergic effects. We limited the selection of these medicines based on a previously published list by Kalisch Ellett and colleagues 13  who used medicines listed on the anticholinergic risk scale and the anticholinergic drug scale to show associations between anticholinergic medicine use and risk of hospitalisation with confusion or dementia. 13  Table  S1  lists these medicines, their ATC codes, therapeutic use and medicine class. 2.3 Study cohort and medicines exposure Our study comprised all adults in the PBS 10% sample, aged ≥60 years, who were initiated cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine during the study period and continued dispensings for at least 180 days. We defined initiation of therapy to be the first dementia medicines dispensing after a period of at least 180 days, during which no dispensing of any dementia medicines had occurred. We assumed that the person had remained on therapy for at least 180 days, if they had ≥5 dispensings of their dementia medicines within 180 days after the date of initiation. We required ≥5 dispensings for donepezil, galantamine and memantine 20‐mg tablets as they are available in 28‐day pack sizes for once daily dosing and oral formulations of rivastigmine are available in 56‐capsule packs for twice daily dosing. For memantine 10‐mg tablets, we required only ≥3 dispensings, as the available pack size is 56‐tablet packs and can be used as once‐daily dosing. 25 
 We defined exposure to anticholinergic medicines  before dementia therapy  as any dispensing of an anticholinergic medicine 1–180 days prior to initiating dementia medicines. We defined exposure to anticholinergic medicines  after initiation of dementia therapy  as any dispensing of an anticholinergic within 180 days after initiating dementia medicines (i.e. including same day dispensings of an anticholinergic medicine with cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine). Figure  S1  demonstrates the selection of the study cohort and their exposure to medicines with anticholinergic effects from the period 180 days before and until 180 days after. 2.4 Data analysis We described the patient characteristics, their exposure to anticholinergic medicines and calculated the number and proportion of patients exposed to anticholinergic medicines before and after initiating dementia medicines by medicine class (antidepressants, anti‐Parkinson's, antipsychotics and other anticholinergic) and specific medicines. We also estimated the number of patients with anticholinergic medicine dispensings by each 30‐day period up to 180 days before and 180 days after initiating dementia medicines. We used the McNemar's test to estimate the difference between the proportion of patients dispensed anticholinergic medicines from before to after initiation of dementia medicines. Finally, we examined the proportion of patients prescribed at least 1 anticholinergic medicine written by a prescriber other than the one who initiated the dementia medicines.

 3 RESULTS Our cohort comprised 4393 older adults who initiated dementia medicines and remained on therapy for at least 180 days. Just over half (56%) of the cohort were female, 70% were aged between 75 and 89 years and 69% initiated donepezil as their dementia treatment (Table  1 ).

Of those exposed, nearly 2/3 (59%) were dispensed antipsychotic medicines.  Risperidone  was the most common anticholinergic medicine dispensed (29% of those exposed), followed by prochlorperazine (18%), amitriptyline (16%), quetiapine (14%) and oxybutynin (13%). The proportion of patients exposed to anticholinergic medicines in each 30‐day period ranged from 9.7 to 10.7% during the 180 days before initiating dementia medicines and from 13.0 to 13.5% after initiating dementia medicines (Figure  1 ). Figure 1 Proportion of patients dispensed anticholinergic medicines by each 30‐day interval from 180 days before to 180 days after initiating dementia medicines We observed a 2.5% absolute increase in the number of patients dispensed anticholinergic medicines after initiating dementia medicines with the largest increase in the concomitant dispensing of antipsychotics (10.1%). We found that more patients were dispensed risperidone and quetiapine after initiating dementia medicines (7.3 and 2.3% respectively) than during the 180 days before such therapy (Table  2 ).

Among patients who were dispensed anticholinergic medicines after initiating dementia medicines (with or without prior exposure), we found that nearly half (537/1133) had their anticholinergic medicines prescribed by a prescriber other than the one who initiated dementia therapy. 4 DISCUSSION Dementia is a progressive disease and medicines for dementia might slow the cognitive decline. Our study provides insight into recent real‐world use of medicines for dementia and the prescribing of medicines with anticholinergic effects in this population. Current recommendations encourage a medicine review at the time of dementia diagnosis and thereafter to reduce potentially inappropriate medicine use, yet we found that anticholinergic medicines were commonly dispensed to our cohort. The results of our study mirror the findings of previous studies conducted almost a decade ago using PBS dispensing data, 21 ,  22  suggesting that there has been little change in prescribing practices among patients dispensed dementia medicines. These results occur against a backdrop of increasing emphasis on the importance of evidence‐based practice and calls for improved prescribing in this vulnerable population. Our findings are also comparable to international studies. In a very recent systematic review, Hukins and colleagues identified anticholinergic medicines as among the most commonly prescribed potentially inappropriate medicines among patients with dementia, with rates of prescriptions ranging from 6 to 46%. 27 
 There is a myriad of guidelines on managing symptoms of dementia; however, they often lack depth, consistency and/or consensus and the overall recommendations on managing comorbidities are generally weak and/or based upon insufficient evidence. 28  This leads to increased challenges for clinicians with ever‐extensive clinical responsibilities and makes it difficult to determine what approach to take. For instance, concurrent use of anticholinergic medicines is not recommended with cholinesterase inhibitors; however, the primary pharmacological management for behavioural and psychological disturbances in dementia are antipsychotics such as risperidone. 15 ,  18 ,  28 ,  29 ,  30 ,  31 ,  32 
 In our study, the antipsychotic risperidone was the most commonly dispensed medicine with anticholinergic effects both before and after initiating dementia medicines. Under PBS restrictions, risperidone formulations are only eligible for government subsidy for managing behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia; thus accounting for the substantial number of dispensings captured in our data. 33  The safety and efficacy of risperidone and other commonly dispensed antipsychotics such as quetiapine and olanzapine use in patients with dementia remains uncertain. 30 ,  34 ,  35 ,  36  Clinical trials such as the CATIE‐AD study conclude that adverse effects offset advantages in the efficacy of antipsychotics in the management of psychosis, aggression or agitation in patients with Alzheimer disease. 37 
 Other anticholinergic medicines commonly co‐dispensed among our study cohort, such as prochlorperazine, loperamide, oxybutynin and amitriptyline, may have been used to manage the adverse effects of dementia medicines, such as nausea, diarrhoea, agitation, insomnia and incontinence. 5  This suggests that the initiation of dementia medicines may have led to a prescribing cascade 7  and use of medicines with the potential to worse cognition, among other adverse effects. This might be most obvious with the prescription of the anticholinergic medicine oxybutynin to manage urinary symptoms that results from therapy with dementia medicines. 11 
 Patients with dementia experience more comorbidities, may receive a higher number of medicines and visit multiple prescribers in comparison to their cognitively intact counterparts, which leads to fragmentation of care. 27 ,  38 ,  39  In our study, we found that nearly half of the cohort who were co‐prescribed anticholinergic and dementia medicines visited multiple prescribers. This may have contributed to polypharmacy and irrational combinations of pro‐cholinergic and anticholinergic medicines. For example, drug‐interaction software can only work if both medicines are recorded in the same system, and prescribers would be familiar with the medicines they choose to prescribe but might be ignorant of others. Our study has some notable limitations. Medicines with anticholinergic effects have multiple indications and, from our dataset, we could not determine the reason for which they were prescribed. Thus, we were unable to confirm for each case, if anticholinergic medicines use could have been avoided. In addition, we did not have dosing information and hence could not measure dose reductions of specific anticholinergic medicines after a patient initiated dementia medicines. 5 CONCLUSION Anticholinergic medicine use among patients living with dementia needs further attention from clinicians. Despite high‐quality evidence of the risks associated with their use, anticholinergic medicines continue to be commonly dispensed in this vulnerable population. Decisions about the use of medicines with questionable benefit among patients with dementia are complicated by conflicting recommendations in prescribing guidelines, especially approaches to manage co‐existing morbidities. Periodic monitoring such as medicine reviews at the time of dementia diagnosis and thereafter may help prescribers identify and reduce potentially inappropriate medicine use and its detrimental effects.

    <Body>Introduction Many side effects or adverse reactions to medicines are predictable and are accepted risks of treatment. They can be avoided or minimized by careful medicine prescribing and use  1 . Adverse drug events (ADE) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality  2 , 3 , and elevated health care costs  2 , 4 , 5 . It is thought that genetic testing could reduce the number of adverse drug events. The application of pharmacogenetic testing in routine clinical care to individualize drug selection, dose and treatment duration has been studied in the areas of cancer, antiretroviral and cardiovascular drug therapies  6 – 10 . In response to this growing body of genetic and clinical evidence, the US Food and Drug Administration has issued over 150 drug label recommendations related to pharmacogenetic biomarker testing. The Clinical Pharmacogenetic Implementation Consortium has issued a series of guidelines on genotype-guided drug prescribing including for warfarin, clopidogrel, abacavir and tricyclic antidepressants  11 – 14 . Despite the guidelines and experimental research there remains a lack of consensus concerning the clinical applicability of pharmacogenetic tests  15 . Genetic factors are known to make the largest contribution to inter-patient variability in warfarin dose requirements  16 . Even though warfarin is the most commonly prescribed oral anticoagulant and a leading cause of ADEs  12 , 17 ,  VKORC1  and/or  CYP2C9  genotype-guided warfarin dosing fails to improve anticoagulation outcomes  18 , 19 . However, previous evidence has been mixed. Some studies have demonstrated clinical utility such as improved time in target range with genotype-guided warfarin dosing  20 – 22 . Recently, two large RCT reports that evaluated genotype-guided warfarin dosing have stimulated further debate, as they tested related hypotheses yet arrived at different results  6 , 23 . These studies vary considerably in follow-up duration and dosing method, yet they are similar with respect to size and choice of primary outcome (time in therapeutic range). The emergence of new evidence and controversy regarding the clinical effectiveness of using genotype-guided warfarin dosing  16 , 24 , 25  indicates a need for a systematic review of genotype-guided dosing. The reality of clinical practice is that many patients are on multiple medications and multi-morbidity is now the norm. The consequence is that in primary care and many other settings it is less useful to use a single drug/genetic tests but to use a broader set of tests for multiple drugs. No systematic review has been published that estimates the effectiveness of genotype-guided drug prescribing that is not restricted to the classic single drug/genetic tests approach. This study examines the current randomized controlled trial evidence for the prospective clinical use of pharmacogenetic information to improve effectiveness of drug prescribing as demonstrated by reduced harm and increased relative effectiveness. Methods Study design This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized control trials (RCTs) to answer the question: does genotype-guided prescribing reduce ADEs and improve drug treatment response? Search strategy Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and pharmgkb.org databases were searched from January 1980 through December 2013. Pharmgkb.org is a pharmacogenomics knowledge resource that gathers, curates and distributes knowledge about the influence of human genetic variation on drug responses. The search strategy was developed by the authors with a librarian and piloted in Medline (Table  1 ). Reference lists from reviews and included articles were searched for relevant items by SW and RG. Abstracts were downloaded for articles considered to be potentially relevant and the inclusion criteria were then applied to these articles by two independent reviewers (RG, DD, SW). Disagreements were resolved through discussion.

We excluded studies that retrospectively determined the association of genotype with drug response. Data extraction Independent double data extraction was performed using pre-designed and pilot-tested forms (RG, DD, SW). We contacted the authors of the included studies when reported outcome data were inadequate for meta-analysis. We extracted data on study design, clinical and safety outcomes. Any disagreements between the reviewers were resolved by discussion. For the purposes of this review, minor bleeding is defined as a bleeding event that required no additional testing and treatment, major bleeding is categorized as fatal bleeding, symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, or a fall of haemoglobin requiring hospitalization or blood transfusion and thromboembolism is defined as a deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or embolic stroke and the percentage of time in the therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) range was defined as between 2.0 and 3.0, except by Anderson  et al .  18  (1.8 to 3.2), Burmester  et al .  36  (2.0 to 3.5), Hilman  et al .  19  (1.9 to 3.0) and Huang  et al .  37  (1.8 to 3.0). Assessment of risk of bias and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias in each included study according to Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias  26 . Any disagreements between the reviewers were resolved by discussion. Data synthesis was performed using Review Manager version 5.2  27 . Where the interventions were the same, or similar enough, and if there was no important clinical heterogeneity, we synthesized results in a meta-analysis. For measures of effect we used risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for binary outcomes and mean differences (MD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Due to significant statistical heterogeneity, we synthesized the data using a random effects analysis. All analyses included all participants in the treatment groups to which they were allocated (intention-to-treat analyses) as far as possible. Meta-analyses based on the random effects model were performed for warfarin dosing studies for percentage time in therapeutic INR, and for warfarin related minor, major and thromboembolism ADEs. Heterogeneity was assessed using I 2  statistics, which is the proportion of total variance observed between the trials attributed to the differences between trials rather than to sampling error. I 2  &lt; 25% was considered as low in heterogeneity and I 2  &gt; 75% was of high heterogeneity  28 . Results Study characteristics Fifteen of 6686 identified studies satisfied the inclusion criteria (Figure  1 ) and evaluated clinical outcomes of genotype-guided interventions for 19 different drugs (Table  2 ). Studies analyzed a total of 5688 patients, varying in size, ranging from 26 to 1650 participants in the analysis of the primary outcome. Demographic characteristics of participants varied between studies. Of the 13 studies reporting ethnicity, one was 100% Caucasian participants and two studies were carried out with a 100% Chinese population. Studies were carried out in hospital settings in various countries, with the largest study being an international study involving 19 countries.

Follow-up times for these studies ranged from 7 days to 4 months. We identified nine RCTs evaluating genotype-guided warfarin dosing as vitamin K antagonist therapy for various indications  6 , 18 , 19 , 21 , 23 , 35 – 38 . Seven of nine studies involved a combination of indications including atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, two studies included prosthetic valve and joint patients, one included pre-operative orthopaedic patients and two studies initiated warfarin prior to heart valve replacement. All nine studies reported on drug specific clinical effectiveness outcomes, with eight evaluating warfarin related ADEs and time within therapeutic INR, and five evaluating outcomes of adverse drug events. Seven studies used different dosing models for their genotype-guided and control dosing arms, whereas Huang  et al . and Wang  et al . used the same dosing algorithms for both genotype-guided and control and Kimmel  et al . and Pirmohamed  et al . used the same pharmacogenetic but different control algorithms  6 , 23 , 37 , 38 . For the genotype-guided arm, two studies used dosing models that accounted only for  CYP2C9  variants, while all other studies incorporated both  CYP2C9  and  VKORC1  variants and one study incorporated  CYP2C9, VKORC1  and  CYP4F2  variants. Follow-up times for our outcomes of interest (warfarin related ADEs and time within therapeutic range) ranged from 14 days to 12 weeks. Risk of bias for all studies Four studies were of very high methodological quality with all items categorized as low risk of bias (Figure  2A ) and a further three were of high methodological quality with all items categorized as low risk of bias except one that was uncertain/unclear risk of bias. The greatest source of bias was observed in performance bias, the blinding of participants and personnel (Figure  2B ). Figure 2 Risk of bias.

In renal transplant patients receiving tacrolimus either according to CYP3A5 genotype or according to the standard regime the proportion within the targeted therapeutic trough concentration ( C 0 ) after six doses was 43.2% (95% CI 36, 51.2)  vs.  29.1% (95% CI 22.8, 35.5), respectively,  P  = 0.03  33 . In patients infected with immunodeficiency virus type 1 excluding HLA-B*5701-positive patients, in the experimental arm, abacavir treatment resulted in a reduction in the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions, OR 0.03 (95% CI 0.00, 0.62,  P  &lt; 0.001)  29 . The other four non-warfarin trials did not show statistically significant improvements in the primary outcome that they defined. It was not possible to perform a meta-analysis on these studies due to clinical heterogeneity. Genotype-guided warfarin dosing Time within therapeutic INR range Data were available for meta-analysis from eight studies, the study by Burmester  et al .  36  was not included as data were available for only the first 14 days, when the estimate of the median times to stable therapeutic dose were 31 days (95% CI, 23, 36). A total of 1952 patients from seven studies are included in the meta-analysis (Figure  3 )  6 , 18 , 19 , 21 , 23 , 35 , 37 . The statistically significant mean difference is 6.67% (95% CI 1.34, 12.0) time within therapeutic international normalized ratio range, in favour of genotype-guided warfarin dosing. There is considerable heterogeneity in this analysis, I 2  = 80%.

Unpublished data from one study was used in this analysis. There was a total of 251 events observed, 107 in the genotype-guided group and 144 in the control group. The RR was significant, RR = 0.57 (95% CI 0.33, 0.99), with moderate heterogeneity, I 2  = 60%.

Size of square reflects the study statistical weight, the horizontal lines indicate 95% confidence intervals (CI) and the diamond indicates summary risk ratio estimate with the corresponding 95% CI Discussion The aim of this systematic review was to examine the evidence for the prospective clinical use of genotype information to improve the effectiveness of drug prescribing as demonstrated by reduced harm and increased relative effectiveness. Previous reviews have focussed on the use of genotype-guided prescribing for a single drug and we aimed to use a broader approach. We identified a reasonable size of literature relevant to our aim, but it was only possible to meta-analyze the studies of warfarin dosing. The limited literature outside warfarin dosing may reflect that warfarin is a commonly prescribed drug with a narrow therapeutic index and a wide variation in the dose required to reach therapeutic range. While there is an increase in RCTs that go beyond using genotyping to evaluate warfarin dosing, high level evidence is lacking regarding the clinical utility of testing for genetic variations associated with drug response. This is the first systematic review to incorporate data from the two most recent warfarin genotype-guided dosing RCTs, demonstrating that the use of genotype-guided dosing increases time within therapeutic international normalized ratio range, mean difference 6.67% (95% CI 1.34, 12.0). This is not in accordance with a 2012 systematic review that states  ‘there is little evidence to support the use of genotyping, which conflicts with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) statement. … Our overall findings are in accordance with an older systemic review that did not find sufficient evidence to support the use of pharmacogenetics to guide warfarin therapy (Kangelaris, 2009). In addition, an editorial by Ansell, 2009 notes, “most problematic is that the intervention arm of each trial is considerably different”. Therefore, current use of genotyping is not underpinned by the evidence and should be discouraged.’ 
 39 . The differences of opinion are partially due to the studies used in the systematic review. They included Anderson  et al .  18 , Burmester  et al .  36  Caraco  et al .  21  and Hillman  et al .  19 . Borgman  et al .  35 , Kimmel  et al .  23 , Pirmohamed  et al .  6  and Wang  et al .  38  were not published at the time of their review, an added 1509 patients. However there is still significant variability in terms of design quality, medical indication, length of follow-up and intervention design, indicating that our meta-analysis of time within therapeutic range should be interpreted with caution. For the warfarin studies there were differences in study design related to the experimental  vs.  control algorithms employed to determine loading dose and in some cases dose revision and/or maintenance. For example, whereas the pharmacogenetic experimental loading dose and dose adjustment protocols were similar in the two most recent RCTs, the control dosing protocols were very different. Kimmel  et al .  23  used CYP2C9 + VKORC1 genotype and the Gage clinical variable algorithm  vs.  the Gage clinical variable algorithm, Pirmohamed  et al .  6  used CYP2C9 + VKORC1 genotype and the Avery clinical variable algorithm  vs.  10 mg on day 1 and 5 mg on day 2. Kimmel  et al .  23  saw no difference in time within therapeutic INR range, whereas Pirmohamed  et al .  6  saw a modest difference in time within therapeutic INR range. The benefits of the genetic components of the pharmacogenetic algorithm in the study by Pirmohamed  et al .  6  are hard to separate from the benefits of the clinical algorithm. It has been suggested that it was not surprising that differences were not seen between the Kimmel  et al .  23  trial arms as they were comparing two multivariate models  16 . The contribution of genetic variables to the success of warfarin dosing could have been masked by the fact that using a clinical only multivariate model for dose prediction and adjustment that requires rigorous INR testing and management is highly likely to be substantially better than real world settings that have standard local practice. There are six genotype-guided warfarin dosing trials registered in clinicaltrials.gov that are currently actively recruiting or completed and awaiting study results. One of these is a large RCT of an estimated 1600 patients (the GIFT trial), which will compare therapeutic warfarin dosing using genotype and clinical information with warfarin dose requirements using clinical information only. This trial is powered for ADEs as a primary outcome measure ( http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01006733?term=NCT01006733%26 ). Our results are not definitive because of the statistical heterogeneity between trials. Although the overall quality of the included studies was high there was evidence of performance bias in many of the studies. This was mitigated by use of a ‘hard’ outcome measure, of ‘time within therapeutic INR range’. In summary, this study has examined the evidence for the prospective clinical use of genotype-guided prescribing to improve effectiveness of drug prescribing and the evidence supports the use of genotype-guided prescribing for warfarin, tacrolimus and abacavir. RCTs of the more pragmatic clinical approach of using a multidrug/SNP process to inform prescribing need to be undertaken.

    <Body>What is already known about this subject 
 Dapagliflozin is registered for clinical use at therapeutic doses of 5 and 10 mg once daily based on dose finding studies that targeted urinary glucose excretion as the primary glycaemic efficacy parameter. 
 What this study adds 
 This study indicates that the exposure–response relationship for glycaemic markers differs from the exposure–response relationships of cardiorenal risk markers. As a consequence, the optimal glycaemic dose of dapagliflozin might be different than the optimal cardiorenal dose. Dose finding for cardiorenal indications should ideally be based on a panel of markers. 
 1 INTRODUCTION The  sodium–glucose co‐transporter‐2 (SGLT‐2 ), located in the S1 segment of the proximal tubule of the kidney, regulates glucose reabsorption and plays an important role in glucose homeostasis.

  The modest reduction in HbA1c and the observed early time course of a reduction in events in the DECLARE‐TIMI 58 trial as well as findings from other clinical trials indicate that these beneficial effects of dapagliflozin are unlikely to be explained by improvements in glycaemic control.

  Other mechanisms, such as the reduction of plasma volume as a consequence of the natriuretic effects of dapagliflozin, have been proposed to explain the beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on heart and kidney failure.

  As the efficacy of SGLT2 on clinical outcomes appears to be largely independent of glycaemic control, this raises the question of whether glycaemic parameters are the most appropriate parameters to determine the optimal dose for dapagliflozin. We therefore aimed to characterize the exposure–response relationship between dapagliflozin and a range of cardiorenal risk markers as well as adverse events, in order to evaluate the currently registered dosing regimen. 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS The 13 phase II/III trials of the dapagliflozin clinical development programme that formed the basis for the dose registration of dapagliflozin were included in this analysis, an overview of the included studies is depicted in Table  1 . All studies received approval of the final protocol by an independent ethics committee or institutional review board. Studies were performed in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and that are consistent with International Conference on Harmonization/Good Clinical Practice and applicable regulatory requirements and the AstraZeneca policy on bioethics.

However, the pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin have been quantified in a previous study by Van der Walt  et al . using a semimechanistic population pharmacokinetic model. 
 20 
  Child–Pugh score, ideal bodyweight, baseline creatinine clearance and age were identified in this model as covariates that explained variability in the pharmacokinetic profile between patients. These individual patient characteristics were available for all patients in our analysis; therefore, we used this pharmacokinetic model to predict the individual exposure to dapagliflozin. For each patient in our analysis, 1000 simulations including interindividual variability were performed. The median predicted area under the curve for 24 hour at steady state (AUC 0–24 ) for each individual was estimated. 2.2 Modelling of cardiorenal risk markers Population pharmacodynamic analyses explored the exposure–response relationship between dapagliflozin and various (cardiorenal) risk markers. Favourable effects have been demonstrated for serum creatinine (SCr), HCT, SBP, urinary albumin–creatinine ratio (UACR) and UA, and were therefore selected for the current analysis. In addition, FPG was used in the dose–response studies and therefore selected as glycaemic parameter in this study. For each trial, observations during the randomized period were included in the analysis. Observations after rescue medication were excluded from the analysis and, for the UACR dataset, only patients with microalbuminuria (UACR &gt;30 mg/g,  n  = 1859) at baseline were included. UACR observations were log‐transformed. For each of the analyses datasets, AUC 0–24  was assumed to be zero at baseline and, after baseline, the individual model predicted AUC 0–24  was incorporated in the datasets. A nonlinear mixed effects modelling approach was used to develop a population pharmacodynamic model for each (cardiorenal) risk marker. First‐order conditional estimation with interaction was used to obtain parameter estimates. An individual baseline parameter was estimated for each patient in the placebo‐group as a first step in the model development. Subsequently, several empirical structural models were evaluated in the placebo group to evaluate the effect of placebo administration and disease progression;Linear, power, exponential, Emax, Gompertz, Weibull, Bateman and cosine functions were evaluated both additive and proportional to the estimated baseline parameter. 
 21 
  Interindividual variability was formally tested on model parameters using a normal or log‐normal distribution. Also, covariance between model parameters was explored. After evaluating the placebo response, patients were stratified by treatment; dapagliflozin or placebo. The effect of treatment was then tested on the structural model parameters by estimating a drug effect per model parameter. The relationship between individual dapagliflozin exposure (AUC 0–24 ) and response was explored using linear, log‐linear or Emax functions. Additive, proportional and combined error models were evaluated to describe the residual variability. Finally, a covariate step was performed by plotting interindividual variability parameters  vs  covariates. When  R 
 2  &gt; .15 and  P  &lt; .05, covariate relationships were formally tested in the model. Covariates evaluated were: age, bodyweight, body mass index, compliance, duration of diabetes, ethnicity, FPG, haemoglobin, HbA1c, height, ideal bodyweight, liver function markers, SBP, SCr, race, region, sex, study identifier, UA. Model selection and evaluation was based on numerical and graphical evaluation as described by Byon  et al . 
 22 
 
 2.3 Modelling of adverse events Repeated time‐to‐event models were developed to investigate the exposure–response relationship between dapagliflozin and the probability of developing a genital tract infection (GTI) and urinary tract infection (UTI) in the 24 week study period. Studies MB102014, MB102067 and MB102080 were included in the repeated time‐to‐event analysis, since these datasets contained information about adverse events. Model parameters were obtained using the Laplacian estimation method. It was anticipated that the probability of developing an event was relatively low for both GTIs and UTIs. Therefore, at first, several structural models were evaluated to describe the hazard for each event of interest using the full datasets. Constant, Gompertz and Weibull functions were evaluated to describe the hazard. Second, the effect of dapagliflozin was explored using a similar approach as described above for the population pharmacodynamic models. The exposure–response relationship was evaluated using linear, log‐linear or Emax functions proportional to the hazard function. Model selection and evaluation was based on numerical diagnostics (i.e. the change in MOFV and reduction in relative standard error [RSE] of the population parameter estimates) and graphically using survival based visual predictive checks. Third, covariates were evaluated graphically by stratification of the survival based visual predictive checks. The covariate was formally tested if a discrepancy was discovered between observed  vs  predicted survival. 2.4 Exploring the exposure–response relationships Simulations with the final population pharmacodynamic models were performed to compare the exposure–response relationships between the cardiorenal risk markers. We evaluated the exposure–response relationship on week 24, as most of the clinical trials included in our analysis had a follow‐up of 24 weeks. For each model, 1000 patients were simulated per dapagliflozin dose group. Each simulation included interindividual random effects and assumed similar exposure and covariate distributions as observed in the population per dose group. For each cardiorenal risk marker, we estimated the maximum effect of dapagliflozin assuming an infinite high exposure (exposure of 1 000 000 ng h/mL). For both UTI and GTI, we estimated the probability of developing an event during 24 weeks. This probability was estimated by predicting the number of events in 24 weeks and dividing this number by the total number of subjects. 2.5 Software All data preparation and presentation was performed using R version 3.4.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). NONMEM version 7.3.0 (ICON Development Solutions, Ellicott City, MD, USA) was used for the pharmacokinetic simulations, development of population pharmacodynamic models and repeated time‐to‐event models and all simulations of the final models. 3 RESULTS 3.1 Demographics and estimation of exposure to dapagliflozin In total, 7005 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus randomized in 13 phase II/III randomized controlled trials of 12–24 week duration were included in the analysis. Baseline characteristics by treatment assignment are displayed in Table  2 . A dose range of 1.0–50.0 mg was evaluated, although a majority of patients received 5.0 mg (14.4%) or 10.0 mg (37.4%) dapagliflozin once daily. No apparent differences are visible between treatment groups in the patient characteristics, except for a difference in the duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus (Table  2 ). The individual median predicted dapagliflozin systemic exposure, stratified by treatment group, demonstrated that the exposure to dapagliflozin is dose proportional and the variability is such that dapagliflozin systemic exposure overlaps between the different treatment groups (Figure  1 ).

For all models, the individual baseline parameters were best described using a log‐normal distribution, except for HCT, which was best described using a normal distribution. A placebo response was identified for FPG and UACR, characterized by a proportional Weibull and power function, respectively. Drug effects could be identified for each pharmacodynamic parameter of interest, which could also be related to individual exposure. In general, Emax or log‐linear relationships were able to describe the exposure–response relationships. However, for HCT and SCr, drug effects were best described using a power‐ and a Bateman function, respectively. All goodness‐of‐fit plots demonstrate that the model predictions follow the central trend of the data, indicating appropriate structural models. No bias over time was observed in the conditional weighted residuals  vs  time plots. In general, model parameters were estimated with high precision (average RSE 11.6%, highest RSE was 60.9%, see Tables  S1–6 ). Interindividual variability was identified on the baseline parameters of all models. In addition, interindividual variability could be identified on other model parameters for SCr, FPG, HCT and UACR, but not for SBP and UA. Significant covariates that explained variability between patients in the different models were: age, bodyweight, duration of diabetes, serum creatinine, sex and UA (Table  3 ). Goodness‐of‐fit plots demonstrated that the individual model predictions followed the individual trend of the data. The residual error was estimated using either an additive, proportional or combined error model (Table  3 ). 3.3 Modelling of adverse events For modelling of adverse events, data were available for 2430 out of the 7005 patients included in our analysis from studies MB102014, MB102067 and MB102080. A total of 77 and 92 patients reported a GTI and UTI, respectively, during the study period of 24 weeks. Instead of time‐to‐event models that only include 1 observation per patient, we developed repeated time‐to‐event models that included all available observations. For GTI and UTI, a total of 87 and 108 events were observed during the clinical trials during the study period of 24 weeks. A brief description of the model development, model structure, model parameters and visual predictive checks stratified by treatment are displayed in Figures  S7 and 8, and Tables S7 and S8 . Table  3  provides an overview of the repeated time‐to‐event models for UTI and GTI. A Weibull model was used to describe the survival distribution over time for both GTI and UTI. Drug effects were identified for both GTI and UTI, which could also be related to individual exposure. For GTI, an Emax function was used to relate individual exposure to the probability of developing an event. For UTI, the individual dapagliflozin systemic exposure was log‐linearly related to the probability of developing an event. Significant covariates that explained differences in the probability of developing an event were sex and region for both GTI and UTI. In addition, for UTI, the use of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor was also a significant covariate. Both models were estimated with good precision (average RSE 32.7%, highest RSE was 72.42%, see Tables  S7 and S8 ). Furthermore, the goodness‐of‐fit plots indicate that the central trend of the data is adequately described by the model. 3.4 Exploration of the exposure–response relationships Figure  2  demonstrates the exposure–response relationship between dapagliflozin and each of the pharmacodynamic markers of interest at week 24. The individual exposure for 5 mg dapagliflozin was on average 327 ng h/mL (95% prediction interval [PI]: 187–547 ng h/mL), which translated in 55.9% (95% PI: 42.0–68.0%), 57.6% (95% PI: 54.6–60.3%) and 84.3% (95% PI: 75.5–90.0%) of its estimated maximum effect for FPG, HCT and SCr, respectively. Furthermore, 10 mg dapagliflozin resulted in an average individual exposure of 638 ng h/mL (95% PI: 354–1061 ng h/mL), which translated in 71.2% (95% PI: 57.9–80.5%), 61.1% (95% PI: 58.0–64.8%) and 91.3% (95% PI: 85.4–94.6%) of its estimated maximum effect for FPG, HCT and SCr, respectively. FIGURE 2 Exposure–response relationships at week 24 for fasting plasma glucose (top left), haematocrit (top right), serum creatinine (middle left), urinary albumin–creatinine ratio (middle right), uric acid (bottom left) and systolic blood pressure (bottom right). The line demonstrates the exposure–response relationship for the typical individual, individual points demonstrate the individual predictions. The 90% prediction interval has been included, if applicable, as interindividual random effects could only be identified on baseline and could not be identified in drug response for systolic blood pressure and uric acid. In each plot, the relationship between dose and median predicted AUC 0–24  is displayed for patients included in the pharmacodynamic datasets. Data were not available for dapagliflozin dose levels higher than 10 mg for both fasting plasma glucose and uric acid The effects of dapagliflozin on SBP, UA and UACR did not approach the maximum effect of dapagliflozin. For UACR, 10 mg dapagliflozin achieved 25.7% (95% PI: 23.5–28.3%) of the maximum effect. Moreover, for both SBP and UA, 10 mg dapagliflozin induced &lt;10% of the estimated maximum effect. The relationship between individual exposure to dapagliflozin and the probability of developing a GTI and UTI in 24 weeks is shown in Figure  3 . For GTI, the probability of developing an infection appeared to reach a maximum around an exposure of 500 ng h/mL, which is covered by the individual exposures following a dose of 5.0–10.0 mg dapagliflozin. For UTI, the maximum probability seems not to have been reached as the trend of developing an UTI is still increasing at a maximum exposure of 1000 ng h/mL. FIGURE 3 Exposure–response relationship for genital (left) and urinary tract infections (right). The figures demonstrate the exposure–response relationship for the typical individual and are stratified by sex and region of inclusion. Non‐European females (orange), non‐European males (yellow), European female (purple) and European male (red) 4 DISCUSSION In this pooled analysis, we quantified the exposure–response relationship between dapagliflozin and several (cardiorenal risk) markers and adverse events. Dapagliflozin given at 10 mg/d was close to its maximum effect for serum creatinine. For both FPG and HCT, 10 mg dapagliflozin resulted in effects that appeared to approach the maximum effect, although there was room for higher efficacy. For SBP, UA and UACR, the effects of dapagliflozin 10 mg/d reached &lt;25.7% of their maximum effects, suggesting that a higher dose of dapagliflozin could confer additional effect. From a safety perspective, the probability of developing a GTI reached a plateau around a dose of 5–10 mg. Since HCT, SBP and UACR are strong risk markers for renal and heart failure outcomes, our results suggest that a higher dose of dapagliflozin may confer additional clinical benefit in the long‐term. This exposure–response analysis contains 13 phase II and III trials of the clinical development programme of dapagliflozin that investigated efficacy and safety in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The included patient population of all studies demonstrated a broad range of patient characteristics, which were comparable amongst studies. Using a previously developed population pharmacokinetic model by van der Walt  et al., 
 
 20 
  we were able to predict the individual exposure for each patient included in our analysis. Model simulation techniques resulted in an average individual exposure of 638 ng h/mL and a 95% prediction interval ranging from 354 to 1061 ng h/mL following a 10 mg dapagliflozin dose at steady state. The prediction interval is comparable to previously reported interindividual variability at steady state for a 10 mg dose, 
 18 
  indicating the appropriateness of the model to predict individual exposures. In addition, a similar structural model was used in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus confirming the generalizability of the population pharmacokinetic model. 
 23 
 
 Favourable effects of dapagliflozin have been demonstrated on a range of cardiorenal risk markers including long‐term improvements in heart failure and kidney outcomes that are unlikely to be explained by improvements in glycaemic control. 
 13 
  In our analysis, and as expected, the dose–response relationship between dapagliflozin and FPG was in line with previous studies. 
 4 
  Interestingly, the exposure–response relationship for several other cardiorenal risk markers differed from FPG. As a consequence, for most cardiorenal risk markers, the maximal effects were not yet achieved at the registered antihyperglycaemic dose. This effect is reminiscent of angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin‐receptor blockers. Although these agents are registered as antihypertensive drugs, their benefits are likely mediated by their albuminuria lowering effect. 
 24 
  Dose‐finding studies have demonstrated that higher than maximum antihypertensive doses of these drugs result in additional albuminuria reduction and long‐term clinical benefits on kidney function.

  Collectively, these data complicate the optimal dose finding for a new drug, as the exposure–response relationship may be different among cardiorenal risk markers. Consequently, to determine the optimal dose of a new drug, the exposure–response relationships on a composite score including multiple pharmacodynamic efficacy and safety markers may be considered. 
 28 
 
 Establishing efficacy at higher doses should be weighed against the risk of developing more adverse events. We therefore characterized the relationship between exposure and adverse events with dapagliflozin. 
 13 
  For GTIs, the probability of developing an infection plateaued around a dose of 5–10 mg dapagliflozin. The probability of developing a UTI still increased at a dose of 10 mg dapagliflozin suggesting that based on our studies, higher efficacy may occur at the expense of more UTIs. We note, however, that the overall probability of developing an event was low for both GTIs and UTIs limiting the precision of the estimated probabilities. In addition, although earlier clinical trials, including those used for our study, reported differences in incidence of UTIs, the overall rate of these infections did not differ between SGLT2 and placebo treated patients in more recent cardiovascular outcome trials.

 The efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin as a treatment for chronic kidney disease is currently being investigated in patients with and without diabetes in the Study to Evaluate the Effect of Dapagliflozin on Renal Outcomes and Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease (Dapa‐CKD, NCT03036150). In addition, the Study to Evaluate the Effect of Dapagliflozin on the Incidence of Worsening Heart Failure or Cardiovascular Death in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure (Dapa‐HF, NCT03036124) demonstrated that dapagliflozin reduced the risk of heart failure or cardiovascular death compared to placebo regardless of the presence of diabetes mellitus type 2. 
 16 
  In these studies, patients without diabetes receive the highest approved antihyperglycaemic dapagliflozin dose of 10 mg/d. In patients without diabetes it is unlikely that dapagliflozin lowers Hba1c because of both decreased renal glucose filtration, reducing the drug's efficacy to inhibit tubular glucose reabsorption, and increasing hepatic glucose production that compensates for the increased urinary glucose loss.

  The optimal dose for nondiabetic patients should therefore be based on other cardiorenal risk markers. Our study offers a first assessment on the exposure–response relationship for dapagliflozin for other cardiorenal risk markers but future dedicated dose finding studies would be required to identify the optimal dose that reduces the risk for heart failure and kidney outcomes in the nondiabetic populations. This study has limitations including that in our analysis we were not able to identify interindividual variability in SBP and UA response. A possible explanation for this phenomenon, is that both markers already reached a maximum effect when the first observation after baseline had been collected. In that case, more densely sampled data in the first week after administration of dapagliflozin would be required to fully characterize the effects in these markers over time. Also, we acknowledge that only a limited number of patients were included in the analysis who received a dapagliflozin dose &gt;10 mg possibly limiting the precision of the estimated maximum effect. From the simulated exposures, it is, however, clear that there is large overlap in individual exposure between the different dose levels. In addition, we only included 6 cardiorenal markers and 2 types of adverse events. Therefore, we might have missed important cardiorenal risk markers or adverse events. Nonetheless, there was a clear difference between the exposure–response relationships, which could also be the case for other cardiorenal risk markers and adverse events. In the DECLARE‐TIMI 58 trial, an increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis and GTIs was observed in patients using dapagliflozin. 13  In the studies included in our analysis, there was only 1 event of diabetic ketoacidosis and therefore no model could be developed for this adverse event. Future research will be necessary to quantify the influence of dose on diabetic ketoacidosis. Furthermore, a lot of covariates were screened during the analysis; however, we cannot exclude that we missed important factors, such as smoking status, that could have affected the relationship between exposure and cardiorenal risk markers. Finally, in the exposure–response relationships for GTIs and UTIs, Europeans  vs  non‐Europeans appeared to be a significant covariate. There is no clear explanation for this finding and may be a chance finding due to the limited number of events. In conclusion, the exposure–response analysis demonstrates that the exposure–response relationship of dapagliflozin differs between various cardiorenal risk markers. A dapagliflozin dose &gt;10 mg could provide additional beneficial effects in FPG, HCT, SBP, albuminuria and UA. The exposure–response relationship between dapagliflozin and adverse events demonstrated that a higher dose could be safe, as the overall incidence of developing an event was low. Given that the investigated cardiorenal risk markers are strong risk markers for cardiovascular and renal outcomes raises the question whether clinical outcome trials specifically assessing the benefits of higher than currently registered doses of dapagliflozin are needed.

    <Body>What is Already Known about this Subject 
 Perampanel is an adjunctive treatment for partial‐onset, and primary generalized tonic–clonic seizures. 
 In vitro  work indicated a low potential for significant effects of perampanel on CYP or UGT enzymes. Perampanel has been reported to affect the exposure of some AEDs and non‐AEDs in a limited number of patients. Therefore, we report full PK models for the impact of perampanel on 11 concomitant AEDs in a Phase III study population. 
 What this Study Adds 
 Perampanel does not affect the clearance of most commonly used concomitant AEDs in a clinically relevant way, in patients with partial‐onset seizures. While perampanel is associated with a small reduction in oxcarbazepine clearance, the clinical relevance is not clear. 
 Introduction Perampanel is an antiepileptic drug (AED) approved for adjunctive treatment of partial‐onset and primary generalized tonic–clonic seizures in patients aged 12 and above  1 ,  2 . Phase III data in partial‐onset seizures  3 ,  4 ,  5  and primary generalized seizures  6  have been reported, and several pharmacokinetic (PK) and PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) analyses of healthy volunteer and patient populations have been reported  7 . 
 In vitro  data in hepatocytes shows that perampanel is metabolized predominantly by cytochrome P450 (CYP) isotype CYP3A4/5  7 , and therefore its clearance could be affected by AEDs (and other drugs) that inhibit or induce CYP3A4/5 – this has been extensively characterized and reported in PK analyses in epilepsy patient populations  1 ,  2 ,  8 ,  9 . When the effect of perampanel on other drugs was explored, perampanel was found to have only weak inhibitory effects  in vitro  on CYP (CYP2C8, CYP3A4) and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes (UGT1A9, UGT2B7), to weakly induce CYP2B6, CYP3A4/5, UGT1A1 and UGT1A4, and was not a substrate or inhibitor of drug transporters  in vitro 
 1 ,  2 ,  7 . Consequently, perampanel was not expected to cause a clinically important effect on the PK of other drugs. Contrary to these expectations, perampanel, at the highest approved clinical dose of 12 mg/day, reduces exposure of the progesterone component of the contraceptive pill. In a healthy volunteer study, 48 women took perampanel or placebo concomitantly for 21 days, with an oral combined contraceptive pill (Microgynon ® )  7 . Perampanel, at its highest recommended dose of 12 mg ( n  = 8), but not at doses of 8 or 4 mg/day, was shown to reduce mean  C 
 max  and AUC of levonorgestrel by 40%  vs . control, with minimal effects on the ethinylestradiol component (18% reduction in AUC)  7 . This effect has not been explored further in a wider clinical population, and the mechanism is as yet unknown. In light of this finding, it is important to confirm the expectation that perampanel has no perpetrator effects on other AEDs, and this was addressed via population‐based modelling of data obtained in three Phase III studies of perampanel in patients with refractory partial seizures. The impact of perampanel on the clearance of concomitant AEDs is briefly summarized in product labels  1 ,  2 , but the modelling process and results have not previously been reported in full. Here we report these data – the final models for each concomitant AED, and the impact on the clearance of each AED of adjunctive perampanel and demographics in the Phase III PK population of patients with refractory partial‐onset seizures. Methods Design The population was derived from three Phase III, multicentre, randomized, placebo‐controlled trials of adjunctive perampanel  3 ,  4 ,  5 . A 6‐week pre‐randomization phase was followed by a 19‐week double‐blind phase, which comprised a 6‐week titration phase and a 13‐week maintenance phase. Patients who completed the study then either had a follow‐up visit, or entered an open‐label extension study  10 ,  11 . Data for this analysis was obtained from the 13‐week maintenance phase. Participants The patient population is described in full elsewhere  3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  10 . Briefly, patients were aged ≥12 years, with partial‐onset seizures that were not controlled despite treatment with ≥2 AEDs in the past 2 years. Patients could receive up to three concomitant AEDs in addition to perampanel or placebo, providing doses were stable, and only one was an enzyme‐inducing AED (EIAED). When the studies began, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and primidone were defined as EIAEDs; however, subsequent analysis of the Phase III studies showed that perampanel clearance was in fact induced to a clinically relevant extent by carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine and phenytoin only  1 ,  12 . The AED PK population included all patients in the intent‐to‐treat (ITT) populations who had: at least one quantifiable AED plasma concentration data point at baseline and another during the maintenance phase; complete dosing and sampling history; adequate concomitant AED information; and no protocol deviation that might have affected exposure. Each of the Phase III clinical trials was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice ICH‐E6 Guideline CPMP/ICH/135/95, European Directive 2001/83/EC and US Code of Federal Regulations Title 21. Trial protocol, amendments and informed consent were reviewed by national regulatory authorities in each country and independent ethics committees or institutional review boards for each site. Before participation, all patients gave written informed consent  3 ,  4 ,  5 . Treatments The study drug (perampanel or matched placebo) was instructed to be dosed daily at bedtime. Information on concomitant AED dosing was recorded in the case report form. Inconsistencies were identified in some patients between recorded concomitant AED dosing and blood samples (e.g. missing or zero plasma concentrations for AEDs recorded as being taken concomitantly); subjects with inconsistent information were excluded from the AED population PK analyses. Analytical methods Two blood samples, taken 1–2 hours apart and approximately 10 hours and beyond after the evening dose of perampanel, were taken by venipuncture for assessment of perampanel concentration and of concomitant AED concentrations at visits 6, 7 and 8 (weeks 10, 14 and 19, during the maintenance phase). Additionally, single blood samples were taken for assessment of concomitant AED concentrations before the initiation of perampanel treatment at visit 1 (start of baseline) and visit 2 (start of titration, before the perampanel first dose); and also after early discontinuation or at study completion (follow‐up visit), if patients did not enter the extension study. The exact timing of PK sampling relative to dose of concomitant AEDs is not reported, as time‐variant models were not fitted to the data. The total plasma concentration of each of the 19 concomitant AEDs was determined using validated assay methods, utilizing liquid–liquid extraction followed by high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. All the bioanalytical assays were performed by Frontage Laboratories, Exton, Pennsylvania, USA. Accuracy and precision were within ±15% for low‐, mid‐ and high‐level concentrations except at the lower limit of quantitation, where ±20% was permitted based on laboratory standard operating procedures and FDA Guidance for Industry on Bioanalytical Methods Validation, May 2001. Assay interference was tested for all AEDs on perampanel and  vice versa , with no impact. For the data analysis, plasma concentrations were included only for the AEDs that were taken by at least 30 patients each: carbamazepine, clobazam, clonazepam, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, topiramate, valproic acid and zonisamide. Because the PK sampling was sparse, a sufficient number of subjects were required to adequately characterize the PK of each AED. A minimum of 30 subjects per AED was considered appropriate. Therefore, although plasma concentrations were measured for the following concomitant AEDs, they were not included in the data analysis because they were taken by fewer than 30 patients: acetazolamide, diazepam, felbamate, gabapentin, pregabalin, primidone, rufinamide and tiagabine. PK modelling PK model and parameters Due to the sparse nature of the data and having only two samples at each visit, 1–2 hours apart, and missing information on the dosing time of the concomitant AEDs, the estimation of complete compartmental PK modelling could not be utilized. Instead, a model estimating the apparent clearance as the ratio of the rate of input and the measured concentration was fitted to the data. The effect of perampanel and intrinsic and extrinsic covariates on the clearance of each AED was determined, and declared statistically significant if  P  &lt; 0.01 (a decrease in objective function of at least 6.64) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the effect parameter did not include unity. For all AEDs except phenytoin, a simple model was fitted to the data, assuming the observed concentration as a steady‐state concentration, close to the  C 
 avss  over a dosing interval, using the relationship:
 C avss = R 0 CL where  R 
 0  = total daily dose per 24 hours. For phenytoin, a Michaelis and Menten model using  V 
 max  (maximal velocity) and  K 
 m  (Michaelis constant) was fitted to the data. For each concomitant AED, the following covariates were investigated for their effect on apparent clearance: age, race, weight, fat body mass (FBM), lean body mass (LBM), body mass index (BMI), gender, concomitant medications, creatinine clearance and liver function enzymes (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST]). Variability in the apparent clearance ( CL / F ) between subjects was estimated using an exponential model. Inter‐occasion variability was defined for visits 1, 2, 6, 7 and 8 as five distinct but identical occasions. The variance of the residual error was estimated with either a combined proportional with additive error model or only proportional. The first‐order conditional estimation method with interaction (FOCEI) estimation method was used. Goodness of fit plots of the final model included: scatter plots of the population predictions (PRED)  vs . observations, on linear and log scales; scatter plots of the individual predictions (IPRED)  vs . observations, on linear and log scales; and scatter plots of the weighted residual (WRES)  vs . population predictions (PRED). The covariate selection was conducted as follows:
 A model including all demographic covariates of interest, AST, ALT and creatinine clearance was estimated, all redundant covariate parameters removed using backward deletion using the likelihood ratio test (LRT) at  P  &lt; 0.001. Then all potential AEDs (excluding perampanel) were added to the resulting model, and submitted to backward deletion until no redundant AED was present in the model. The final model from step 2 was used to investigate the effect of perampanel (yes/no), perampanel dose and concentrations on the clearance of the given AED. Linear, log‐linear and  E 
 max  (maximum effect on PD assessment) models were used to test the effect of perampanel. 
 Clinical relevance The clinical relevance of any effect of perampanel on AED clearance was determined by considering the magnitude of the effect on clearance in conjunction with the inter‐individual variability (IIV) in clearance. If the effect size was within the magnitude of IIV, the effect was considered not to be clinically relevant. The strength of any effect on clearance was also considered within the guidance from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on drug interactions. They classify ‘weak’ inhibitors as those that cause a 20–50% decrease in clearance or 1.25‐ to &lt;2‐fold increase in AUC, and ‘weak’ inducers as those that cause a 20–50% decrease in AUC  13 . PK model qualification The simulated and observed data were represented as a function of the time after dosing, rounded to the closest hour; i.e., data were summarized by bins of 1 hour. In addition, the observed data and 5th and 95th percentile limits were presented graphically overall, by dose and by visit. Results The PK population for concomitant AED analysis had broadly consistent demographics for each concomitant AED studied: carbamazepine, clobazam, clonazepam, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, topiramate, valproic acid and zonisamide (Table  1 ). As patients could take up to three concomitant AEDs, these groups are not mutually exclusive. Table 1 Demographics by concomitant AED in perampanel Phase III PK population

Observed AED plasma concentration by visit Box/whisker plots of observed plasma concentrations of each concomitant AED by visit (before and during perampanel treatment) are shown in Figure  1 . Little change is seen between median plasma concentration of any AED between the two pre‐perampanel measurements (visit 1 = baseline; visit 2 = first day of titration, before perampanel dosing) and during perampanel treatment (visits 6, 7 and 8 = weeks 10, 14 and 19 during the maintenance phase).

Visits are as follows: Baseline 1: Start of 6‐week baseline phase; Baseline 2: start of 6‐week titration phase, on the day that (but before) the first perampanel dose is administered; visit 6: week 10 (maintenance); visit 7: week 14 (maintenance); visit 8: week 19 (last week of maintenance phase). Plots are arranged alphabetically, from carbamazepine (A) to zonisamide (K) Model‐predicted clearance of concomitant AEDs The model‐predicted clearance of each concomitant AED, in the presence and absence of perampanel, is shown in Table  2 . The clearance of some concomitant AEDs was significantly affected by gender or by other concomitant AEDs (e.g. phenytoin); clearance is therefore shown separately for these subgroups where necessary. The impact of demographic covariates on AED clearance is shown in the Supplemental Material. Table 2 Impact of perampanel on model‐predicted clearance of concomitant AEDs in Phase III PK population

Clearance not significantly altered by perampanel Our modelling found no significant effect of perampanel on the clearance of the following AEDs, and the 95% CIs included unity: clonazepam (Figure  1 C), levetiracetam (Figure  1 E), phenobarbital (Figure  1 G), phenytoin (Figure  1 H), topiramate (Figure  1 I) and zonisamide (Figure  1 K). Full details of the final PK model for each concomitant AED are shown in Supplemental Tables S1 to S11. Apparent clearance of clonazepam, in the final model, was increased when co‐administered with phenytoin, valproic acid and clobazam (Supplemental Table S3); levetiracetam clearance increased with body weight, and was lower in female subjects and in subjects co‐administered phenytoin or valproic acid (Supplemental Table S5); phenobarbital clearance was greater in subjects with AST or ALT greater than two times the upper limit of normal, and lower in subjects co‐administered lamotrigine or oxcarbazepine (Supplemental Table S7); phenytoin clearance increased with an increase in its daily dose and was greater in subjects co‐administered oxcarbazepine or zonisamide (Supplemental Table S8); topiramate clearance increased with body weight and was greater in subjects co‐administered phenytoin or zonisamide (Supplemental Table S9); and zonisamide clearance increased in the presence of phenytoin and phenobarbital and was lower in subjects treated with clobazam (Supplemental Table S11). Clearance significantly altered by perampanel, but not clinically relevant Carbamazepine In the final model ( n  = 379 total,  n  = 269 with perampanel), carbamazepine dose and valproic acid co‐administration were significant covariates (Supplemental Table S1). In addition, perampanel co‐administration increased carbamazepine clearance, proportional to perampanel dose and to carbamazepine clearance (final dose effect of perampanel: 0.00357, 95% CI 0.0001–0.0071; Supplemental Table S1). However, model‐derived predictions of the effects of perampanel on carbamazepine clearance (3.5 l h −1  without perampanel, 3.60–3.65 l h −1  with perampanel; Table  2 ) indicated the magnitude of the perampanel effect is very small (clearance increased by 4.3% with 12 mg perampanel). The magnitude of this effect is very small and within the inter‐subject variability – the effect is therefore not considered clinically relevant. Clobazam The model showed that perampanel was associated with an increase in clobazam clearance, proportional to perampanel concentrations and to clobazam clearance (final concentration‐effect of perampanel 0.0000678, 95% CI 0.0000249–0.0001107; Supplemental Table S2). Model‐derived predictions of the effects of perampanel on clobazam clearance show that in males, predicted clobazam clearance without perampanel is 3.27 l h −1 , and with perampanel ranges from 3.36 to 3.38 l h −1  (3.4% increase with 12 mg, Table  2 ). In females, predicted clearance without perampanel is 1.43 l h −1  and with perampanel ranges from 1.52 to 1.54 l h −1  (7.7% increase with 12 mg, Table  2 ). The small magnitude of the increase in clearance, along with the lack of change in IIV between the base and the final model for clobazam, suggest that perampanel had no clinically important effect on clobazam PK. Lamotrigine In the final model, lamotrigine apparent clearance was increased by co‐administration with carbamazepine and phenobarbital and decreased in subjects treated with valproic acid. In addition, perampanel increased lamotrigine clearance proportionally to the log e  of perampanel daily dose (final estimate: 0.037; 95% CI 0.018–0.056; Supplemental Table S4). The model predicts a slight increase of lamotrigine clearance from 1.18 l h −1  without perampanel, to 1.27–1.29 l h −1  in the presence of perampanel (9.3% increase with 12 mg, Table  2 ). This effect was not considered clinically relevant. Valproate In the final PK model, valproic acid clearance increased with body weight and increased proportionally to perampanel dose (effect of perampanel dose: 0.00761, 95% CI 0.002–0.014; Supplemental Table S10). Model‐derived predictions give valproic acid clearance of 0.60 l h −1  without perampanel, and 0.62–0.63 with (5.0% increase with 12 mg, Table  2 ). The effect was not considered clinically relevant. Clearance altered by perampanel, potentially clinically relevant Oxcarbazepine Observed plasma concentrations of oxcarbazepine before and during perampanel treatment are shown in Figure  1 F. In the final model for oxcarbazepine, clearance was lower in females than males and increased when co‐administered with phenytoin. Perampanel co‐administration resulted in a 26% decrease in oxcarbazepine clearance, independent of perampanel dose or concentration (perampanel effect −0.261; 95% CI −0.392–−0.13; Supplemental Table S6). Model‐derived predictions of the effects of perampanel on oxcarbazepine clearance are shown in Table  2 . The relevance of such changes is unknown since oxcarbazepine acts as a pro‐drug to its major metabolite MHD, which has a different pharmacokinetic profile and was not measured in this study. However, the magnitude of the effect of perampanel dosing on oxcarbazepine clearance remains within both the estimated IIV of 55% and IOV of 41%. Metabolic pathways A summary of the metabolic pathways of each concomitant AED, and the effect of perampanel on its clearance, is shown in Table  3 .

Discussion Pre‐clinical pharmacokinetic studies with perampanel indicated a low likelihood of clinically relevant perpetrator effects on other drugs: it was not a substrate or an inhibitor of drug transporters, and had only weak inducing (CYP2B6, CYP3A4, UGT1A1, UGT1A4) and inhibitory (CYP2C8, CYP3A4, UGT1A9, UGT2B7) effects on metabolic enzymes in liver microsomes  in vitro  (Table  4 )  1 ,  2 ,  7 . The results from our clinical analyses in patients taking adjunctive perampanel for partial‐onset seizures broadly support this pre‐clinical profile.

 2 ,  7 . No strong inducing or inhibiting effects were seen. No significant effects of perampanel on the clearance of clonazepam, levetiracetam, phenobarbital, phenytoin, topiramate and zonisamide were found. Statistically significant, but very weak, effects of perampanel were detected on the clearance of carbamazepine (increased by 4.3%), clobazam (+3.4% in males, +7.7% in females), lamotrigine (+9.3%), and valproic acid (+5.0%), none of which were considered clinically relevant. Indeed, the statistically significant findings may reflect the power of population modelling to detect drug–drug interactions rather than signifying clinically relevant interactions. The technique has extremely high power to detect very small differences. For oxcarbazepine, our model predicted a 26% decrease in oxcarbazepine clearance in patients taking adjunctive perampanel (compared with placebo), but the clinical relevance of this is unknown, as levels of the active metabolite of oxcarbazepine (MHD) were not measured. Based on the official FDA categorization of drug interactions, the effects of perampanel on clearance of carbamazepine, clobazam, lamotrigine, valproic acid do not even reach ‘weak’ induction, and the effect on oxcarbazepine is at the bottom of the ‘weak inhibitor’ range  13 . The mechanism of any interaction with oxcarbazepine is unknown, and cannot be explained by any known effects on metabolic enzymes. Perampanel is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 enzymes, whereas oxcarbazepine is metabolized to the active monohydroxy metabolite MHD by cytosolic enzymes (Table  3 ). This requires further investigation. Perampanel,  in vitro , was found to be a weak inducer of CYP3A4/5 in liver microsomes (Table  4 ); therefore, a healthy volunteer study with midazolam was undertaken (midazolam is the recommended probe to explore CYP3A interactions). In that study, statistically significant but small reductions on midazolam  C 
 max  (15%) and AUC (13%) were observed.  7 . Somewhat consistent with this, we saw a small (&lt;5%) increase in clearance of some AEDs that are primarily CYP3A4 substrates (carbamazepine, clobazam) and also of valproate (for which CYP3A4 is not the primary route)  14 ,  15 ; however, we found no effect of perampanel on the clearance of clonazepam and zonisamde, which are also CYP3A4 substrates. These small magnitude effects, and lack of consistency relative to CYP/UGT subtypes, seem to suggest random effects that are reflective of variations in clearance rather than any consistent inducing or inhibiting effect of perampanel on CYP or UGT enzymes. Our analyses here, along with the PK data from clinical trials, healthy volunteer studies and  in vitro  data from preclinical studies with perampanel indicated no consistent or clinically relevant effects on other AEDs. However, there is some evidence that perampanel can affect the exposure of some drugs, in some patients, but through so far unknown mechanism(s). Perampanel, at a dose of 12 mg/day, has been shown to reduce AUC of levonorgestrel by 40% in a healthy volunteer study in 48 women  1 ,  2 ,  7 , which cannot be accounted for by any known effects of perampanel on CYP or UGT enzymes, or drug transporters. In addition, a recent publication reported two cases where the addition of perampanel to AED regimens coincided with a large reduction in blood levels of phenytoin in one patient and of rufinamide in another patient, with the development of convulsive status epilepticus  16 . From our analysis in 90 patients taking phenytoin (68 with concomitant perampanel; 22 with placebo), we saw no evidence that perampanel affected phenytoin clearance, but there were insufficient patients taking rufinamide in the perampanel Phase III studies to determine its impact on rufinamide clearance. Theoretically, there is no basis for expecting an interaction with either AED, as perampanel had no known inhibitory or inducing effects on CYP2C9 or CYP2C19, the major enzymes responsible for phenytoin metabolism, or any known strong effects on hydrolysis or UGT enzymes, the main routes of rufinamide metabolism  14 . Known induction or inhibitory effects of perampanel therefore cannot account for these two cases. The only additional route of metabolism that has been explored with perampanel does not help to explain the levonorgestrel result or the two cases above. During its clinical development, perampanel was shown to have no effect on the PK of levodopa (when given in combination with carbidopa as Sinemet ® , to healthy volunteers), suggesting no interference with decarboxylation or carbidopa's inhibition of decarboxylation  7 . Our report is limited by several factors inherent to using clinical trial data to explore drug interactions. The population reflects the required, and often narrow, eligibility criteria of the clinical trial, so populations of particular interest – e.g. elderly patients and those with multiple concomitant medications – are not well represented in our dataset. Although the PK population was large, only small numbers of patients were taking some of the concomitant AEDs that are now of interest (e.g. rufinamide, in light of the case report by Novy  et al .  16 ) or newer AEDs that were not frequently used at the time of the clinical trials. The genetic diversity in metabolic enzyme function is likely to be an important contributor to the inter‐individual variability in clearance that we saw, but the patient population was not genotyped so this avenue cannot be explored further. It is theoretically possible that, by including only patients who had two quantifiable plasma samples and no changes in concomitant AEDs, our analysis excluded patients who dropped out or adjusted AED dosages because of adverse events caused by perampanel affecting the plasma levels of concomitant AEDs. However, any such patients would have been included in the pooled Phase III analyses, where no patterns in side effects or AE‐related discontinuation were evident for any individual concomitant AED. Overall, 9.5% of the Phase III population had AEs that necessitated discontinuation from the study  17 . In conclusion,  in vitro  studies predicted a low potential for perampanel to interact with other drugs, and our population PK analysis of perampanel with concomitant AEDs is broadly in line with this prediction. Perampanel had a small statistically significant effect on the clearance of several concomitant AEDs, but no consistent or clinically notable effect that implicates one particular interaction mechanism for this AED, in our clinical trial population of patients with refractory partial‐onset seizures. However, potential interactions via unknown mechanisms cannot be excluded, and it will be valuable to collect information on potential interactions with perampanel in clinical use.

    <Title>Postvaccination anaphylaxis and mRNA‐based SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccines—Much ado about nothing?</Title>
    <Doi>10.1111/bcp.14763</Doi>
    <Authors>Marcec Robert, Likic Robert</Authors>
    <Abstact/>
    <Body>On December 2, 2020, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has given approval to the mRNA SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech for use in the United Kingdom, making it both the first SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccine as well as mRNA drug in general to be licensed for widespread use in the western world. The initial enthusiasm regarding the first COVID‐19 vaccine unfortunately quickly declined, following 2 instances of postvaccination anaphylaxis being reported on the first day of widespread vaccination. Within 24 h, the MHRA issued a new guidance, in which it stated that individuals with a history of anaphylaxis to food, medicines, or vaccines should not receive the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. The news regarding the adverse events following vaccinations quickly filled the headlines of media around the world; however, after more than 1 month of vaccination in the United Kingdom and elsewhere and an analysis of anaphylaxis reports, the MHRA updated their guidance again by stating that only individuals with a known history of allergy to an ingredient of the vaccine should not receive it. 
 1 
 
 Phase 3 trial results of the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine have been published in the  New England Journal of  Medicine. 
 2 
  Of the 43 448 trial participants, half received the BNT162b2 vaccine and half placebo and all were subsequently monitored for a median of 2 months. The trial results showed that the vaccine is 95% effective in preventing COVID‐19 (95% credible interval, 90.3–97.6). When looking at the safety profile of the vaccine, adverse events were more common in the vaccine group (27% vs. placebo 12%) due to the inclusion of transient reactogenicity events, while the incidence of serious adverse events was similar in both groups, 0.6% in those vaccinated vs. 0.5% in the placebo group. 
 2 
 
 As Stone et al. point out in their systematic literature review of immune‐mediated vaccine adverse events published recently in the  British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology  ( BJCP ), severe adverse events are rare, but they possess the potential to spark doubt in the safety of vaccines and to increase vaccine hesitancy. 
 3 
  Local reactogenic reactions to vaccines such as prolonged warmth, redness, swelling, rash, or malaise are the most common type of immune‐mediated adverse reactions after vaccination and are transient and harmless in nature. In contrast, reactions which can be classified as anaphylaxis or IgE‐mediated reactions occur in less than 1 case per million doses administered and are most commonly caused by a preexisting allergy to an administered vaccine excipient. 
 3 
 
 The exact anaphylaxis trigger in the BNT162b2 vaccine has yet to be identified, but looking at the list of ingredients of the vaccine, a possible culprit could be a polyethylene glycol compound: 2[(polyethylene glycol)‐2000]‐ N , N ‐ditetradecylacetamide. 
 4 
  Polyethylene glycols (PEG) are widely used in household items, food, and medicines and are considered safe; however, rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. A literature review on immediate type hypersensitivity to PEG published in the  Clinical and Experimental Allergy  journal in 2016 identified 37 reports of hypersensitivity reactions caused by PEG that were described between January 1977 and April 2016, out of which 76% ( n  = 28/37) fulfilled criteria for anaphylaxis. 
 5 
  The exact mechanism of PEGs' hypersensitivity remains elusive, but based on the results of basophile activation and histamine release tests, it is believed to be IgE mediated. Although it seems that hypersensitivity to PEG is rare, the possibility that it remains underrecognized and therefore underreported should be considered. 
 5 
 
 The American Centre for Disease Control (CDC) reported the incidence of anaphylaxis following the first dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to be 11.1 cases per million doses administered. It seems that postvaccination anaphylaxis is 10 times more common following the administration of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine than other vaccines, but it is still regarded as a rare occurrence and the CDC warns that the incidence may be overestimated as it is possible that anaphylaxis cases are reported faster than the exact number of vaccine doses administered. 
 6 
  Furthermore, Moderna's mRNA SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccine has been approved for use in the United Kingdom on January 8, 2021, and it also contains a similar PEG ingredient: polyethylene glycol 2000 dimyristoyl glycerol. Cases of postvaccination anaphylaxis with the Moderna vaccine have been reported as well, but it seems that the incidence is lower than that of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, amounting to 2.5 cases per million Moderna doses administered, according to the CDC. 
 7 
 
 As it was pointed out by Polack and al., the Phase 3 BNT162b2 vaccine trial was large enough to detect with 83% probability at least one adverse event with an incidence of 0.01%, but for the detection of rarer adverse events (like anaphylaxis), it lacked sample size, as well as follow up duration. 
 2 
  Such phase 3 trial limitations in general underline the importance of phase 4 trials or post‐marketing surveillance, in which the true safety profile of any drug (vaccines included) is determined. As the number of individuals receiving the vaccine increases, so too will the number of reported rare adverse events that were not detected by the phase 3 trials. Although these events are rare, they must be evaluated and properly investigated on a case‐by‐case basis in order to determine potential causality. The public should be aware of the process and scrutiny with which all safety concerns are evaluated, and that this is a normal ongoing process throughout the whole life cycle of every drug and vaccine. 
 8 
 
 An example of such post‐marketing safety surveillance regarding human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines has recently been published in the  BJCP  by Bolando et al., where the authors analysed data regarding adverse events following HPV vaccination from 55 356 reports to the US Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System in a 10‐year period, between 2007 and 2017, and compared them to 224 863 corresponding vaccine‐event pairs. 
 9 
  The most common and statistically significant events were dizziness ( n  = 6259; ROR = 2.60) and syncope ( n  = 6004; ROR = 6.28), but some new potential safety signals like alopecia ( n  = 491, ROR = 10.39), hyperacusis ( n  = 185, ROR = 7.13), and parosmia ( n  = 37, ROR = 4.77) were also identified and further investigated. All in all, the benefits of HPV vaccination heavily outweighed the associated risks, and the majority of reports were of non‐serious nature and were already listed in the corresponding summary of the product characteristics. 
 9 
  Pharmacovigilance studies similar to that of Bolando et al. regarding SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccines will surely be published in the future. As significant number of potential vaccines are still in phase 3 trials, it will certainly be interesting to compare efficacy and safety data on the different types of COVID‐19 vaccines that eventually get licensed. COVID‐19 vaccination in the United Kingdom is currently in the centre of global public attention and the way adverse events are reported could have negative, as well as positive impacts on vaccine hesitancy. Cohen et al. stressed the importance of transparency and proper information regarding COVID‐19 vaccines. 
 10 
  All information regarding vaccine development, trials, and authorization should be made available to the public and adverse events should be clearly reported, along with all the necessary information about the possible risks those events pose to individuals in the context of benefits of vaccination for the society. This should serve to increase the trust towards vaccination. 
 10 
  The public must also become more aware that although every drug, intervention, or vaccine has potential side effects, the risks are largely outweighed by the benefits and rare adverse events should not be overemphasized. COMPETING INTERESTS There are no competing interests to declare.

    <Body>What is already known about this subject 
 Navoximod (also known as GDC‐0919 and NLG‐919) is a potent and selective small‐molecule inhibitor of IDO1 for treatment of local and peripheral immune tolerance that might arise in association with cancer. 
 What this study adds 
 The study provided definitive information regarding the absolute bioavailability and the metabolism, elimination and clearance pathways of navoximod. Identification of glucuronidation as the major metabolic pathway of navoximod and M28 as the major circulating metabolite. 
 1 INTRODUCTION 
 Indoleamine‐2,3‐dioxygenase 1  (IDO1, EC 1.13.11.52) is a cytosolic enzyme that catalyses the oxidation of the essential amino acid, L‐tryptophan, into kynurenine. 1  The IDO1 pathway plays an important role in the local control of inflammation and acquired immune peripheral tolerance. 1 ,  2 ,  3  IDO1 is expressed in tumour and host immune cells in patients with various tumour types and its expression level is associated with significantly worse clinical outcomes. 4 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7 ,  8  Given the important role of IDO1 in immune tolerance and overexpression in many human cancers, it is a prime target for cancer immunotherapy. Navoximod (also known as GDC‐0919 and NLG‐919) is a potent and selective small‐molecule inhibitor of IDO1 and an investigational drug candidate for the treatment of local and peripheral immune tolerance that might arise in association with cancer. Nonclinical pharmacology studies indicated that navoximod inhibits IDO1 with a potency of 75–90 nM in cell‐based assays. 9  In preclinical models, navoximod in combination with anti‐PD‐L1 (programmed death‐ligand 1), enhances the activity of intratumoral CD8+ T cells and inhibits tumour growth compared to either treatment alone. 10 
 Clinically, navoximod has favourable safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profiles when given as a monotherapy or in combination with atezolizumab, a PD‐L1 inhibitor. 11 ,  12  Navoximod is rapidly absorbed and demonstrates linear pharmacokinetics with dose‐proportional increases in exposure over the dose range of 50–1000 mg. Navoximod has a half‐life of approximately 12 hours, supporting a twice daily (BID) dosing regimen. The mean accumulation index of navoximod is approximately 1.7, which is consistent with the half‐life and BID dosing regimen. The objectives of the current study were to determine the absolute bioavailability, characterize the pharmacokinetics of navoximod following oral and IV administration, determine the mass balance and routes of excretion of navoximod, and characterize the metabolites of navoximod in plasma, urine and faeces. Overall, the data from this study provided a comprehensive understanding of the disposition of navoximod in humans, which was applied to interpret its oral bioavailability and total metabolism. 2 METHODS 2.1 Study design This was a Phase 1, single‐centre, open‐label, two‐part absolute bioavailability (aBA) and absorption, metabolism and excretion (AME) study, conducted at the Covance Clinical Research Unit (CRU) in Madison, Wisconsin. Part 1 was a randomized, two treatment cross‐over study to determine the aBA of navoximod following separate oral administration of navoximod (one 200 mg tablet) and a single intravenous (IV) dose of navoximod (5 mg solution, pushed over 3–5 minutes) under fasted conditions, to 16 healthy volunteers. Each study participant received both treatments separated by 5 days and the order of treatment was determined by randomization. Subjects participating in Part 1 were confined continuously at the CRU from time of check‐in (Day −1) until clinic discharge (Day 11). Part 2 was a single‐arm AME study to investigate the mass balance of [ 14 C]‐navoximod administered as a single 200 mg/600 μCi oral dose. Subjects ( n  = 8) participating in Part 2 were confined continuously at the CRU from the time of check‐in (Day −1) until clinic discharge, for a minimum stay of 5 days post‐dose (Day 6) and a maximum confinement of 14 days post‐dose (Day 15). Clinic discharge was based on subjects meeting the discharge criteria that blood and plasma radioactivity levels were below the limit of quantitation for two consecutive samples and ≥90% of the dose had been recovered; or total radioactivity in excreta reached ≤1% of the administered dose for two consecutive collections. 2.2 Subjects Healthy volunteers that were eligible for inclusion in this study were males (Parts 1 and 2) or females (Part 1 only) between 18 and 55 years of age, with a body mass index of 18.5–32 kg/m 2 . Subjects were in good health, as determined from a medical history, vital signs, 12‐lead electrocardiogram and clinical laboratory evaluations. Female subjects of child‐bearing potential were not pregnant or lactating and were willing to use non‐hormonal contraceptive methods from the time of signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF) or 10 days prior to check‐in (Day −1) until at least 28 days after the last study drug administration. Participants were excluded if any of the following criteria were applicable: significant history or clinical manifestation of any metabolic, allergic, dermatological, hepatic, renal, haematological, pulmonary, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and/or neurological/psychiatric disorder; history of autoimmune disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonitis, food/drug hypersensitivity, stomach/intestinal surgery that would alter drug absorption, alcoholism/drug addiction and/or tuberculosis; prior allogeneic bone marrow or solid organ transplantation; major surgical procedure within 28 days; severe infection within 4 weeks; prior exposure to immune‐modulating oncology therapeutics; use of prescription medications/products within 14 days; use of non‐prescription medications/products within 7 days; participation in a previous radiolabel study within 12 months (Part 2 only); exposure to significant radiation within 12 months (Part 2 only). The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. All participants provided written informed consent prior to any study‐related procedures. The clinical study protocol, informed consent forms, and any information given to the subjects and relevant supporting information were submitted for review and approval by the institutional review board (IRB) of Covance prior to study screening. 2.3 Dose rationale Single and twice daily oral doses (up to the maximum assessed dose of 1000 mg) of navoximod monotherapy are well tolerated in clinical studies in cancer patients; 11 ,  12  therefore, a single 200 mg oral dose was considered suitable for this study. A 5 mg intravenous (IV) dose was selected based on pharmacokinetic simulations, with a predicted  C 
 max  below the median  C 
 max  of a 200 mg oral dose (assuming a conservative absolute bioavailability of 0.5). Given the short half‐life of navoximod (~12 hours), a radioactivity dose of 600 μCi for the AME portion of this study was selected to ensure there was sufficient radioactivity in circulation for metabolite profiling using conventional radio‐detection methods. The radiation burden of a single 600 μCi oral dose of  14 C‐navoximod was estimated to be 0.56% of the 3000–5000 mrem limits specified by the United States Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) based on dosimetry calculations from tissue distribution data obtained in rats. 2.4 Safety assessments In Parts 1 and 2, safety assessments (physical examinations, 12‐lead electrocardiograms [ECGs], vital signs, How Do You Feel? [HDYF?] inquiries, and clinical laboratory evaluations) were performed at screening, during the study and/or at study completion/clinic discharge/early termination (ET). All adverse events (AEs), whether volunteered, elicited or noted on physical examination, were recorded throughout the study. 2.5 Materials Navoximod was prepared by Wuxi AppTec Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China) and the film‐coated 200 mg navoximod tablet was prepared by Hoffman‐LaRoche (Basel, Switzerland). [ 14 C]‐navoximod (specific activity 10.6 mCi/mmol) was synthesized by Selcia (Essex, UK). 2.6 Radiolabelled and IV dose preparation The IV drug product was an aqueous solution containing 5 mg of navoximod in 5 mL of normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride in water for injection). The oral aqueous solution contained 200 mg of [ 14 C]‐navoximod (22.2 MBq; 600 μCi) mixed in 20 mL water. The solubility of navoximod in water and other physiological relevant media is 200 mg/mL. Prior formulation studies determined that the IV and oral solution formulations were appropriate to obtain the target drug concentrations using high‐performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. In addition, the IV and oral solution appearances were clear and colourless prior to dosing. 2.7 Sample collection In Part 1 of the study, blood samples for plasma concentrations of navoximod were collected from subjects at pre‐dose, end of IV push (IV dose only), 0.083 (IV dose only), 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 72 h post‐dose. In Part 2 of the study, blood samples for plasma concentrations of navoximod and total radioactivity in the plasma and blood were collected at pre‐dose and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72 and 96 h post‐dose, and continued until the radioactivity counts were below the detection limit or a maximum confinement of 15 days was reached. Urine was collected pre‐dose and at 0–4 h, 4–8 h, 8–12 h and 12 to 24 h collection intervals; and then at 24 h intervals until the subject was discharged from the clinical site. Faecal samples were collected pre‐dose and at 24 h intervals until the subject was discharged from the clinical site. 2.8 Analytical methods 2.8.1 Bioanalysis of unlabelled navoximod in plasma Plasma concentrations of navoximod were determined using one of two validated liquid chromatographic‐tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) methods with a detection range of 0.05–50 ng/mL or 1–1000 ng/mL for low and high concentration samples, respectively. In both assays, samples were processed using protein precipitation extraction procedures and [ 13 C,  15 N 2 ]‐navoximod was used as the internal standard. Chromatography of navoximod was achieved with an Atlantis T3 (5 μm, 50 × 4.6 mm, Waters Corporation, Milford, MA) column. The mobile phase A was 1 mM ammonium acetate in acetonitrile:water:formic acid (5:95:0.025) and the mobile phase B was 1 mM ammonium acetate in acetonitrile:water:formic acid (95:4.975:0.025). The gradient was 10% B for the first 0.4 minutes, linearly increased to 25% B between 0.4 and 2.0 minutes, further increased to 90% B between 2.0 and 2.3 minutes, maintained at 90% B between 2.3 to 3.2 minutes, decreased to 10% B between 3.2 and 3.4 minutes, and maintained at 10% B between 3.4 and 4.0 minutes. The flow rate was 1.8 mL/min and the cycle time was approximately 4.7 minutes. A Sciex API 4000 (detection range: 1–1000 ng/mL) or Sciex 5500 (detection range: 0.05–50 ng/mL) with an electrospray source in the positive ion multiple‐reaction monitoring (MRM) mode was used for detection of navoximod in plasma samples. The MRM transition for navoximod and the internal standard, [ 13 C,  15 N 2 ]‐navoximod, was m/z 317.3 → 189.2 and m/z 320.2 → 192.1, respectively. The intra‐run and inter‐run precision of both assays was within 7.2% and accuracy was within ±12.2% of the nominal concentration values. Navoximod was found to be stable in human plasma over five freeze–thaw cycles, at least for 110 days at −10°C to −30°C and −60°C to −80°C, and for 24 h at room temperature. 2.8.2 Determination of radioactivity Blood and faecal homogenates were combusted using a Model 307 Sample Oxidizer (Packard Instrument Company, Meriden, CT) and the resulting  14 CO 2  was trapped in Carbo‐Sorb and mixed with Perma Fluor. Oxidation efficiency was evaluated on each day of sample combustion by analysing a commercial radiolabelled standard both directly in scintillation cocktail and by oxidation. Acceptance criteria were combustion recoveries of 95 to 105%. Ultima Gold XR scintillation cocktail was used for samples analysed directly. All samples were analysed for radioactivity in Model 2900TR or 2910TR liquid scintillation counters (Packard Instrument Company) for at least 5 minutes or 100 000 counts. The LLOQ for radioactivity analysis by liquid scintillation counting is defined as three‐fold above blank matrix counts. Scintillation counting data (dpm) were automatically corrected for background counts. Each sample was homogenized or mixed before radioanalysis (unless the entire sample was used for analysis) and analysed in duplicate. 2.9 Metabolite profiling and identification 2.9.1 Sample preparation and chromatographic separations Plasma radioprofiles were collected at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144 and 168–336 h post‐dose as pooled samples across the eight subjects to obtain the pharmacokinetics of the abundant metabolites. Plasma samples were also pooled across 0–48 h based on AUC for individual subjects to assess inter‐subject variability. Pooled plasma samples were extracted twice with three volumes of acetonitrile (ACN). The extracts from each step were combined and concentrated under vacuum, then re‐dissolved with water: ACN (2:1, v:v) for radiometric analysis. The pooled urine (0–48 h) represented &gt;90% of the total radioactivity excreted in urine and was directly injected for LC–MS radioprofile analysis following centrifugation. The pooled faecal homogenates (0–96 or 0–120 h) also represented &gt;90% of the total radioactivity excreted in the faeces. Faecal homogenates were extracted twice with three volumes of ACN. The supernatants were combined and evaporated to dryness under vacuum and the residues were reconstituted with water: ACN (2:1, v:v) for LC–MS radioprofiling. Chromatographic separations were performed using an UltiMate 3000 UPLC system (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) using a Kinetex EVO C18 column (5 μm, 4.6 × 50 mm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) and mobile phases A (10 mM ammonium acetate in H 2 O, adjust to pH 5) and B (10 mM ammonium acetate in MeOH/H 2 O [ v /v, 90/10]). Gradient was 5% B for 2 minutes, increased to 10% B over 2 minutes, increased to 30% over 29 minutes, increased to 45% B over 13 minutes, increased to 65% over 3 minutes, rapidly to 95% in 0.5 minutes. The column was flushed at 95% B for 5 minutes, then returned to 5% B over 0.5 minutes and re‐equilibrated to these conditions for 5 minutes. The total run time was 60 minutes. For radioprofiling, the column flow was split 3:1 with the minor component directed to the mass spectrometer and the major component directed to a fraction collector for collection to DeepWell LumaPlate 96 well plates (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) based on time (0.22 min/fraction). Following fraction collection, the plates were dried under vacuum. The radioactivity in each fraction was measured using a MicroBeta Scintillation and Luminescence Counter (Perkin Elmer, Shelton, CT) for 5 minutes. Radiochromatograms were reconstructed using Laura Evaluation software (LabLogic, Brandon, FL) and the radiopeaks were integrated to determine the percent distribution of radioactivity in each sample. 2.9.2 Metabolite structure identification Mass spectra were obtained with an LTQ Orbitrap Fusion Lumos high‐resolution mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source from Thermo Scientific (San Jose, CA). The electrospray ion source voltage was 3.5 kV. The heated capillary temperature was 300°C and vaporizer temperature was 250°C. The scan‐event cycle consisted of a full‐scan mass spectrum at a mass resolving power of 120 000 (at  m/z  400) and the corresponding data‐dependent MS/MS and MS 3  CID and HCD were acquired at a resolving power of 15 000. Accurate mass measurements were performed using internal calibration using fluoranthene (M +  = 202.0777). 2.10 Pharmacokinetic analyses Mean plasma concentration–time profiles and total radioactivity for plasma, whole blood, urine and faeces data were plotted using GraphPad Prism Version 7.04. PK parameters for unlabelled navoximod in plasma, and total radioactivity in plasma and whole blood were determined by standard non‐compartmental methods, using Phoenix WinNonlin v. 6.4 (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA). Samples below the LLOQ were set to zero for all analyses unless they occurred between two quantifiable concentrations in a profile, in which case they were set to missing. The following PK parameters were calculated for navoximod and total radioactivity in plasma and whole blood: maximum observed concentration ( C 
 max ), area under the concentration–time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0‐∞ ), area under the concentration–time curve from time 0 to the last measurable concentration (AUC 0–last ), time to maximum observed concentration ( t 
 max ), apparent elimination half‐life ( t 
 1/2 ) calculated as 0.693/λ z , absolute bioavailability (F) of navoximod using the ratio of dose‐normalized oral AUC 0‐∞  to dose normalized IV AUC 0‐∞ , systemic clearance of navoximod following IV administration (CL), and apparent oral clearance of navoximod (CL/F), volume of distribution of navoximod following IV administration (V z ) and apparent volume of distribution of navoximod (V/F). 2.11 Statistics The sample size of Part 1 (aBA) was selected to minimize exposure of navoximod to healthy volunteers, but was adequate to characterize the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of navoximod (not based on formal sample size calculations). For Part 2 (hAME), the sample size was based on practical considerations needed to meet the objectives of an ADME study, 13  and was not powered on the basis of statistical hypothesis testing. No formal statistical analyses were performed in this study. Plasma, blood, urine and faecal concentration, and radioactivity–time curves are presented as mean and standard deviation. PK parameters are summarized by descriptive statistics. Dose‐normalized geometric mean ratios and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed for PK parameters for oral versus IV dosing to estimate absolute bioavailability. 2.12 Nomenclature of targets and ligands Key protein targets and ligands in this article are hyperlinked to corresponding entries in http://www.guidetopharmacology.org, the common portal for data from the IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY, 14  and are permanently archived in the Concise Guide to PHARMACOLOGY 2017/18. 15 
 3 RESULTS 3.1 Subjects Sixteen healthy volunteers were enrolled in Part 1 of the study; 13 (81.3%) were male and three (18.8%) were female with an average (range) age of 36 (19–51) years, weight of 81.5 (59.4–96) kg, and BMI of 26.2 (21.7–31.2). Of the subjects included, 10 (62.5%) self‐identified as white, five (31.3%) as black or African American, and one (6.3%) as Asian. All subjects in Part 1 completed the study and were included in all analyses. Eight healthy male volunteers, independent from Part 1 of the study, were enrolled in Part 2 of the study. Subjects had an average (range) age of 36 (23–46) years, weight of 81.7 (60.5–102) kg, and BMI of 25.6 (19.6–30.5). Of the subjects included, six (75%) identified as white, and two (25%) as black or African American. Seven subjects completed Part 2 of the study; one discontinued on Day 13 (withdrawal by subject). 3.2 Pharmacokinetics 3.2.1 Part 1: Absolute bioavailability Plasma pharmacokinetic parameters for navoximod following IV (5 mg, push over 3–5 min) and oral (200 mg tablet) administration are presented in Table  1  and mean concentration–time profiles are presented in Figure  1 . The geometric mean exposure ratio (oral/IV) for dose normalized AUC 0‐∞ , as the measure of absolute bioavailability, was 0.555 (geometric % coefficient of variation [%CV]: 22.3%). The geometric mean (range) terminal elimination half‐life was consistent for oral (11.0 [6.96–14.3] hours) and IV (12.6 [9.22–20.4] hours) dosing. The geometric mean (%CV) navoximod plasma clearance and volume of distribution following IV infusion were 62.0 L/h (21.0%) and 1120 L (28.4%), respectively. The geometric mean (%CV) apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (V/F) for orally administered navoximod were 112 L/h (31.4%) and 1780 L (31.9%).

Figure 1 Log‐linear plot of mean (± SD) plasma navoximod concentration following administration of a 200 mg oral tablet (open triangles) or a 5 mg IV solution (closed circles) 3.2.2 Part 2: Mass balance The single mass dose of [ 14 C]‐navoximod ranged from 191 to 192 mg and the radioactive dose of [ 14 C]‐navoximod ranged from 600 to 604 μCi. Pharmacokinetic parameters for unlabelled navoximod and total radioactivity in plasma and whole blood are summarized in Table  2 ; mean concentration–time profiles are presented in Figure  2 . Following oral administration of a 200 mg/600 μCi solution of [ 14 C]‐navoximod, median  t 
 max  for navoximod in the plasma and total radioactivity in the blood was 0.5 hours, while  t 
 max  for total radioactivity in the plasma was 0.75 h. Thereafter, plasma concentrations of navoximod declined with a geometric mean (range) half‐life of 9.41 (7.54–12.8) hours, while total radioactivity in the plasma and whole blood had substantially longer half‐lives of 143 (79.6–190) and 206 (64.3–336) hours, respectively. Total plasma radioactivity concentrations were significantly higher than navoximod plasma concentrations. Geometric mean  C 
 max  and AUC 0‐∞  ratios indicated that navoximod represented 10.6% and 4.21%, respectively, of plasma total radioactivity, suggesting the presence of circulating metabolites.

Figure 2 Log‐linear mean (± SD) plasma concentration time profile of navoximod (open triangles), and mean (± SD) plasma (closed circle) and whole blood (open square) concentration profiles of [ 14 C]‐navoximod following oral administration of 200 mg/600 μCi [ 14 C]‐navoximod The blood‐to‐plasma ratio was determined from the total radioactivity, which included both parent and metabolites. The geometric mean whole blood to plasma AUC 0‐∞  ratio for total radioactivity was 0.965. Blood‐to‐plasma ratios increased from 0.5 to 1.6 over the duration of the study, indicating slightly higher association of [ 14 C]‐radioactivity towards blood cells with time. Since the half‐life of total radioactivity is more than 10 times longer than the half‐life of navoximod, the changes of the blood‐to‐plasma ratio over time is likely related to metabolites rather than navoximod. Cumulative recovery of total radioactivity in urine and faeces following administration of [ 14 C]‐navoximod is presented in Figure  3 . The mean total recovery of the radioactive dose in excreta up to 336 h post dose was 87.8%, with 85.0% of the total radioactivity recovered within the first 72 h. The majority of the total radioactivity was eliminated in the urine, with mean ± SD recoveries of 80.4% ± 5.53% and 7.44% ± 3.82% in the urine and faeces, respectively. Figure 3 Mean (± SD) cumulative recovery of total [ 14 C] radioactivity following oral administration of 200 mg/600 μCi [ 14 C]‐navoximod expressed as a percentage of the administered [ 14 C] dose in excreta, urine + faeces (triangles), urine (circles), and faeces (squares) 3.3 Extraction recovery of metabolite profiling samples The extraction recoveries of the radioactivity from plasma samples decreased over time, with 95.0% of the radioactivity extracted from the 0.5‐hour post‐dose plasma sample and 52.5% of the radioactivity extracted from the 48‐hour post‐dose plasma sample. The majority of the circulating radioactivity at ≥72 hours post‐dose was not extractable (extraction recoveries were 27–38%). The extraction recoveries of the AUC 0–48 hour  pooled plasma samples among the eight subjects were 76.1–86.5%. The plasma samples were extracted multiple times until the radioactivity in the supernatant was below the detection limit of the liquid scintillation counter. Therefore, the unextracted radioactivity was presumed to be tightly associated with plasma proteins. The extraction recoveries of faecal homogenate were 83.3–109% ( n  = 8). 3.4 Navoximod metabolite profiling and identification Representative HPLC radiochromatograms of pooled 0–48 h plasma, plasma at 72 h and 120 h, pooled urine and pooled faeces are presented in Figure  S1 . The protonated molecular ion [M + H] +  and major product ions observed by high resolution full scan and MS 2  experiments for navoximod and its metabolites are listed in Table  S1 . The discussion of MS/MS fragment interpretation of navoximod and its metabolites is also provided in the supplemental information. The relative abundances and exposures of navoximod and its metabolites in plasma, and their percentage of dose detected in urine and faeces are provided in Table  3 . The proposed biotransformation pathways are presented in Figure  4 . In the pooled 0–48 h plasma, unchanged parent, navoximod, was a minor component in circulation, with an AUC 0–48  of 4.40 μM.h (7.00% of the total exposure at 0–48 h). M28 (glucuronide conjugate of navoximod on the hydroxyethyl moiety) was the most prominent metabolite up to 48 h post‐dose, with an AUC 0–48  of 36.4 μM.h (57.5% of the drug‐derived exposure). M19 (glucuronide of navoximod on hydroxyl of cyclohexane) was detected in circulation with an AUC 0–48  2.36 μM.h (3.14% of the total 0–48 h exposure). M1 was identified as thiocyanate, with an AUC 0–48  of 3.12 μM.h (5.54% of the exposure). Thiocyanate was likely formed through oxidative ring opening of imidazole followed by release of cyanide, which was converted to thiocynate in vivo. As thiocyanate is an endogenous material in humans, the levels of thiocyanate reported here were based on radioactivity and only accounted for the portion from navoximod.

Figure 4 Proposed biotransformation pathways of navoximod As total radioactivity had a relatively long half‐life, plasma samples at 72, 96, 120, 144 and 168–336 hours post‐dose as pooled samples across the eight subjects were analysed to investigate the nature of the long‐lasting radioactivity in circulation. M1 accounted for most of the extractable radioactivity at 72 and 96 hours post‐dose, and was the only detectable peak in the radioprofiles ≥120 hour post‐dose. M1 reached a maximal plasma concentration of 0.264 μM at 1 h followed by a slow decline that contributed to the apparent long‐lived circulating radioactivity. Urine was the major excretion route of navoximod‐related radioactivity and accounted for 80.4% of the administered dose. The metabolite profiles of pooled urine were very similar among the eight subjects. Unchanged navoximod was a minor component in urine and represented only 1.66% of the dose. M28 was the most prominent urinary metabolite, accounting for 59.7% of the dose. M19 was also an abundant metabolite, representing 8.74% of the dose. All other urinary metabolites were minor, each representing less than 2% of the administered dose. Only 7.44% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in faeces, indicating that faecal excretion was a minor route of elimination for navoximod‐related radioactivity. The metabolite profiles from the pooled faeces were similar among the eight subjects. Unchanged navoximod represented 3.79% of the dose. M17 (oxidation, +34 Da) accounted for 1.54% of the dose. All other metabolites in faeces represented less than 1% of the administered dose. 3.5 Safety and tolerability All IV and oral doses in both parts of the study were generally well tolerated and all adverse events were mild in severity. There were no clinically significant changes in laboratory test parameters or in blood pressure, pulse rate, electrocardiographic or physical examination findings. 4 DISCUSSION This study investigated the absolute bioavailability of navoximod, determined the mass balance and routes of elimination of [ 14 C]‐navoximod, and characterized the metabolite profile. Results from this study demonstrate that navoximod has a fast, systemic clearance, relative to hepatic blood flow, and high volume of distribution, with an absolute bioavailability following a single oral dose of 200 mg navoximod of 55.5%. Approximately 87.8% of the radioactive dose was recovered in excreta up to 336 h post dose, most of which (85.0%) was recovered within the first 72 h. Most of the dose (80.4%) was eliminated in the urine while only 7.44% of the dose was excreted through faeces, indicating that the oral dose had been well absorbed. Full metabolite profiling of plasma, urine and faecal samples showed that navoximod is extensively metabolized. The major metabolic pathway of navoximod in humans was glucuronidation, with oxidation as a minor metabolic pathway. M28 (navoximod glucuronide) was the most abundant metabolite in circulation, accounting for most of the drug‐derived exposure. All the other circulating metabolites represented less than 10% of the total drug‐related exposure for all subjects. One metabolite with long half‐life was M1 (thiocyanate), reaching a maximal plasma concentration of 0.264 μM at 1 h, followed by a slow decline, contributing to the apparent long‐lived circulating radioactivity but accounting for &lt;0.1% of the administered dose and was eliminated in urine and faeces as a minor metabolite (&lt;1% of the dose). The level of  14 C‐thiocyanate (M1) in circulation from subjects dosed with 200 mg of navoximod is negligible compared to the endogenous thiocyanate levels in humans, which exist at significantly higher concentrations in the range of 50–150 μM. 16 ,  17 ,  18  The extractable component of the sample decreased at later time points as the total circulating radioactivity decreased such that after 72 h post‐dose most of the radioactivity was not extracted. This unextracted radioactivity at late time points was relatively low (e.g., 83.1 ng • equivalents/mL at 72 h) and represented &lt;0.1% of the administered dose. The disposition of navoximod and its metabolites following a single oral dose of 200 mg navoximod to healthy volunteers is presented in Figure  5 . The fraction of the dose absorbed (F a ) was estimated to be 0.841 using the sum of radioactivity recovered in urine (80.4%) and radioactivity in faeces that was characterized as metabolites (3.65%). F a  could be higher than 0.841 because part of the unchanged navoximod recovered in faeces could come from glucuronide metabolites (M19, M28, and M38) that were reverted to parent by glucosidase in the gastrointestinal tract or from the absorbed parent drug through biliary excretion. The hepatic first pass extraction was determined to be ~34%. With 55.5% of the oral dose entering systematic circulation (corresponding to F), only 1.66% was recovered as the unchanged navoximod in urine. Approximately 82.4% of the dose was recovered as metabolites with the majority in urine (78.7%). The fraction of metabolism (fm) was estimated to be 0.98. Figure 5 Model of mass balance, excretion and fraction of metabolism (fm) for an oral dose of navoximod It is interesting to note that total IV clearance was high (62 L/hour, ~71% of blood flow), but bioavailability was moderate (0.555). The observed bioavailability was higher than anticipated if all clearance mechanisms were attributed to hepatic clearance, suggesting significant extra‐hepatic clearance pathway involved in the elimination of navoximod in humans. Bioavailability is the product of F a , F g  and F h ; therefore, F h  * F g  is 0.66. UGT reaction phenotyping experiments identified UGT1A9 and 2B7 as the two major UGTs responsible for navoximod metabolism (unpublished results). UGT1A9 is highly expressed in kidney relative to the liver and UGT2B7 is predominately expressed in the kidney and liver with trace amounts in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume first‐pass gut metabolism is negligible (F g  = 1), and F h  is approximately 0.66. The hepatic clearance is then 29.6 L/hour (CL hep  = [1 − F h ] * Q h ). As the renal clearance is low (CL r  = [cumulative amount of unchanged navoximod excreted in urine over the sampling interval]/AUC 0‐∞  = 1.22 L/hour), the extrahepatic clearance is estimated to be 31.2 L/h. Since glucuronide metabolites detected in urine accounted for 70.2% of dose and UGT1A9 and 2B7 are mainly expressed in kidney, it is possible that metabolism through glucuronidation in the kidney could play a significant role in the clearance of navoximod. In conclusion, this study determined the absolute bioavailability, mass balance, elimination routes, and metabolite profiling and characterization of navoximod in healthy subjects. Navoximod was well tolerated and showed moderate oral bioavailability. Navoximod was quickly absorbed and extensively metabolized. The major metabolic pathway of navoximod was glucuronidation.

    <Body>What is Already Known about this Subject 
 Ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is linked with increased inflammation. The expression of galectin‐3 is upregulated in renal I/R injury. Ticagrelor could reduce myocardial I/R injury. 
 What this study Adds 
 Galectin‐3 is upregulated in the infarct area post myocardial I/R injury. Ticagrelor reduced I/R injury and myocardial galectin‐3 expression. Downregulating galectin‐3 in the infarct area post I/R might be a novel working mechanism of ticagrelor. 
 Introduction Although revascularization strategies have significantly reduced the acute mortality of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI)  1 , revascularization‐related myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury still remains an issue of concern in the modern interventional cardiology era  2 ,  3 . It is known that inflammation plays an important role in the pathophysiology of I/R injury  4 ,  5 ,  6 . Myocardial I/R injury‐induced inflammatory responses are typically associated with increased cytokines secretion, upregulated expression of cell adhesion molecules, and enhanced neutrophil infiltration and microvascular permeability  7 . Previous study revealed that platelets are crucially involved in inflammatory response in the process of I/R injury  8 , it was shown that platelets could enhance I/R injury by promoting inflammatory response in ischaemic myocardium  9 ,  10 . Enhanced inflammatory response by platelets is usually mediated through two signalling pathways: (1) via P‐selectin expressed on the surface of activated platelets, which could accelerate the binding of white blood cells and platelet, and the activated white cell system could then mediate the subsequent endothelial inflammation responses; and (2) via platelet‐dependent CD40 and CD40L interaction, which could enhance the synthesis of adhesion molecules, chemokines and tissue factors, resulting in the activation of matrix metalloproteinases and further upgrading the inflammation responses  8 . Recent research results indicate that anti‐inflammatory strategy may be one of the promising therapy options for cardiovascular diseases, including I/R injury  11 ,  12 ,  13 . In fact, previous studies have demonstrated that anti‐platelet therapy with ticagrelor, a new P2Y12 receptor antagonist, could effectively attenuate I/R injury and I/R injury‐related inflammatory responses  14 ,  15 . Accumulating evidence suggests that galectins play an important role in regulating the physiological and pathological processes of I/R injury via modulating the inflammatory responses  16 . Galectin‐3 is one of the most studied galectins and there is mounting evidence to suggest that it is actively involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases  17 . Galectin‐3 is a multi‐functional lectin with a broad range of actions, including promotion of neutrophil adhesion, induction of oxidative stress, mastocyte migration and degranulation. It is known that macrophages, as well as many other cells, such as neutrophils, eosinophils, mast cells and fibroblasts that all play important regulatory roles in the process of myocardial infarction, could produce galectin‐3  18 ,  19 . Previous studies found that galectin‐3 was actively involved in the pathophysiology of inflammation and fibrosis in heart, kidney, lung, liver and other organs through activating fibroblasts and enhancing macrophage infiltration  20 ,  21 . Li  et al .  22  found that enhanced myocardial injury after I/R injury in mice deficient in Akt2 was associated with increased cardiac macrophage density and macrophage marker galectin‐3. Sanchez‐Mas  et al .  23  reported that the mRNA expression of galectin‐3 in the infarcted area was the highest at 1 week after myocardial infarction and then gradually decreased in the next few weeks. Hashmi and Al‐Salam  24  also showed significantly upregulated mRNA and protein expressions of galectin‐3 at 60 min and 24 h after myocardial infarction in mice. Our group recently demonstrated that inflammation might participate in the worsening cardiorenal functions and remodelling processes post aortocaval fistula in unilateral nephrectomized rats  25 , and significant upregulation of galectin‐3 expression in the hearts and kidney was evidenced in this model  26 . These data collectively indicate that upregulated myocardial galectin‐3 expression might be an important determinant responsible for the initiation and progression of various myocardial diseases. It remains unknown if the previously reported cardioprotective effects of ticagrelor in I/R injury models might also be related to its role in modulating myocardial galectin‐3 expression. We therefore tested the hypothesis that ticagrelor might reduce myocardial I/R injury in rats at least partly via downregulating the myocardial galectin‐3 expression. Methods Animal groups Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats, weighing 200–250 g, were purchased from the Experimental Animal Center of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. The rats were divided into the following groups:
 Sham group ( n  = 5 each): 24‐h sham‐operated group; 3‐day sham‐operated group; 7‐day sham‐operated group. Rats in sham‐operated groups underwent similar surgical procedures without ligating the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Placebo group ( n  = 5 each): 24‐h placebo group, 3‐day placebo group and 7‐day placebo group. Rats in the placebo groups received equal volume saline per gastric gavage immediately after ligation of LAD, then once daily post LAD ligation till the study end. Ticagrelor group ( n  = 5 each): 24‐h ticagrelor group; 3‐day ticagrelor group; 7‐day ticagrelor group. Rats in ticagrelor groups received ticagrelor [150 mg kg −1 , 10 mg ticagrelor dissolved in 1 ml saline] per gastric gavage (3 to 3.75 ml) immediately after LAD ligation, then once daily till the study end. The dose of 150 mg kg −1  of ticagrelor was chosen based on a previous study showing that this dose (per oral gavage, once daily for 7 days) could significantly reduce the infarct size in male Sprague–Dawley rats that underwent 30‐minute coronary artery ligation and 24‐h reperfusion  27 . 
 The experiment protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Puai Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. All experiments were conducted in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines and in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guide for the care and use of laboratory animals (NIH Publications No. 85‐23, revised 1996). Establishment of ischaemia–reperfusion model Rats were weighed and anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 3% pentobarbital sodium (50 mg kg −1 ). Rats were then intubated and connected with a small animal ventilator (ALC‐V8S, Shanghai Orcote Biotech Co., Ltd). Ventilator parameters were adjusted to: tidal volume of 3 ml per 100 g, ventilation frequency of 70 beats min −1 , and breathing ratio of 1:2. I/R injury was induced as previously described  28 . Briefly, a 5‐0 ophthalmic suture was placed around the left anterior descending coronary (LAD) after pericardiotomy following an incision in the left fourth intercostal. The LAD was completely ligated to obtain regional ischaemia. The visualization of pale colour in the myocardium distal to the occlusion served as evidence of effective LAD occlusion. After 45 min of ischaemia, blood flow was restored by releasing the ligature and the 5‐0 ophthalmic suture remained in position. The reperfusion of the ischaemic region was confirmed by visual inspection of the return of a bright red colour. The sham rats were subjected to the same surgical procedures as performed on the myocardial I/R rats but without LAD occlusion. Determination of myocardial infarct size Area at risk (AAR) and infarct size were determined as previously described  29 . Briefly, 24 h, 3 days or 7 days after reperfusion, the LAD was religated with the 5‐0 ophthalmic suture remaining in situ and 3 ml of 2% Evans blue dye (Fluka, Switzerland) was injected via the right jugular vein to stain non‐ischaemic myocardium and delineate the AAR. When the epicardial surface turned blue, the heart was harvested and the right atrium, the right ventricle and the left atrium were removed, the left ventricle was frozen and cut into 5–6 slices perpendicular to the base–apex axis. The mid‐LV slice (2‐mm thick) was weighed, the ischaemic and non‐ischaemic parts separated, frozen on dry ice and kept in the freezer (−80°C) until analysed. All other slices were weighed, scanned from both sides for the determination of the AAR and put in 1% triphenyltetrazolium chloride solution for 15 min at 37°C to distinguish viable myocardium from necrotic. After 24 h of incubation in 4% formaldehyde, slices were scanned again from both sides, and the extent of myocardial necrosis and the AAR were determined by planimetry of computer images (Image J, version 1.31, NIH, Bethesda, MD). Myocardial mRNA expression of galectin‐3, IL‐6 and TNF‐α in infarct area detected by real‐time PCR The total RNA was extracted from the frozen tissue using the TRIzol reagent (Ambion, Cat. No. 15596‐026, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the instruction provided by the manufacturers, and the mRNA was reverse transcribed using the reverse transcription kit PrimeScript RT Master Mix Perfect Real Time (Takara, Cat. No. RR036A, Otsu, Shiga, Japan) (1 μg). Real‐time polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect the expression of various cytokines by QuantiFast SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen, Cat. No. 208054, Germantown, Maryland, USA). Quantitative RT‐PCR analysis was performed using a T100‐Thermal Cycler (BIO‐RAD, Hercules, CA, USA) and a real‐time system (BIO‐RAD, Hercules, CA, USA). The PCR was set up to maintain 39 cycles at 95°C for 3 min, 95°C for 5 s, 56°C for 10 s, and 72°C for 25 s, 65°C for 5 s, 95°C for 50 s.

 TTGCTGACAATCTTGAGGGAG Myocardial galectin‐3 protein expression determined by Western blot The protein labelling was performed by chemiluminescence ECL colorimetric technique. The protein was first extracted from the tissue sample with lysate and then the extracted protein (10 μg) was added to the 12% SDS‐PAGE gel wells (concentrated glue 80 V 40 min, separation glue 120 V 50 min). After electrophoresis, the membrane was blocked in TBS solution containing 5% nonfat dry milk at room temperature for 2 h and then incubated overnight at 4°C. This was followed by 1:10 000 dilution of HRP‐labelled secondary antibody, incubated with the membrane at room temperature for 1 h. Finally, the protein expression was measured using a fully automated chemiluminescence analyser (Tanon‐5200, Shanghai Tianneng) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Rabbit anti‐galectin‐3 (113486, 1:10 000; GENETEX), anti‐GAPDH (1039, 1:10 000; ASPEN) and Goat Anti‐Rabbit IgG (PAB160011, 1:10 000; BIOSWAMP) were used to determine the myocardial protein expression of galectin‐3. Statistics All data were presented as mean ± standard deviation. The data were analysed using a homogeneity of variances test. Data with  P  &lt; 0.05 by the test of homogeneity of variances were analysed by the Games–Howell test. Data with  P  &gt; 0.05 by the test of homogeneity of variances were analysed by the Tukey HSD test. All data were analysed by SPSS22.0 statistical analysis software, and  P  &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Ticagrelor limits myocardial infarct size Compared to the placebo group, the IA/AAR ratio in the ticagrelor group was reduced 12.62% at 24 h (34.51 ± 12.19%  vs . 47.13 ± 12.42%,  P  = 0.144), 38.41% at 3 days (17.74 ± 9.9%  vs . 56.15 ± 9.44%,  P  &lt; 0.01) and 34.29% at 7 days (14.02 ± 5.08%  vs . 48.31 ± 19.01%,  P  &lt; 0.01) (Figure  1 ). Figure 1 Ratio of infarct area (IA)/area at risk (AAR). Ticagrelor (black circle) significantly reduced IA/AAR ratio at 3 days and 7 days post I/R injury compared to saline‐treated rats (open circle). IA/AAR ratio was also significantly lower at 3 days and 7 days compared to 24 h in ticagrelor group. **  P  &lt; 0.01 vs. placebo group.  #   P  &lt; 0.05  vs . 24 h,  ##   P  &lt; 0.01  vs . 24 h Myocardial mRNA expression of galectin‐3, TNF‐α and IL‐6 in sham‐operated rats and in infarct area post I/R injury Myocardial galcectin‐3 mRNA expression was low in sham‐operated rats, and was significantly upregulated at 24 h, 3 days and 7 days post I/R injury in the infarct area of placebo groups, which was significantly higher at 3‐day and 7‐day groups compared to the 24‐h group post I/R injury in placebo‐treated rats. Ticagrelor treatment significantly downregulated galcectin‐3 mRNA expression in the infarct area at 24 h, 3 days and 7 days post I/R injury (Figure  2 A) as compared to placebo‐treated rats. Compared to the sham group, myocardial galcectin‐3 mRNA expression increased 3.12‐fold in the placebo group and 1.95‐fold in the ticagrelor group at 24 h; increased 10.80‐fold in the placebo group and 6.45‐fold in the ticagrelor group at 3 days; increased 12.26‐fold in the placebo group and 7.45‐fold in the ticagrelor group at 7 days. As shown in Figure  2 A, that relative mRNA expression of galectin‐3 is higher at 3 days and 7 days compared to 24 h in the placebo group, which is line with previous findings showing that galectin‐3 mRNA expression peaked at 7 days in the infarct area  23 . Figure 2 mRNA expression of galectin‐3 (A), TNF‐ α (B) and IL‐6 (C) in the myocardial tissue of sham group (white bar), placebo group (gray bar) and ticagrelor group (black bar) in infarct area at 24 h, 3 days and 7 days post I/R. *  P  &lt; 0.05  vs . sham‐operated group;  †

Ticagrelor treatment significantly downregulated TNF‐α mRNA expression in the infarct area at 24 h, 3 days and 7 days post I/R injury compared to placebo‐treated rats. mRNA expression of IL‐6 was significantly upregulated at 24 h, then reduced at 3 days and 7 days post I/R, which were significantly higher than in the respective sham groups at all three measured time points in the placebo groups. Ticagrelor treatment significantly downregulated IL‐6 mRNA expression in infarct area at 3 days and 7 days post I/R as compared to placebo‐treated rats (Figure  2 C). As shown in Figure  2 C, mRNA expression of IL‐6 was lower at 3 days and 7 days than in 24 h in the placebo group. This result is in line with a previous finding showing that IL‐6 peaked at 24 h in 93 patients receiving thrombolytic treatment for their first AMI  30 . Protein expression of galcectin‐3 in myocardial tissue of sham rats and in infarct area of rats post I/R injury As shown in Figure  3 , protein expression of galcectin‐3 was significantly upregulated in the infarct area from 24 h to 7 days post I/R in placebo groups, which was significantly higher at 3 days and 7 days post I/R compared to 24 h post I/R in placebo‐treated rats. Ticagrelor treatment significantly downregulated protein expression of galcectin‐3 in the infarct area at 24 h, 3 days and 7 days post I/R as compared to placebo‐treated rats (Figure  3 A,  3 B). Figure 3 (A) S1, S3 and S7 represents sham group at 24 h, 3 days and 7 days; P1, P3, P7 represents placebo group at 24 h, 3 days and 7 days; T1, T3, T7 represents ticagrelor group at 24 h, 3 days and 7 days.

Ticagrelor is a reversibly binding and selective oral P2Y12 antagonist, the disposition and metabolism of which has been investigated in mice, rats and marmosets. The results of those studies showed that the metabolic profiles were similar between these animal species and humans, and the  in vivo  metabolite profiles were also qualitatively similar across all species  31 . The plasma concentration of oral ticagrelor peaked at 2 h and the half‐life ranged from 10.9 to 14.9 h. The average absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor was approximately 36% (range 25.4–64.0%) in humans  32 . The observed cardioprotective results represented by reduced infarct area and myocardial proinflammatory cytokine levels from our study are in line with previous finding showing that a single acute dose of ticagrelor via intraperitoneal injection (30 mg kg −1 ) 5 min before reperfusion significantly reduced infarct size and reduced the proinflammatory cytokine levels in a rat ischaemia/reperfusion model  15 . It is noted that IA/AAR ratio tended to be lower at 24 h as compared to 3 days and 7 days in the placebo‐treated rats ( P  &gt; 0.05). Although not statistically significant, this deviation should be kept in mind when interpreting the data for potential bias in the analysis process. IA/AAR ratio was significantly lower at 3 days and 7 days as compared to 24 h in the ticagrelor group (both  P  &lt; 0.05), which suggests that the drug accumulation in rats after 3 days and 7 days might contribute to the stronger cardioprotective effects of ticagrelor, which has a half‐life around of 10.9–14.9 h  32 . Beyond above findings, we showed for the first time that ticagrelor application post LAD also significantly downregulated the galectin‐3 expression in infarct area; thus, the cardioprotective effects of ticagrelor might also be associated with its modulating effects on galectin‐3 expression in the ischaemic area in this rat model of I/R injury. Multiple mechanisms have been indicated for the beneficial effects of ticagrelor in attenuating ischaemic insult, including increasing myocardial adenosine levels, augmenting the phosphorylation of the pro‐survival kinases Akt and ERK 1/2 and endothelial NO synthase  15  as well as inhibiting glandular transporter (ENT‐1) on erythrocytes glycoside reuptake, strengthening of the local adenosine response, and vasodilation  14 ,  27 ,  33 . Previous studies also suggested that the cardioprotective effects of ticagrelor was independent of its role in inhibition of platelet aggregation, as the cardioprotective effects were not observed post clopidogrel application  14 ,  15 . Beyond the above knowledge on the potential therapeutic mechanisms of ticagrelor in I/R injury models, the present study results suggest that the observed cardioprotective effects of ticagrelor might at least partly be mediated through downregulating the expression of galectin‐3 in the infarct area in this rat model of I/R injury. Supportive data are reported by Fernandes Bertocchi  et al ., who demonstrated that galectin‐3 knockout animals presented less acute tubular necrosis and a more prominent tubular regeneration when compared with wild‐type controls, concurrently with lower expression of MCP‐1, IL‐6, IL‐1beta, less macrophage infiltration and lower ROS production in mice models of renal I/R  34 . Accordingly, Cohen and colleagues revealed that the reno‐protective effects of a reno‐protective cocktail was accompanied by the reduced tissue galectin‐3 level in a rat model of renal ischaemia  35 . The above evidence, including ours, thus collectively indicate a crucial role of galectin‐3 in ischaemia injuries of various organs, and targeted downregulating of galectin‐3 might be a promising anti‐ischaemic strategy. Although we did not observe the impact of ticagrelor on inflammatory cell infiltration in the infarct area, including macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, mast cells and fibroblasts, which are all capable of producing galectin‐3, our results indirectly suggest that the reduced expression of galectin‐3 in the infarct area might be the result of reduced inflammatory cell infiltration in this area post ticagrelor use. We have no data to show whether or not the downregulation of galectin‐3 expression in the infarct area of rats by ticagrelor is dose‐dependent, but future studies are planned to address this issue. Future studies using galectin‐3 antagonist are warranted to show the direct therapeutic evidence in both  in vivo  and  in vitro  I/R models and prove the hypothesis that targeting galectin‐3 is a novel anti‐inflammatory and anti‐ischaemic strategy in heart, liver, kidney and cerebral diseases.

    <Body>WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT Octreotide is a synthetic somatostatin analogue used clinically for over 25 years in the treatment of acromegaly and neuroendocrine tumours. The currently marketed long acting formulation (octreotide LAR) requires a multistep reconstitution procedure and is administered intramuscularly. A phase I pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic and safety study was conducted to evaluate octreotide s.c. depot, a novel formulation of octreotide based on lipid-crystal technology, the unique characteristics of which potentially offer practical advantages over the existing LAR formulation. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS Compared with octreotide LAR, octreotide s.c. depot provided greater octreotide bioavailability with stronger and more rapid onset of suppression of IGF-1, as well as similar duration of effect, in healthy volunteers, with a safety profile generally comparable with that of the LAR formulation. Introduction Somatostatin analogues (SSAs) are the current standard of safe and effective medical therapy for acromegaly and symptom control in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NET) [ 1 – 3 ]. In addition, SSAs show promising antitumour effects and are a management option for tumour control in patients with unresectable NETs [ 4 – 6 ]. Currently marketed somatostatin analogues include octreotide immediate release (IR; Sandostatin®, Novartis) and its long acting formulation octreotide LAR (Sandostatin® LAR®, Novartis), as well as lanreotide (available in two formulations: Somatuline® LA® and Somatuline® Autogel®/Depot®, Ipsen). Octreotide LAR is a depot formulation based on polymer microsphere technology that is administered as a once monthly intramuscular injection and available as a powder for suspension. The reconstitution procedure requires refrigerated storage and encompasses seven different preparation steps, including very gentle handling to ensure homogenous suspension of the product before it can be administered. Owing to the clinical handling procedure and the intramuscular site of injection, octreotide LAR requires administration by a specially trained healthcare professional. In current clinical practice, many patients are cared for by specialist centres and often have to travel long distances for clinic visits, and the availability of a ready-to-use octreotide formulation that can be self or partner administered would result in added convenience. Octreotide subcutaneous (s.c.) depot (Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland) is a novel, ready-to-use octreotide formulation that has been developed using FluidCrystal® technology (Camurus AB, Lund, Sweden) in order to address the limitations of the LAR formulation. Octreotide s.c. depot is a liquid solution based on naturally occurring lipids, which permits the use of thin needles (22–27 G). When injected into subcutaneous or intramuscular tissue, the depot formulation absorbs interstitial aqueous fluid, resulting in  in situ  transformation from liquid into a highly viscous liquid-crystal gel phase [ 7 , 8 ]. The formation of the liquid-crystal phase is a spontaneous process resulting from lipid self-assembly that begins immediately upon injection. The immediate onset of gel formation upon injection results in effective encapsulation of the drug compound from the depot matrix, providing a fast initial release (without burst) followed by a slower and consistent release of the drug. The depot is finally biodegraded in the subcutaneous or intramuscular tissue. We report here an analysis from a phase I study that describes the pharmacokinetics (PK), the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect on secretion of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and the safety and tolerability profiles of three formulation variants of octreotide s.c. depot compared with octreotide LAR in healthy volunteers. Methods Subjects Healthy male and female (not pregnant or lactating) volunteers aged 21–50 years with a body mass index of 19 to &lt;30 kg m –2  were eligible for enrolment. Subjects were excluded if they used any prescription or non-prescription drugs or dietary supplements within 7 days, insulin or hypoglycaemic drugs within 2 months, oestrogen-containing medication within 2 months, or drugs that may affect growth hormone and IGF-1 levels (e.g. α-adrenergic, β-adrenergic and cholinergic drugs) within 1 month prior to dosing. The study was approved by an independent ethics committee (Medical Association of North Rhine, approval number 2011310) and complied with the International Conference of Harmonization (ICH) Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, the Declaration of Helsinki and local laws. All subjects provided written informed consent. Study design and treatments This phase I trial was a randomized, open label, repeat dose, active control, parallel group study (EudraCT number: 2011-001548-31). During a run-in period, subjects ( n  = 122) had to receive a single dose s.c. injection of octreotide IR 200 µg on day 0 in order to provide a normalizing reference for octreotide bioavailability and IGF-1 response. After a 7 day washout period, subjects were randomized to one of eight groups to receive three repeat once monthly injections on study days 7, 35 and 63: octreotide s.c. depot A 10, 20, 30 mg, octreotide s.c. depot B 30 mg, octreotide s.c. depot C 10, 20, 30 mg or octreotide LAR 30 mg. The composition of each octreotide s.c. depot variant was based on findings from preclinical pharmacokinetic studies, as well as earlier phase I clinical studies of similar depot formulations. All variants had a 1 : 1 ratio of the functional lipid excipients phosphatidylcholine and glycerol dioleate, but with varying co-solvent levels. The depot formulations were provided in glass vials for s.c. administration with conventional syringes with 23 G, thin-walled, 16 mm injection needles. Octreotide IR and the octreotide s.c. depot variants were administered as s.c. buttock injections. Octreotide LAR was administered as an intragluteal buttock injection following reconstitution with a 19 G, 38 mm injection needle. For the octreotide s.c. depot 10 mg, 20 mg and 30 mg (octreotide base) formulations, injection volumes administered were 0.5 ml, 1.0 ml and 1.5 ml, respectively. For octreotide LAR 30 mg (octreotide base), the injection volume was 2.5 ml. Dose selection and timing of injections were based on data from previous studies of octreotide s.c. depot (10, 20 and 30 mg) and the approved summary of product characteristics for octreotide IR 200 µg [ 9 ] and octreotide LAR 30 mg [ 10 ]. Given the similar composition of the octreotide s.c. depot B and C variants, only one dose of octreotide s.c. depot B was assessed as these variants were expected to have similar PK profiles. Objectives The primary objective of the study was to characterize the PK profiles of octreotide following three repeat once monthly injections of octreotide sc depot A, B and C. Secondary objectives included comparison of the PK and characterization and comparison of the PD profiles following three repeat once monthly injections of octreotide s.c. depot A, B and C  vs . octreotide LAR, assessment of the safety and tolerability of repeated injections of octreotide s.c. depot A, B and C and octreotide LAR and assessment of the bioavailability of octreotide when administered as octreotide s.c. depot A, B and C compared with octreotide LAR and IR. Pharmacokinetic assessments Blood samples for PK analysis of octreotide IR were collected pre-injection (≤45 min before the injection) and at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 45 min and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h post-injection. For randomized treatments, blood samples were collected pre-injection (≤45 min before the injection) and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h post-injection on days 7, 35 and 63, on days 8, 9, 11, 14, 21, 28, 36, 37, 39, 42, 49, 56, 64, 65, 67, 70, 77, 84 and 91 and at the follow-up visit on day 105. Octreotide concentrations were analyzed in plasma containing dipotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid using a validated bioanalytical method (PPD, Richmond, Virginia, USA). A 200 µl matrix aliquot was diluted with 200 µl of 4% phosphoric acid and fortified with 50 µl of 30 ng ml –1  internal standard ([ 13 C 6 Phe 3 ]octreotide) working solution. Analytes were isolated through solid phase extraction by using Oasis WCX μElution plates. The final extract was analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography with column switching and tandem mass spectrometry detection by using positive-ion electrospray detection. The nominal octreotide quantification range was 0.025–25.0 ng ml –1 . Precision (CV %) and accuracy (difference from theoretical concentration) were evaluated by replicate analyses of human plasma quality control pools prepared at five concentrations spanning the calibration range. The inter-assay coefficients of variation of the quality controls ranged from 4.0% to 7.6%, with the mean percentage differences from theoretical ranging from 0.8% to 4.7%. For analytical runs which contained diluted subject samples, the appropriate level quality control pool was diluted and analyzed in a similar manner to validate the dilution of study samples. All original and incurred reproducibility samples were analyzed in 75 runs that met the acceptance criteria. Assay reproducibility was good, with 98.2% matching the original results within ≤20%. Pharmacodynamic assessments Blood samples for PD analysis of IGF-1 were collected at screening and on day 0 before injection of octreotide IR (≤45 min before the injection) and at 0.5, 1, 4, 12 and 24 h after injection. For subjects in all eight randomized groups, blood samples were collected at the following time points: pre-injection (≤45 min before the injection) and at 1, 4 and 12 h post-injection on days 7, 35 and 63, on days 8, 9, 11, 14, 21, 28, 36, 37, 39, 42, 49, 56, 64, 65, 67, 77, 84 and 91 and at the follow-up visit on day 105. IGF-1 concentrations in serum samples were determined using a validated method based on the Siemens Immulite 2000 IGF-1 assay, which is a solid phase, two site, sequential immunoluminometric assay (PPD Global Central Labs, Zaventem, Belgium). The lower limit of quantitation was 25 ng ml –1  and the assay dynamic range was 25–1600 ng ml –1 , with a validated precision (CV %) of ≤7.0% at two concentration levels within the calibration range. Determination of PK and PD parameters The following PK parameters were determined for octreotide: AUC(0,∞) area under the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC) from time zero to infinity, AUC(0, t last ) AUC from time of dosing to last measurable concentration, AUC(0,τ) AUC over the dosing interval,  C max  maximum plasma concentration from the first and third peaks,  t ½  apparent terminal half-life and  t max  time to maximum plasma concentration. The randomized treatments had a dosing interval of 28 days. The plasma concentration prior to the next dose,  C trough , was measured at 28, 56 and 84 days after drug administration of the sustained release products. The PK parameter estimations were conducted by using the default non-compartmental Model 200 (plasma data from extravascular dose input) in Phoenix WinNonlin (Version 6.3). Safety analysis Safety assessments included the evaluation of adverse events (AEs; coded using MedDRA Version 14.0 or later), local tolerability (erythema, swelling and pain), changes in vital sign measurements (pulse rate, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and body temperature), physical examination findings, electrocardiogram (ECG) and abdominal ultrasound results, time and duration of gastrointestinal AEs and clinical laboratory investigations. The clinical severity of AEs was classified and defined as mild (usually transient, potentially requiring only minimal treatment or therapeutic intervention, with the event not generally interfering with daily activities), moderate (usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention, with the event interfering with daily activities, causing discomfort but posing no significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject) and severe (either interrupts daily activities or significantly affects clinical status or may require intensive therapeutic intervention). Local tolerability at the injection site was assessed by a physician. Erythema and swelling assessments were based on a four point rating scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate and 3 = severe) and performed during regularly scheduled AE assessments, as well as 1 and 6 h after injection of the randomized treatments on days 7, 35 and 63. Pain assessments were performed by using a 0 to 10 point numeric rating scale (0 = no pain, 10 = the worst possible pain). Pain was self-assessed by the subject immediately after injection (i.e. assessment of the ‘pain on injection’) and at 0.5, 1 and 6 h following injection on days 0, 7, 35 and 63. Statistical analysis All subjects who received at least one dose of any octreotide treatment were included in the safety population. The PK analysis set included all randomized subjects in the safety population who had at least one post-dose PK measurement. The evaluable (EVAL) population set included all randomized subjects in the safety population who had a complete PK profile for the third dose of randomized treatment. PK and PD analyses were summarized using descriptive statistics. All statistical analyses were performed with SAS® software (Version 9.1.3). Steady-state conditions were determined by comparing the trough concentrations after the second and third injections for each treatment group using a paired  t -test. Analysis of dose proportionality and dose linearity was performed for octreotide s.c. depot A and C (only one dose of octreotide s.c. depot B was studied) using a linear regression of the dose-adjusted  C max  and AUC(0,τ) from the third injection  vs . dose. AUC was calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule. The relative bioavailability of the octreotide s.c. depot treatments was assessed using the PK variables (AUC(0,τ)) from the third injection with octreotide LAR as the reference and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the ratios of dose-adjusted parameters. Additionally, the relative bioavailability of octreotide when administered as s.c. depot and LAR formulations was assessed from the third injection using octreotide IR as the normalized reference (AUC(0,τ) [AUC(0,∞) for octreotide IR]) with 90% CIs for the ratios of dose-adjusted parameters. The AUC bioavailability of any two treatments was considered equivalent if the 90% CI of the ratio of the dose-adjusted AUCs was entirely within the range 0.75, 1.33. For the PD analyses, the response (absolute and percentage) in IGF-1 from baseline (before injection on day 7 for randomized treatments) was calculated at all sampling time points. The response values were summarized at each visit for each treatment, with descriptive statistics. Safety and tolerability variables were analyzed and summarized descriptively. Results Disposition of subjects Of the 123 subjects enrolled, 122 were randomized and 105 (85.4%) completed the study. Of the 18 subjects who discontinued, 10 (8.1%) withdrew consent, six (4.9%) discontinued because of an AE, one (0.8%) was withdrawn because of non-compliance with the protocol (subject tested positive for tetrahydrocannabinol) and one non-randomized subject (0.8%) withdrew because of pregnancy. All 123 subjects received at least one dose of octreotide (inclusive of octreotide IR) and were included in the safety population, 122 subjects were included in the PK population and 104 subjects were included in the evaluable population.

Following washout and administration of randomized treatments on day 7, the octreotide s.c. depot formulations and dose groups showed similar plasma concentration profiles, with consistent and rapid increases to  C max  followed by a slower decrease during the remainder of the 28 day dose interval. Subsequent injections showed qualitatively similar profiles (Figure 1 B–D).

By contrast, following the first injection of octreotide LAR 30 mg, an initial short burst-like release of octreotide was observed to an initial peak concentration, which then rapidly declined to undetectable concentrations, followed by a rebound after about 1 week, reaching relatively stable concentrations from day 10. Concentrations then slowly decreased from day 21 post-injection (Figure 1 E). Qualitatively similar profiles were seen with subsequent octreotide LAR 30 mg injections, although the initial decay to undetectable concentrations was not observed. Differences in the PK profiles of octreotide s.c. depot B and octreotide LAR were evident following graphical superimposition (Figure 1 F). The mean  C max  following the 200 µg dose of octreotide IR was 6.95 ng ml –1 . The first doses of octreotide s.c. depot and octreotide LAR had mean  C max  values of 7.07–29.13 and 1.04 ng ml –1 , respectively (Table  2 ). Similarly, mean  C max  values following the third dose of octreotide s.c. depot treatments ranged from 8.9 to 34.5 ng ml –1  and it was 1.83 ng ml –1  for octreotide LAR. The mean  t ½  for octreotide IR was 3.09 h, while the mean  t ½  following the first dose of octreotide s.c. depot 10, 20 and 30 mg formulations ranged from 151 to 226 h. Median  t max  values following first injection ranged from 4 to 47 h for the octreotide s.c. depot formulations, compared with 336 h for octreotide LAR. Following the third injection, median  t max  ranged from 4 to 24 h for the octreotide s.c. depot formulations, compared with 1 h for octreotide LAR. For the third injection, mean AUC(0,τ) values ranged from 962 to 3778 ng ml –1  h for the octreotide s.c. depot 10, 20 and 30 mg doses. It was 733 ng ml –1  h for octreotide LAR 30 mg. The octreotide s.c. depot A, B and C 30 mg formulations all had similar PK profiles.

For the third injection, statistically significant differences were found for all dose-adjusted comparisons of AUC(0,τ) and  C max  for the octreotide s.c. depot formulations  vs . octreotide LAR. AUC(0,τ) ratios (for the EVAL population) ranged from 4.0 to 5.3, that is, the relative bioavailability for octreotide s.c. depot treatments  vs . octreotide LAR amounted to 400–530%.  C max  ratios (for the EVAL population) for octreotide s.c. depot  vs . octreotide LAR ranged from 13.3 to 18.4. The trough concentrations of octreotide s.c. depot formulations  vs . octreotide LAR were similar for comparable doses (Table  3 ). The relative bioavailability of the randomized octreotide s.c. depot formulations at steady-state was also compared with octreotide IR by assessment of the ratio between the dose-normalized AUC(0,τ) of the randomized groups (at third injection) and the AUC(0,∞) for octreotide IR. The relative bioavailability for octreotide s.c. depot formulations  vs . octreotide IR ranged from 0.684 to 0.907 (0.839 for the B variant) and was 0.172 for octreotide LAR  vs . octreotide IR (Table  3 ). Only the octreotide s.c. depot C 30 mg group did not show a statistically significant difference  vs . octreotide IR. Reduction of IGF-1 concentrations Suppression of mean IGF-1 concentrations was observed during the 24 h post-injection period of single dose octreotide IR for each of the treatment arms (Figure 2 A). The PD profiles after each injection of the octreotide s.c. depot formulations showed a relatively rapid initial reduction in IGF-1 concentrations, which gradually increased with time until the next injection (Figures 2 B–D). By contrast, octreotide LAR provided a slower and more gradual suppression of IGF-1 (Figure 2 E). Generally, the IGF-1 concentrations showed less variation over time for octreotide LAR compared with the octreotide s.c. depot formulations. However, noticeable transient increases of the IGF-1 concentrations were observed during the first few days following the second and third injections of octreotide LAR. Compared with octreotide LAR, all octreotide s.c. depot formulations and doses provided a more rapid and extensive suppression of IGF-1 after the first injection, whereas suppression of IGF-1 was more similar between the eight randomized treatments for the second and third injections (comparison with octreotide s.c. depot B shown for clarity, Figure 2 F). For both the first and third injections of octreotide s.c. depot A and C, suppression of IGF-1 was more pronounced at the higher dose (30 mg) compared with the lower 10 mg dose (Figure 3 ). Maximum inhibition after the third injection (steady-state) was highest for octreotide s.c. depot B (30 mg) and octreotide s.c. depot C (20 and 30 mg), with a mean inhibition of ∼45% in all cases (Table  4 ).

The most frequent AE was diarrhoea (92 subjects [75.4%] overall), which was reported in similar numbers across the octreotide s.c. depot treatment groups. Headache was the second most frequently reported AE (60 subjects [49.2%], Table  5 ). AEs were more frequent for the octreotide s.c. depot formulations (85.7–100%) compared with octreotide LAR (71.4%). However, there were no obvious differences in the types of AEs and the frequency of events by dose. Octreotide s.c. depot B and C (20 mg) had the smallest number of drug-related AEs (85.7% and 78.6%, respectively) among the different octreotide s.c. depot formulations. In all randomized subjects, diarrhoea and headache were the most frequent AEs during steady-state (24 [19.7%] and 20 subjects [16.4%], respectively). Gastrointestinal (GI) events were mild to moderate in severity and were generally of short duration. During the period of randomized treatment, six subjects (4.9%) experienced an AE leading to study discontinuation. Three subjects in the octreotide s.c. depot A (10 mg) group experienced one AE each of the following: syncope (severe, reported as a serious adverse event [SAE] as described below), diarrhoea (moderate) and increased lipase (severe) and blood amylase (moderate). One subject receiving octreotide s.c. depot A 20 mg had decreased thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, moderate), while increased lipase (mild) was recorded in one subject in the octreotide s.c. depot C (30 mg) group. Injection site pruritus (two events, one mild and one moderate) and erythema (two events, both mild) were experienced by one subject receiving octreotide s.c. depot A 30 mg. The outcome of all these AEs was reported as recovered. AEs leading to study discontinuation did not occur in subjects receiving octreotide s.c. depot B 30 mg, C 10 or 20 mg or octreotide LAR. Two subjects (1.6%) presented with a SAE. One subject who received octreotide s.c. depot A 10 mg had a SAE of syncope that was judged ‘possibly related’ to study drug. On the day of the first injection, the subject experienced a headache and developed abdominal pain and nausea followed by diarrhoea on the second day, and then vomiting and subsequent collapse on the third day. The subject was hospitalized the same day, treated and considered to have recovered from the event. The syncopal episode was likely a vegetative reaction attributable to the simultaneous occurrence of abdominal cramps and vomiting or an orthostatic collapse after diarrhoea and vomiting. The other SAE (accidental foot fracture and head lacerations) in a subject who received octreotide s.c. depot C (10 mg) was judged not to be study drug related. No deaths occurred during the study. Clinical laboratory evaluations and ECGs Clinically significant increases in lipase values were observed in eight subjects, seven of whom had mild abnormalities, two in the octreotide s.c. depot A 20 mg group, one each in the octreotide s.c. depot C 10 mg and 20 mg groups, two in the octreotide s.c. depot C 30 mg group (one of whom discontinued the study as a result) and one in the octreotide LAR group. One severe lipase increase in the octreotide s.c. depot-A 10 mg group led to study drug discontinuation and the subject subsequently recovered. One subject receiving octreotide s.c. depot C 30 mg experienced a moderate increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. In addition, one subject receiving octreotide s.c. depot A 20 mg had a clinically significant decrease in TSH that resulted in discontinuation (mentioned above). The outcome of all these laboratory abnormalities was reported as recovered. Glucose metabolism did not seem to be affected by study treatment, with no clinically significant abnormal glucose values reported. Furthermore, only one subject who received octreotide LAR 30 mg had an AE of cholelithiasis (mild). QT interval increases occurred in 13 subjects, one each in the octreotide s.c. depot A 10 mg and 20 mg, octreotide s.c. depot C 10 mg, 20 mg and 30 mg and octreotide LAR groups, two in the octreotide s.c. depot B 30 mg group and five in the octreotide s.c. depot A 30 mg group, including one subject who only presented with the AE after the injection of octreotide IR and one subject with a right bundle branch block assessed as unlikely to be related to the study drug. All these abnormalities were mildly prolonged QT c  intervals and none of the QT c  interval increases were reported as related to treatment. The analysis of QT c  interval increases showed that the event was recorded in 12 subjects randomized to one of the octreotide s.c. depot formulations (nine males and three females), resulting in a total of 23 AEs. In females, eight measurements of QT c B were above 450 ms and in males, there were 15 measurements above 450 ms. Considering QT c F, six occurrences were above 450 ms in females and in males, two measures of QT c F were above 450 ms. There were no QT c B/QT c F values over 480 ms. With regards to the increase from baseline, there were eight QT c B interval increases of &gt;30 ms, which occurred in two females (among them, one female with three occurrences) and four males. For QT c F, two measurements of &gt;30 ms from baseline where recorded in one female. There were no QT c B/QT c F interval increases from baseline &gt;60 ms. In addition to these data obtained for the octreotide s.c. depot formulations, there was one subject in the octreotide LAR group who had a QT c B of 480 ms but a pulse of 113 beats min –1  (QT c F 432 ms). Overall, there were no trends for the occurrence of abnormal laboratory parameters, vital signs, ECG parameters, or physical examinations observed during the study. Local tolerability In terms of local tolerability, it should be noted that the octreotide s.c. depot formulations were given by s.c. injection, whereas octreotide LAR was administered by deeper intramuscular injection. Only small numbers of subjects were found to have mild swelling across the treatment groups, with subjects receiving octreotide s.c. depot A 10 mg and octreotide LAR showing no cases of swelling at 1 and 6 h post-injection on days 7, 35 and 63. For the same time points, no cases of erythema were reported in subjects receiving octreotide s.c. depot A 30 mg or octreotide LAR, while instances of mild erythema did not exceed three cases in any of the other treatment groups. A majority of subjects reported pain at the injection site immediately following injections. However, at the 1 and 6 h post-injection time points for the overall population, ≥87.6% of subjects across treatment groups experienced no pain at the injection site. Discussion This phase I study set out to assess the PK, PD and safety and tolerability profiles of three variants of a novel octreotide s.c. depot formulation compared with octreotide LAR in healthy volunteers. The formulations chosen for the present study were selected based on  in vitro  and preclinical assessments to improve the therapeutic index by reducing  C max  values while increasing  C trough  values compared with earlier octreotide s.c. depot formulation variants, while at the same time facilitating injectability. The octreotide s.c. depot formulation variants (A, B and C) showed similar PK profiles, with a consistent and rapid increase to peak concentration, generally by 24–48 h, followed by a slow decay during the remainder of the 28 day dosing interval. The PK characteristics were markedly different for octreotide LAR and octreotide s.c. depot. The onset of octreotide release and therapeutic effect was near immediate after the first dose of the octreotide s.c. depot formulations, in contrast to octreotide LAR.  C max  for octreotide IR (200 µg) was 7.0 ng ml –1 , which was comparable with the mean  C max  values for the 10 mg doses of the octreotide s.c. depot formulations (approximately 9 ng ml –1 ). Mean  C max  for octreotide LAR 30 mg was 1.8 ng ml –1 . The establishment of steady-state conditions provided the basis for comparisons of the randomized treatments. Dose-normalized comparisons of AUC(0,τ) after the third injection of the octreotide s.c. depot variants  vs . octreotide LAR showed that octreotide s.c. depot had approximately four- to five-fold greater bioavailability than octreotide LAR. The corresponding  C max  ratio ranged from 13.3 to 18.4 at the same dose levels, while dose adjusted  C trough  concentrations were similar. Octreotide s.c. depot formulation variants showed dose proportionality and linearity over the range 10–30 mg (as observed from A and C). Although  C max  for the 30 mg doses of octreotide s.c. depot was higher compared with octreotide LAR 30 mg (27–35  vs . 1.8 ng ml –1 ) and the relative bioavailability of the octreotide s.c. depot formulations was four- to five-fold higher, the tolerability profile appeared comparable. The estimated therapeutic  C max  and exposure range for the starting clinical dose of octreotide s.c. depot B were comparable with those of prior clinical exposure reports in subjects receiving the marketed octreotide IR formulation (400 µg s.c.) [ 11 ]. Single dose  C max  was estimated to be 23.5 ng ml –1  and overall exposure can be extrapolated to multiple dose octreotide IR (400 µg s.c., three times a day) to give an AUC over a 28 day dosing interval of approximately 4416 ng ml –1  h, which is above the values reported here for AUC for the 30 mg doses of octreotide s.c. depot. Additionally, the octreotide IR label also supports even higher doses of 500 µg three times a day, as required in some patients to achieve maximum efficacy. Mean  t ½  values were, as expected, much longer for octreotide s.c. depot  vs . octreotide IR (approximately 200 h compared with 3.1 h, respectively). The bioavailability of octreotide LAR  vs . octreotide IR was significantly lower than for the octreotide s.c. depot formulations  vs . octreotide IR (0.172 for LAR  vs . 0.684–0.907 for octreotide s.c. depot formulations), in accordance with the relative bioavailability calculated by comparison of octreotide s.c. depot and octreotide LAR exposures, as discussed above. For octreotide s.c. depot A and C, there was a trend towards greater reductions in AUC percentage inhibition in IGF-1 with increasing dose. The observed variability in the profiles of depot variants A and C are probably related to differences in the group response, as the octreotide exposures are similar. Compared with octreotide LAR, all octreotide s.c. depot variants and doses provided a more rapid and extensive suppression of IGF-1 after the first injection and during the first 2 weeks after injection. Octreotide s.c. depot B 30 mg consistently demonstrated the lowest mean IGF-1 plasma concentrations (44–46% maximum suppression). The relatively large suppressions of IGF-1 for octreotide LAR 30 mg (36–41% maximum inhibition) observed for relatively low octreotide plasma concentrations may potentially be explained by the high pretreatment mean IGF-1 values measured in the octreotide LAR group. The three octreotide s.c. depot formulation variants were well tolerated, both locally and systemically. In accordance with the known safety profile of octreotide [ 1 , 9 , 10 , 12 ], the most frequent AEs for both the octreotide s.c. depot and LAR formulations were mild to moderate GI events. However, these tended to be of short duration. Injection local tolerability was generally good. Local discomfort was mild and transitory when it did occur. Octreotide s.c. depot offers several advantages over octreotide LAR, including a rapid onset of therapeutic effect followed by a sustained release of octreotide for up to 4 weeks. By contrast, the lag phase and slow onset of therapeutic octreotide concentrations after the first dose of octreotide LAR may require repeat daily injections of octreotide IR during the first 7–10 days after the first injection. The different PK profiles of the s.c. depot and LAR formulations are likely the result of different drug release characteristics. Octreotide LAR is encapsulated in a polymer formulation that provides controlled octreotide release from an intramuscular site [ 13 ]. In contrast, the s.c. depot formulation forms a gel matrix that encapsulates octreotide  in situ  at a subcutaneous site.  In situ  stability of the formulations and the rate and extent of biodegradation, which could be influenced by the composition of the formulation excipients, may then determine the subsequent release characteristics of active octreotide. The planned availability of octreotide s.c. depot as ready-to-use prefilled syringes combined with s.c. injection is also potentially advantageous  vs . the multistep reconstitution process and intramuscular injection of octreotide LAR [ 10 ]. These features parallel some of the perceived advantages attributed to lanreotide Autogel, which is available in a prefilled syringe and is given subcutaneously rather than intramuscularly. However, the high viscosity of the lanreotide Autogel formulation requires a thick needle (18 or 19 G, length 20 mm) for administration. This is in contrast to octreotide s.c. depot, which permits the use of a thinner needle (needle size 23 G, needle length 16 mm used in the present study). In conclusion, in healthy volunteers, octreotide s.c. depot provided approximately four- to five-fold greater octreotide bioavailability, with more rapid onset and similar duration of effect in terms of suppression of IGF-1, compared with octreotide LAR. Octreotide s.c. depot is a ready-to-use liquid formulation anticipated to be available in prefilled syringes and administered through a thin needle into the subcutaneous tissue. These unique characteristics offer practical advantages over the existing LAR formulation that may enhance convenience for patients and healthcare providers. Planned and ongoing studies of octreotide s.c. depot  vs . octreotide LAR in patients with acromegaly and patients with symptoms associated with GEP-NET will provide further insights into the benefits of this novel formulation. </Body>

    <Body>What is already known about this subject 
 There is no known cure to diabetic neuropathy, which may affect the central, autonomic or peripheral nervous systems and consequently reduces life expectancy and quality of life. In preclinical trials, glucagon‐like peptide‐1 agonist treatment has shown anti‐inflammatory and neuroprotective effects, and thus possesses a justified treatment option in diabetic neuropathy. Heightened levels of interleukin‐6 have been associated with reduced heart rate variability in type 1 diabetes, potentially indicating a specific importance of this cytokine in autonomic neuropathy. 
 What this study adds 
 Liraglutide elicited a reduction in interleukin‐6 in patients with long time type 1 diabetes and confirmed symmetrical polyneuropathy. There was a numerical reduction in other cytokines indicating anti‐inflammatory actions of liraglutide, however no improvement was shown in neural function, plausibly because the polyneuropathy had reached a point beyond reversibility. Clinically, liraglutide induced weight loss and improved microalbuminuria, confirming compliance to the study drug. 
 1 INTRODUCTION Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder associated with chronic low‐grade inflammation, oxidative stress and changes in endoneurial integrity, which can result in several complications such as polyneuropathy. In type 1 diabetes, the pancreatic islet β cells are the target of an autoimmune response, which destroys the insulin producing capacity. Different cytokines have been associated with islet mononuclear infiltrate and cell toxicity. 1  Systemic inflammation is typically quantified by assessing serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α) and interleukin (IL)‐1 and IL‐6. Such concomitant inflammation has been associated with marked neuronal loss leading to widespread disturbances in neuronal function in neurodegenerative diseases e.g. in Alzheimer's disease. 2  In addition, in vitro and in vivo studies provide convincing evidence that glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) agonists possess anti‐inflammatory and antioxidative effects, putatively mediated alterations in monocyte function, diminished macrophage infiltrations and subsequent inhibition of proinflammatory pathways. 3  Furthermore, preclinical studies of the effect of GLP‐1 agonists on the central nervous system have demonstrated beneficial effects on memory, synaptic brain plasticity and glucose metabolism. 4  In addition, experimental animal studies have indicated that GLP‐ 1 agonists (exenatide) may also exert direct neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects independent of its glycaemic effects. 5 ,  6 ,  7  For example, in diabetic and nondiabetic mice, GLP‐1 receptors are present on sensory neurons, axons, Schwann cells and dorsal root ganglia. Diabetic polyneuropathies are common and present in approximately 50% of adults with long‐term diabetes, the pathogenesis of which is multifactorial including vascular, metabolic, immune mediated and inflammatory pathways. 8  The clinical manifestations of polyneuropathy are pleomorphic and are associated with substantial socioeconomic burdens, and reduced quality of life. Polyneuropathy affects classically the peripheral axons in a length dependent manner leading to classical  stocking‐and‐glove  representation and is termed diabetic symmetric polyneuropathy (DSPN). These neuropathic changes coexists often with diabetic autonomic neuropathy and alterations of the structural and functional brain processing, which may be evident as a reduction in regional grey matter volume, microstructural damage within nerve tracts, and alterations in processing of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs). 9 ,  10 ,  11  Despite a negative proof‐of‐concept study evaluating the effect of exenatide, a GLP‐1 agonist, on measures of DSPN and cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) in patients with type 2 diabetes, it is, however, plausible that GLP‐1 agonists via an anti‐inflammatory mechanism could target the neuroinflammatory component of polyneuropathy, potentially leading to improved neuronal function of the central and peripheral nervous system in diabetes. 12 ,  13 
 Therefore, we hypothesized that treatment with a GLP‐1 agonist, improves neuronal function through diminished inflammation in type 1 diabetes, independent of glucose metabolism. The primary objective was to explore the neuronal function in response to anti‐inflammatory actions of liraglutide treatment and thus the secondary aim was to investigate the effect on inflammatory parameters. 2 METHODS 2.1 Study population We performed a prospective, randomized, double‐blinded, parallel‐group, placebo‐controlled trial at Aalborg University Hospital from June 2014 to January 2017. Patients were recruited at the Department of Endocrinology, and potential eligible patients were prescreened on the basis of a recorded vibration perception threshold above 18 V. All patients underwent nerve conduction tests to diagnose DSPN according to the Toronto criteria not more than 4 weeks prior to study entering. 14  Prior to entering the study, prescribed medication e.g. type of antihypertensive treatment was registered and within the safety window it was intended to limit alterations in such medication throughout the study. Additional inclusion criteria were age over 18 years, a verified diagnosis of type 1 diabetes for a minimum of 2 years: (glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] ≥6.5% [&gt;48 mmol/mol]), stable hyperglycaemic medication insuring that patients as minimum had received the given treatment (long acting and fast acting insulin or insulin pump with dosing adjustments according to regimens) for at least 3 months prior to study entrance, body mass index &gt; 22 kg/m 2  and written consent. Exclusion criteria included type 2 diabetes, other neurological disorders than DSPN, estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; calcitonin &gt;25 ng/L, HbA1c level &lt; 6.5%, use of GLP‐1 agonists or DPP‐4 inhibitors. Treatments were masked and appeared identical and were randomly assigned 1:1 liraglutide or placebo in blocks of 8, generated from a randomization list provided by the drug supplier. The intervention was titrated over a 6‐week period to a dose between 1.2–1.8 mg/d, depending on tolerability. The treatment was continued for a further 26 weeks. Dropouts/withdrawals were mirror randomized. Ethical approval was granted by Region Nordjylland, Denmark (N‐20130077) and all participants gave written informed consent prior to entry. The study was registered in public databases (EUDRA CT, ref 2013–004375‐12; and  http://clinicaltrials.gov , ref NCT02138045) and performed in accordance with International Council for Harmonization Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants underwent multiple tests over a period of 3 study days at baseline. All experimental procedures were performed between 8 AM and noon. Follow‐up was performed after 26 weeks of intervention. 2.1.1 Central neuronal assessment—electrical stimulation and evoked potentials Electrical stimulation was applied using surface electrodes (15 × 15 mm, Neuroline 700, Ambu A/S, Ballerup, Denmark) at the right median nerve (medial to the palmaris longus tendon and directly proximal to the right wrist) in order to elicit somatosensory evoked potential (SEP). A computer‐controlled electrical stimulator (Noxitest IES 230, Aalborg, Denmark) using bespoke software (LabVIEW, Custom made at Aalborg University, Denmark) delivered the electrical stimulus. The threshold at which thumb twitching was evident was found by slowly increasing the stimulus intensity in increments of 1 mA. Stimulus intensity was set at 1 mA above the twitch threshold and were delivered at 1 mA above the threshold in 2 trials of 1000 square pulses (0.2 ms, 2.3 Hz) at baseline and after 26 weeks of treatment at final dose. The peripheral and spinal neuronal activity was recorded through surface Ag/AgCl electrodes (Neuroline 710; Ambu A/S, Ballerup, Denmark). The recording electrodes were located on the ipsilateral Erb's point and referenced to the contralateral Erb's point. Additionally, recording electrodes were located over the C7 cervical spinous process (Cv7) referenced to an electrode placed above the jugular notch but below the glottis. The skin was lightly scratched with sandpaper at the location of each electrode to remove dead skin cells, in order to ensure the best possible recordings and the electrode impedance was kept below 2 kΩ. The data were recorded continuously at 20 kHz (SynAmp, Neuroscan, El Paso, TX, USA) and stored offline for analysis. Electroencephalographic signals were recorded with the Neuroscan System (Version 4.5; Compumedics, Charlotte, NC, USA) from 62 surface cylindrical Ag/AgCl scalp electrodes, by use of the extended 10–20 system montage (Quik‐Cap International; Compumedics). All participants were seated in supine position with their legs supported and eyes open during the entire recording. Conductive electrode gel was applied in each electrode to reduce the impedance below 10 kΩ, which was monitored using proprietary software (Neuroscan, Version 4.3.1; Compumedics). The electroencephalograph was recorded as continuous files with open online filters with a sampling rate of 1 kHz and stored for further analysis of electrically elicited evoked potentials. Assessment of SEPs is a reliable objective method for following upstream activity from the periphery to the spinal cord, to the brainstem and finally to the cortex. The reference electrode was situated between AFz and Fz, and therefore the polarity is inverted (e.g. our N14 corresponds to is P14 in other work 15 ). Early cortical activation was analysed at the negative potential (N20) and the positive potential (P22), at the centro‐parietal CP5 electrode contralateral to the stimulation, and the peak‐to‐peak amplitude was used. In a similar way the latencies and amplitude of the subcortical response (N14‐P18) was analysed at the occipital midline electrode (Oz), and late cortical response (N60‐P80) was assessed at the central midline electrode C1. 16 
 2.1.2 Systemic biochemistry, inflammatory profile and macrophage function Routine laboratory tests to monitor e.g. HbA1c, cholesterol and triglycerides were analysed at the Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Aalborg University Hospital. Fasting venous blood was collected and subsequently centrifuged at 800  g  for 10 minutes at room temperature. Plasma was immediately frozen at −80°C. Levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL1β, TNF‐α, IL‐6, IL‐8, IL‐10) were analysed by using a multiplex cytokine assay (Meso‐Scale Discovery, Rockville, MD, USA) and specific macrophage markers (sCD163 and sCD206) were analysed by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay at Department of Clinical Biochemistry at Aarhus University Hospital. 2.1.3 Autonomic neuronal assessment—cardiometric derived autonomic measures Twenty‐four‐hour Holter monitoring electrocardiographic recordings were undertaken (Lifecard CF; Del Mar Reynolds, Spacelabs Healthcare Inc., Snoqualmie, WA, USA), according to internationally recommended standard. 17  The initial recording period comprised a 10‐minute epoch where participants were instructed to relax followed by 2 × 15‐minute periods of guided respiratory rate of 15 breaths/min in the supine position followed by the same respiration rate in standing position. Blood pressure was simultaneously measured noninvasively in these 2 positions (Omron M4, Hoofddorp, Netherlands). Orthostatic hypotension was defined as &gt;20 mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure on standing. Twenty‐four‐hour heart rate variability (HRV) was assessed (Impresario Software version 3; Spacelabs Healthcare Inc., Snoqualmie, WA, USA), deriving HRV indices from within 5‐minute cycles of R‐R‐intervals. The following  time domain  HRV indices were obtained: standard deviation of the averages of NN intervals in all 5‐minute segments of a 24‐hour recording, reflecting autonomic imbalance (both sympathetic and parasympathetic tone); and the root mean square of difference of successive normal R‐R intervals reflecting parasympathetic tone. 18  In addition, fast Fourier transformation provided the following frequency domain HRV indices: derived total power, very low frequency, low frequency, high frequency and the low/high frequency ratio (reflecting sympatico–vagal balance). All HRV indices were adjusted for baseline heart rate. 19  Furthermore, validated measures of cardiac vagal tone and cardiac sensitivity to the baroreflex were derived. 20  Both cardiac vagal tone and cardiac sensitivity to the baroreceptor are real time measures of efferent and afferent brainstem influence on the heart (Neuroscope, MediFit Instruments, Enfield, Essex, UK). The complementarity of these measures in diabetes are described in detail elsewhere. 18 
 2.1.4 Peripheral neuronal assessment—peripheral nerve function Nerve conduction studies was evaluated by use of standardized neurophysiological testing by trained neurophysiologists, according to American Association of Electrodiagnostic Medicine. 21  Assessments of nerve conduction velocities, amplitudes and F‐waves were performed on the motor nerves (peroneal, tibial and ulnar nerves) and sensory nerves (sural, radial and median). To avoid influence of skin‐temperature on the conduction velocity, appropriate warming measures were used to ensure that the testing room did not allow skin temperatures below 32°C. Spring‐ring electrodes were used to record digital sensory nerve action potential. A plastic bar electrode was used for all other nerves. The results were processed according to reference values accepted by our EMG laboratories. To evaluate the severity of large fibre neuropathy, a composite score consisting of numerical ratings from 5 components of the sural, peroneal and tibial nerve assessment was used (range 0–15), where a total of 3 points indicate DSPN. 22 
 Small fibre neuropathy was measured by a computerized Thermo Tester (TSA II NeuroSensory analyser; Medoc Ltd, Ramat Yishai, Israel). The temperature increased from a baseline of 32°C to a maximum of 52°C with increments of 1°C/s. The thermode was positioned on the skin on the right volar forearm, 10 cm proximal from the wrist. At pain tolerance threshold, the participants were told to press a button and the average of 3 successive stimulations were used for further analysis. Loss of protective sensation was assessed by applying a standardized 26‐g monofilament perpendicular to the plantar side of the first toe and a reference area on the forearm. The size of the monofilament (gram) was noted at the pain detection threshold. If no pain was evoked at the maximum size, 300 g was notified for further calculation. 2.2 Study endpoints The primary endpoint was the change in the early precortical N20 latency of the primary SEP elicited in response to electrical stimuli delivered to the median nerve before and after 26 weeks of placebo‐controlled intervention at the titrated dose. 23  The secondary outcomes were changes in systemic proinflammatory cytokines (IL‐1β, TNF‐α, IL‐6, IL‐8 and IL‐10) and specific macrophage markers (sCD163 and sCD206), subcortical evoked potentials (N14) and late cortical potentials (N60), measures of autonomic function, and standardized neurophysiological testing. Tertiary outcomes were alterations in weight, HbA1c, heart rate, blood pressure and insulin utilization. 2.3 Statistics The sample size was determined according to previously reported electrophysiological latencies from our laboratory. However, these results were not specific to liraglutide‐induced changes. This study was powered to detect a minimal difference of 1.0 standard deviation (SD) between liraglutide and placebo in the N20 latency and amplitude. With 80% power and a 2‐sided significance level of 0.05 the sample size needed to detect this change is 16 in each group or 32 patients in total, assuming a 20% SD in recorded latencies. Factoring in an attrition rate of 25% we set a sample size of 20 patients per group. Patient characteristics are presented as means with SD or as medians with interquartile range (IQR) according to whether data followed the normal distribution or not. Group differences at baseline were assessed by Student  t  test and χ 2  test for categorical variables. Effects of liraglutide versus placebo were modelled by linear regression adjusting for baseline variables of study outcomes. To fulfil the requirement of a normal distribution of the model residuals, outcomes were log‐transformed when applicable. Consequently, estimates for these models are given in percentages. Where outcomes where not log transformed estimates are reported as absolute values. HRV indices were adjusted for resting heart rate at the time of testing. Statistical significance was inferred at a 2‐tailed  P ‐value &lt;.05. Analyses were performed prior to unblinding, using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). 3 RESULTS In total, 602 patients with type 1 diabetes were identified in the electronic patient records; however, 488 did not meet the specific inclusion criteria (Figure  1 ). Figure 1 The consort flow chart shows the progress through this prospective, randomized, double‐blind, parallel‐group, placebo‐controlled trial The study personnel assessed the 114 remaining patients for additional eligibility. Of these, 66 patients were excluded ( n  = 20, did not have abnormal nerve conduction velocities and  n  = 46 declined to participate). Ultimately, 48 patients were randomized, 9 of whom withdrew from the study due to adverse effects (7/9: severe nausea; 5/9: vomiting; 3/9: reflux; 3/9: decreased appetite). In total 19 patients randomized to liraglutide and 20 to placebo completed the trial. Overall, 80% of patients were male, had a mean (SD) age of 50.4 years (8.6), a diabetes duration of 32.4 years (9.3), a HbA1c of 66 mmol/mol (IQR 58–73) ~8.2% (IQR 7.5–8.8) and 35 patients (90%) had orthostatic hypotension. The baseline characteristics of the 2 study groups are shown in Table  1 . No between group differences were identified in the clinical evaluation of severity of DSPN, conduction velocities or amplitudes. Moreover, no differences between groups were shown in baseline characteristics including sex distribution, age, HbA1c, body mass index, diabetes duration, blood pressure, kidney function, cholesterol, smoking habits or use of medication except intermediate‐acting insulin and insulin pump therapy.

Figure 2 Grand mean averages of the cortical evoked potentials from 3 different electrodes, representing the subcortical activation (Oz), the early cortical activation (CP5) and the late cortical activation (C1). It can be seen that there is no difference between liraglutide and placebo in latencies and amplitudes 3.2 Secondary endpoints 3.2.1 Inflammatory profile Liraglutide significantly reduced IL‐6 (−22.6% (95%CI −38.1, −3.2) compared to placebo with a numerical reduction in other proinflammatory cytokines and markers of macrophage function (Figure  3  and Table  2A ). Figure 3 Liraglutide reduced systemic proinflammatory markers, here shown as relative differences in comparison to placebo. The reduction reached significance for interleukin (IL)‐6; however, a similar numerical trend was present for other proinflammatory cytokines, suggesting a potential systemic anti‐inflammatory effect of the glucagon‐like peptide‐1‐agonist. The error bars illustrate the 95% confidence intervals. IFN = interferon; TNF = tumour necrosis factor Table 2A Inflammatory profile Randomization Week 26 group differences

The liraglutide induced in average 3 kg weight loss and reduced urine albumin‐to‐creatinine ratio by 40%. Changes in IL‐6 were interestingly independent of glycaemic control as well as renal function, however associated to the weight loss. No treatment group‐differences with regards to improvement or decline in any electrophysiological measures to assess the neuronal function was shown. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a randomized placebo‐controlled study has shown significant decrease in IL‐6 in response to liraglutide treatment in humans. Although IL‐6 primarily is regarded as a proinflammatory cytokine, its actions are not limited to the immune system and its regenerative properties are increasingly recognized including neuronal differentiation and regeneration, metabolic processes, and liver regeneration. 24  The current findings indicate a GLP‐1‐mediated reduction in macrophage infiltration and inhibition of inflammatory pathways, although it is not clear why there was a preferential effect on IL‐6 rather than other proinflammatory cytokines. It is known that macrophages residing in adipose tissue are the major sources for elevated plasma IL‐6 in obesity, and therefore the observed reduction in IL‐6 seems directly influenced by the weight loss itself. 25  Nevertheless, heightened levels of IL‐6 have been associated with reduced heart rate variability in type 1 diabetes, potentially indicating a specific importance of this cytokine in autonomic neuropathy. 26  Furthermore, elevated levels of IL‐6 have been identified as an independent predictor of type 2 diabetes and associated cardiovascular events. 27 ,  28  In addition, it has recently been suggested that the inflammatory cascade from CRP to IL‐6 provides a novel therapeutic opportunity of atheroprotection by targeting the central IL‐6 signalling system and thus ultimately inhibits the IL‐1β producing inflammasome. 29  Concomitantly with the reduction in IL‐6 were numerical trends present in other cytokines. This is in line with the presence of GLP‐1 receptors demonstrated on monocytes/macrophages and supports the reported 12% reduction of TNF‐α in liraglutide treated patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria. 30  The shown reduction of microalbuminuria in the liraglutide treated group is in accordance with previous data from the larger outcome studies. 31 ,  32  In addition, recent findings advocate that the IL‐6 pathway seems overactive in 40% of type 1 diabetes patients and that this previously has been implicated in the initiation and progression of microalbuminuria. 33  In that context, our data show a concomitantly reduction in IL‐6 and microalbuminuria in type 1 diabetes and confirmed DSPN and thus may contribute to a mechanistic understanding of the liraglutide induced nephroprotection. The pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathies is complex and poorly understood, involving vascular, metabolic, immune‐mediated and inflammatory pathways, which taken together leads to ischaemia, oxidative stress, nonenzymatic glycation of neural structures and heightened inflammatory response. 8  The microglia produces proinflammatory cytokines such as IL‐6 and free radicals, which have been shown to be neurotoxic in e.g. Alzheimer's disease. 34  Furthermore, increased levels of TNF‐α has been correlated to heart rate variability and CAN, 35  and are speculated to play a pathogenic role in the development and maintenance of diabetic neuropathy. 36  It is therefore intriguing to target the anti‐inflammatory component of neurodegeneration, 37  which is emphasized by the promising results in Parkinson's disease, where activation of the GLP‐1 axis led to positive effects on practically defined off‐medication motor scores. 38  The neuronal damage in diabetes is arguably being the final cumulative downstream effect and thus subtle changes in neuronal function may not be detectable with current techniques. To investigate the anti‐inflammatory effect of liraglutide on peripheral and central neuronal function, we used the latency of the primary SEPs to median nerve stimulation—the N20 peak—as the primary outcome, because it the most consistent peak reaching the pre‐cortical level, encompassing neuronal transduction, transmission, neuronal communication and central synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, this peak also shows low latency variability between subjects. In addition, the absence of the N20 component is considered the most reliable indicator of unfavourable prognosis in stroke and post‐cardiopulmonary arrest. To investigate where and when the anti‐inflammatory actions influence the neuronal communication within the neuroaxis, detailed neurophysiological information is needed. However, the data in this study do not support a differentiated interpretation. Given that the severity score ranged from 3–15, we postulate that some of the patients had late‐stage neuropathy characterized by de‐myelinization and axonal loss beyond the point of possible reversibility, which may have hampered the assessment. We cannot explain the over‐representation of men, as the literature report ambiguous results on the influence of sex on development of DSPN 39 ,  40 ; however, the onset of DSPN is earlier in men plausibly due to lifestyle and depletion of androgens, which exerts specific neuroprotective effects. 41 ,  42  Therefore, the skewed sex distribution rather represents selection bias, possibly because men have favoured participating in a resource‐demanding study with many applied technologies. Similarly, liraglutide failed to have any beneficial effect on the secondary outcomes of cardiometrically derived parameters of autonomic function and standardized neurophysiological peripheral nerve testing. Our HRV results repeated after 26 weeks are in contrast to the findings of a previous studies, which demonstrated a reduction in HRV in type 2 diabetic patients treated for 12 weeks with liraglutide. 43  It was proposed that the reduction in HRV was secondary to GLP‐1 receptor activation by liraglutide in the sinoatrial node, resulting in a more chronometric heart rhythm. 43  However, reduced HRV has been shown to be associated with altered central processing within the operculum–insular network, underlining the systemic influence of diabetic neuropathy. 9  This discordance in findings may reflect differences in diabetic disease phenotype and study design. In addition, patient enrolled in the present study may suffer from manifest and irreversible CAN as 35/39 participants were diagnosed with orthostatic hypotension, suggesting co‐existence of severe CAN. This finding is in accordance with a similar trial performed in adults with type 2 diabetes and mild neuropathy. 13  Finally, the tertiary outcomes showed that liraglutide in comparison to placebo induced weight loss, which confirms the drug compliance. Weight loss is considered as anti‐inflammatory in itself, and it has previously been shown that substantially weight reduction in morbidly obese patients induces a significant decrease in IL‐6, whereas TNF‐α remains unaltered. 44  In this study, the average weight loss was only approximately 3 kg; however, this reduction seemed associated with the reduction in IL‐6. The novel aspect of this study was the utilization of a broad range of techniques to evaluate the effect of liraglutide in a multi‐level neurophysiological model. Taken together, liraglutide treatment consistently failed to demonstrate any reversibility or attenuation of progression of polyneuropathy in this cohort but then again, patients were recruited based on severe DSPN, which may not be at a reversible state. There are several limitations to our study. First, the extern validity or generalizability to other phenotypes of diabetes is unclear and with a relatively short intervention of 26 weeks the study design does not allow for differentiating between the drug effect in either the short or long term. Consequently, there is a risk of obscuring a real positive long‐term neuroprotective effect of liraglutide. If that is the case, the conclusion of the paper has major implications, both generally (publication bias in preclinical trials) and specifically on the future studies of diabetic neuropathy. Second, these patients had in average–long duration (&gt;31 years) of diabetes, which was present prior to guidelines advocating for intensive glycaemic control and therefore longstanding and more severe neuropathy may reasonably be expected in this subpopulation. Even though experimental evidence indicates that GLP‐1 agonists may have direct neurotrophic effects, we acknowledge that the design of including adults with established neuropathy, expectedly represents disease progression where neuronal changes are at irreversible state. Third, choice of measuring the  net  neuronal function by the use of SEPs and anticipating a clinical difference of a standard deviation may have opposed our hypothesis, and have obscured a true effect (Type I error). Fourth, this study did not investigate neuroregenerative or neuroprotective response to liraglutide, as for instance investigating thin fibre regeneration, density or morphology in skin biopsies or corneal confocal microscopy. These measures could, however, in contrast to the current study, yield the potential to identify the warranted anti‐inflammatory effect in early stage neuropathy. Fifth, the plasma levels of cytokines are continuously influenced by different cascades of signalling transduction and thus the plasma levels are susceptible to changes in glycaemic control, metabolism and medication. However severe events including major infections and hospitalizations are ruled out due to systematic reports of adverse events. Finally, despite of an overall goal of optimizing treatment, all participants in this study had relatively high levels of HbA1c in both placebo‐ and liraglutide‐treated patients. Such hyperglycaemic levels are, in themselves, proinflammatory and thus could counteract a liraglutide‐induced anti‐inflammatory effect. 5 CONCLUSION Liraglutide reduced IL‐6 but did not improve neuronal function, possibly because the polyneuropathy had reached a point beyond reversibility. Hitherto, diabetic neuropathy has no cure. Thus, speculations can be raised whether mechanism targeted treatment, e.g. lowering the systemic level of proinflammatory cytokines may lead to prevention or treatment of the neuroinflammatory component in early stages of diabetic neuropathy. If ever successful, this would serve as an example of how fundamental mechanistic principles are translated into clinical practice similar to those applied in the cardiovascular and nephrological clinic for the benefit of future patients.

    <Body>What is already known about this subject 
 AJM300 is a novel, orally administrable α4‐integrin antagonist that inhibits leucocyte trafficking into inflamed tissues. The anti‐α4 integrin antibody, natalizumab, has been used to treat patients with multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease. AJM300 has shown a preventative effect on worsening neurological deficits in a rat experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model. 
 What this study adds 
 HCA2969 was found to have a short half‐life of 14.1 h at the 960‐mg dosage. Multiple oral administration of AJM300 at the 960‐mg dosage increased lymphocyte count by 125–170%. This pharmacodynamic effect was sustained over a 24‐h period and is almost comparable to that of natalizumab. 
 1 INTRODUCTION Targeting of immune cell‐trafficking molecules has been a burgeoning area for the development of anti‐inflammatory drugs. Anti‐integrin therapy, which inhibits the extravasation of circulating leucocytes into inflamed tissues, has been used to treat various inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), inflammatory bowel disease, 1 ,  2  asthma and atopic dermatitis. 3  However, approved therapeutics are mostly monoclonal antibodies which are invariably delivered by injection because of their high molecular weight. Immunogenicity, which leads to a decrease in the effectiveness of drugs and an increase in the risk of hypersensitivity reactions due to the development of persistent anti‐drug antibodies, also remains a concern. 1 ,  4 
 A widely used anti‐integrin medication with well‐documented efficacy is  https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=6591 . 5 ,  6 ,  7  It is a humanised monoclonal antibody against the  https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=2443  of  https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=2580  and  https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=2770  integrins on leucocytes, acting as a selective adhesion molecule inhibitor. Natalizumab significantly reduces rate of relapse and progression of disability in patients with relapsing–remitting MS. 8 ,  9 ,  10 ,  11  In patients with Crohn's disease, natalizumab increases rates of clinical remission and response and improves patients' quality of life. 12  However, natalizumab treatment has been associated with a risk of progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML), an opportunistic brain infection caused by reactivated John Cunningham virus. 13  Three risk factors of developing natalizumab‐associated PML are known: the presence of anti‐John Cunningham virus antibodies, previous immunosuppression, and treatment duration, especially beyond 2 years. 14 ,  15 ,  16 
 
 https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=10510  (INN;  https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=10510 ) is a small‐molecule α4‐integrin antagonist that can be administered orally and is almost nonimmunogenic. An orally administered active drug would have the additional advantage of potentially increasing drug adherence. AJM300 is an esterified prodrug that has limited pharmacological action by itself but is specifically designed to enhance oral bioavailability. After absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, the majority of AJM300 is hydrolysed by carboxylesterase 1 to its active metabolite,  https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=105101  in the liver. This HCA2969 should be widely distributed throughout the body, uptaken by hepatic organic anion‐transporting polypeptide 1B1 or 1B3, primarily excreted in bile via transporters such as multidrug resistance‐associated protein 2, minimally reabsorbed into the enterohepatic circulation, and thereby eliminated in faeces (unpublished data on file, EA Pharma Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). It shares the same mechanism of action as natalizumab, inhibiting leucocyte transmigration into inflamed tissue by blocking the interaction of α4β1 or α4β7 integrins and their counter‐receptors ( https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=6758  and  https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=9339 ) and ligand ( https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=6754 ). In a rat experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis—a rodent model of MS—administration of AJM300 prevented worsening of the neurological deficit. The lymphocyte count at trough level in the blood showed a significant increase in rats administered AJM300 compared with the vehicle‐treated group. 17  AJM300 has also entered clinical development for induction therapy of active ulcerative colitis (UC). 18 
 In a previous single‐dose study, we found that a single oral dose of AJM300 is safe and tolerable up to 960 mg. 19  In this phase 1 study, we aimed to assess the safety of AJM300 and HCA2969 and to investigate their pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties after oral multiple dosing of AJM300 3 times daily in healthy male volunteers. 2 METHODS 2.1 Study participants The study population consisted of 23 healthy, non‐smoking, Japanese male subjects aged 20–39 years, with a body mass index ≥18.5 and &lt;25.0 kg m −2 . Eligible subjects had normal vital signs, laboratory tests and electrocardiogram (ECG), had no clinically significant medical history and were taking no medication or supplements that would interfere with the procedures or compromise subject safety. Subjects were ineligible if their white blood cell (WBC) count was &lt;4.0 × 10 3 /μL and/or they were seropositive for anti‐HTLV‐1 antibody. Other exclusion criteria included neurological symptoms and serious infectious diseases, including opportunistic infection within 1 year before administration of the drug. All subjects provided written informed consent prior to study enrolment. The study was approved by the local institutional review board (CPC2007–23, at CPC Clinic ethics committee, Kagoshima, Japan) and was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. 2.2 Study design This was a single‐centre, randomised, placebo‐controlled, double‐blind study conducted at the CPC clinic between June and August 2008. Eligible subjects were admitted to the study centre according to the dose groups. One subject who was allocated to the 480‐mg dose (or placebo) group was excluded due to not meeting the criteria (WBC count increased) on the first day of drug administration (Day 1). Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either the active drug (240 mg,  n  = 6; 480 mg,  n  = 5; 960 mg, n = 6) or a corresponding placebo ( n  = 2 per group) as described in Figure  1  and Figure  S1 . Subjects received the study drug orally 3 times daily after each meal on Day 1 followed by a 4‐day washout (observation) period. Thereafter, they took multiple doses of the study drug for 6 consecutive days according to the investigator's safety evaluation. The washout period was not only for safety purposes, but also to observe the PK properties of AJM300 after each meal as a previous single dose and food effect study suggested that absorption of AJM300 could be affected by food consumption (Fukase  et al . 2019. manuscript in preparation). The 240‐mg, 480‐mg and corresponding placebo administration were performed in parallel, and the subsequent 960‐mg administration was determined based on the investigator's safety evaluation. Figure 1 Study design. All subjects were admitted to the trial centre from day −2 (evening) until day 13 (morning). The orange arrow indicates 3 times daily administration of the study drug. Administration of 240 and 480 mg of the study drug was conducted in parallel. The blue arrow indicates a safety examination performed to determine the further progress of the study The subjects were randomised by using a permuted block method. Blinding was achieved by providing a placebo tablet identical to the AJM300 tablet in both appearance and weight. Subjects, investigators and data analysts were masked to treatment allocation. All subjects were housed at the study centre on Day −2 for baseline assessments, discharged on Day 13 and visited the study centre for follow‐up examinations on Day 17. All food and drink provided at the study centre were standard meals (approx. energy, 2000 kcal; protein, 80 g; fat, 54 g; carbohydrate, 290 g; sodium, 8 g per day), no special dietary meal was provided and any other food or drink (alcohol, caffeine and grapefruit‐containing products in particular) were not permitted during admission. Subjects were required to finish their meals 30 min before dosing and were not allowed to take any additional food or drink other than water until 4 h postdose. They were also not allowed to lie down for at least 2 h after dosing. 2.3 Sample collection and analytical methods For the quantification of plasma AJM300 and HCA2969 concentrations, 2‐mL venous blood samples were collected from an intravenous cannula at the following timing points after the first dose: −0.5, 0.5, 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5 and 4 h and every hour thereafter until 15 and 21 h (on Days 1, 8 and 10); −0.5 h (on Days 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 13); −0.5 and 11 h (on Days 11 and 12). For the WBC count and differential, 2‐mL venous blood samples were collected at the following timing points after the first dose: −0.5 h (from Day −1 to Day 13 except for Day 4); 0.5, 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5 and 4 h and every hour thereafter until 15 and 21 h (on Days −1, 1, 8 and 10); 11 h (on Days 11 and 12). Urine samples were collected at predose and 0–5, 5–11, 11–16 and 16–24 (until the next day's administration) h after the first dose on Days 1, 7 and 9, and the samples were stored at ≤−20°C under acidic conditions (pH 3.0) in 5% 1 M sodium dihydrogen phosphate buffer until analysis. Plasma and urinary concentrations of AJM300 and HCA2969 were measured using a liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) assay at Toray Research Center, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). The method was developed and validated according to the recommendations of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guideline on bioanalytical method validation guidance for industry. 20  The analytical range was linear with a 1/x 2  weighting between 0.5 and 500 ng mL –1  for plasma analyte (AJM300 and HCA2969) concentrations, and between 2.11 and 526 ng mL –1  for urinary analyte concentrations based on an  r  value ≥0.998. Inter‐day and intra‐assay accuracy for plasma concentrations with low (1 ng mL –1 ), medium (10 ng mL –1 ) and high (400 ng mL –1 ) quality control samples were 107.0–114.0% for AJM300 and 103.7–113.9% for HCA2969, and the precision (% coefficient of variation) was ≤2.5% for AJM300 and ≤ 5.4% for HCA2969. 2.4 PK assessments PK parameters were analysed by non‐compartmental methods using WinNonlin Professional Version 5.0.1 (Pharsight Corporation, St. Louis, MO, USA), and the following parameters were included: peak plasma concentration from zero to 24 h (C max 24h ); the time to reach C max 24h  (T max 24h ); trough plasma concentration (C trough ) which was obtained as a minimum plasma concentration just before the first dose on the next day (24 h after the initial dose); the area under the concentration–time curve from zero to 24 h (AUC 24h ) which was estimated via the linear trapezoidal rule; the apparent terminal elimination half‐life (t 1/2 ); the cumulative fraction of the dose excreted in the urine over each collection interval (fe). 2.5 Statistical analyses Descriptive statistics were provided for all PK, PD, demographic and safety parameters. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS 8.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Tokyo, Japan) at BELLSYSTEM24, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). Statistical tests for significance were 2‐sided, and the significance level was set at α = 0.05. A natural logarithmic transformation of PK parameters, except for T max  and fe, was applied for all statistical inference. The PK dose‐proportionality with regard to C max , AUC 24h  was assessed using a power model, and it was considered to have been demonstrated if the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were within the 0.7–1.3 window. 21  The variability of median T max  was assessed using a Kruskal–Wallis test. For the PD analyses, considering the daily fluctuation of biomarkers, the total WBC and differential counts at baseline (Day −1) were measured at the same timing points for plasma concentrations measured on Day 1. We first analysed the changes in the PD markers (i.e. lymphocyte count) from baseline value as well as the percentage change from baseline. The percentage change was calculated using the following equation:
 percentage change % = Cell count on Day X − Cell count on Day − 1 Cell count on Day − 1 . where X = the day after dosing of AJM300. Secondly, we estimated 3 area under the effect curves (AUECs) where the percentage change in the lymphocyte count were ≥ 0%, ≥30% and ≥ 50% at each dosage. The statistical significance of the change in the PD markers between AJM300 and placebo was assessed using a  t ‐test. In addition, a planned orthogonal comparison was performed using a maximum contrast method 22  with 5 sets of polynomial contrast coefficients as described Table  S3B . The strength of the relationship described as  η 
 2  and the  P  value were calculated to evaluate the polynomial trends (upper bound, half up, linear, half down, lower bound) for the dose–response to the AUEC of the percentage change in the lymphocyte count. Safety was assessed by monitoring the type, severity and incidence of adverse events (AEs) and by evaluation of standard clinical laboratory parameters, physical and neurological symptoms, and ECG. Clinical safety was addressed by evaluating the number/proportion of subjects experiencing AEs and by investigating any clinically significant changes from baseline in laboratory tests, vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, body temperature and weight) and ECG. The AEs were classified as mild, moderate or severe, and the relationship to the study drug was judged by the investigator. 2.6 Nomenclature of targets and ligands Key protein targets and ligands in this article are hyperlinked to corresponding entries in  http://www.guidetopharmacology.org , the common portal fordata from the IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY. 3 RESULTS 3.1 Subjects Of the 78 subjects enrolled, 23 eligible subjects were randomised, and all of them completed the study. No subject was withdrawn; hence, all 23 subjects were included in the PK, PD and safety analyses. Baseline demographics were generally similar across all treatment groups (mean ± standard deviation); age (24.3 ± 3.7), height (171.5 ± 7.3), weight (64.3 ± 6.8) and body mass index (21.8 ± 1.8). The complete CONSORT flow chart and baseline demographics are shown in Figure  S1  and Table  S1  of the online supporting documents. 3.2 PK The main PK parameters and the concentration–time profiles of AJM300 and its active metabolite, HCA2969 on Day 1 and Day 10 (the last of 6 consecutive days of administration) are summarised in Table  1  and Figure  2 . While the concentration–time profiles of both AJM300 and HCA2969 displayed a similar triphasic pattern after 3 times daily administration on Day 1 and Day 10, the systemic exposure based on AUC 24h  was much higher to HCA2969 than to AJM300 (Figure  2 ). For example, HCA2969 AUC 24h  was 6.34‐fold higher than AJM300 AUC 24h  at the 960‐mg dosage on Day 10. The mean t 1/2  of AJM300 and HCA2969 at the 960‐mg dosage on Day 10 was 5.60 and 14.07 h, respectively. Both AJM300 and HCA2969 concentrations declined soon after the last dose. Particularly, the plasma AJM300 concentration reached the lower limit of quantification within 37 h on Day 10 after the last 960‐mg dose of AJM300. The fe of AJM300 and HCA2969 after 960 mg of AJM300 administration on Day 9 were 0.001 and 0.537%, respectively; both the parent compound and its metabolite were excreted at very low levels in the urine. Plasma AJM300 and HCA2969 trough concentrations were stable from Day 6 at all dosages tested and reached steady state on the second day of consecutive administration (Figure  3 ).

Data are presented as the logarithmic mean (+ standard deviation) of the concentration.

Light orange arrows indicate the time of drug administration (0, 5 and 11 h) Figure 3 AJM300 (top) and HCA2969 (bottom) trough concentration. Both AJM300 and HCA2969 trough concentrations were stable from day 6 and reached steady state on day 7. Note that HCA2969 trough concentration at the 960‐mg dosage was over IC50 (a half maximal inhibitory concentration; 170 ng mL −1 ) at all observation days except for day 11. Data are presented as mean + standard deviation No dose proportionality was concluded with regard to C max  and AUC 24h  of HCA2969 on Day 10 in the 960‐mg dosage group because the mean slopes of the linear regression were both 0.678 using a power model analysis, and the 95% CIs were outside the predefined window (Table  S2 ). However, the ratio of the 480‐mg to 240‐mg dosage for HCA2969 C max  was 2.1; the ratio of 960‐mg to 480‐mg dosage was 1.3. Similarly, the ratio of 480‐mg to 240‐mg dosage for HCA2969 AUC 24h  was 2.3; the ratio of 960‐mg to 480‐mg dosage was 1.1. Hence, dose proportionality for C max  and AUC 24h  of HCA2969 up to 480 mg was indicated. No apparent difference with regards to T max  among dosage groups was confirmed (data not shown). 3.3 PD The daily fluctuation of WBC and differential counts showed great inter‐subject variability in which no specific trends were observed (data not shown). The total WBC counts were increased after administration of AJM300 across all dosage groups; however, no change in the neutrophil count was observed. This was because resting neutrophil lacks α4‐integrin subunits. 23 ,  24  Under normal conditions, α4β1 integrin is expressed at substantial levels on most mononuclear leucocytes. 25 ,  26  Both α4β1 and α4β7 integrins are expressed at moderate levels on most of naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells 27  as well as on most resting B cells in peripheral blood 28 ; thus, an increase in the lymphocyte count that was remarkable but clinically within the normal range was observed after administration of AJM300 on both Day 1 and Day 10 (Figure  4 ). This pharmacological effect was consistent with results obtained for another α4‐integrin inhibitor, natalizumab. 12  The noticeable finding was a 50.58% increase in lymphocyte count at the first 960 mg dose on Day 10. A sustained increase of 25.18–72.30% from the baseline was elicited following 3 times daily doses of 960 mg on Day 10. The significant increases observed on Day 10 returned to baseline levels 13 h after the last 240‐mg and 480‐mg doses, and 24 h after the last 960‐mg dose. The AUECs where the percentage change in the lymphocyte count from baseline was ≥0%, ≥30% and ≥ 50% at each dosage on Day 1 and Day 10 is shown in Figure  S2 . The strongest relationship between the linear trend (contrast coefficient: −3, −1, 1, 3) and the dose–response curve was concluded when the mean AUECs in which the lymphocyte count increased ≥30% and ≥ 50% on Day 10 was compared to each dose. The  η 
 2  describing the strength of the relationship was 97.8% for a 30% increase and 96.4% for a 50% increase (Table  S3B ). Figure 4 Significant increase in the lymphocyte counts in the peripheral blood following administration of AJM300 on day 1 and day 10. Note that the significant increase was sustained at the 960‐mg dosage until 13 h after the last dose (24 h on graph;  P  = .014 compared to placebo) but no significance was confirmed 24 h after the last dose (35 h on the graph;  P  = .399 compared with placebo) on day 10. Data are presented as the proportion of the mean (+standard deviation) change from baseline in the lymphocyte counts. Light orange arrows indicate the time of drug administration (0, 5 and 11 h) The mean percentage change in lymphocyte count at C trough  on Day 10 was 1.03, −6.53, 6.27 and 50.58% in the placebo, 240‐, 480‐ and 960‐mg dosage groups, respectively. 3.4 Safety and tolerability No subject experienced PML, serious AE or an AE that led to treatment discontinuation. A total of 6 (26.1%) subjects reported ≥1 AE after administration of AJM300. The number (percentage) of subjects who reported ≥1 AE was 1 (16.7%), 2 (33.3%), 1 (20.0%) and 2 (33.3%) in the placebo, 240‐, 480‐ and 960‐mg dosage groups, respectively, and at least 1 treatment‐related AE (adverse drug reaction) was reported by 1 (16.7%), 1 (16.7%), 1 (20.0%) and 0 (0.0%) subject, respectively. Observed AEs were all mild in severity, transient and resolved spontaneously. No relevant differences in the incidence or severity of AEs were identified among treatment groups (Table  2 ).

The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Affairs (MedDRA) was used to code the adverse events of the trial. 4 DISCUSSION The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the PK, PD properties, and safety of AJM300 and its active metabolite, HCA2969—a novel α4‐integrin antagonist—after oral administration of 240, 480 and 960 mg of AJM300 in healthy male subjects. The results of PD assessments provided supporting evidence that 960 mg administered orally 3 times daily is essential to sustain an increase in circulating lymphocytes over a 24‐h period. This study also revealed that multiple administration of AJM300 3 times daily is safe and tolerable up to 960 mg. Following 3 times daily administration, the plasma HCA2969 concentration was much higher than the AJM300 concentration at each dosage, whilst the triphasic pattern was maintained, which suggested that most of the parent drug (AJM300) was hydrolysed to the active metabolite (HCA2969) after absorption. In addition, the finding that AJM300 was scarcely excreted in urine as unchanged (0.001% on Day 9 after doses of 960 mg) indicated that metabolism is a primary elimination route of AJM300. This was also verified by a previous animal experiment in which  14 C‐labelled AJM300 was hardly excreted in urine, bile or faeces. Following intravenous administration of a single dose of  14 C‐AJM300 (3 mg/kg) in rats, the cumulative excretion of radioactivity as unchanged from time zero to 72 h was detectable in neither faeces nor urine of the animals administered the  14 C‐dose, whereas cumulative recovery of  14 C‐HCA2969 was 87.3% in faeces but not detectable in urine (unpublished data on file, EA Pharma Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Comparably, a limited amount (0.537%) of HCA2969 was excreted in urine in this human study. This minimal excretion in urine corroborates the observation that HCA2969 is primarily eliminated via the biliary route. The AJM300 T max  was generally not rapid, 3–4.5 h after each drug administration, and appeared to be prolonged after a meal (e.g. the median T max 5h , T max 5–11h  and T max 11–24h  were 3.75, 9.50 and 15.00 h, respectively at the 960‐mg dosage on Day 10). Given that subjects took meals about 1 h before each administration of AJM300, it is very likely that food consumption interfered with the absorption of AJM300. The AJM300 and HCA2969 C trough  reached a steady state on the second consecutive day of administration (Day 6), which indicated the absence of drug accumulation, and greater exposure was observed with a higher dosage. The power model concluded that there was no dose‐proportionality with regards to C max  and AUC 24h  of HCA2969 across dosages tested. The absence of dose‐proportionality among the 3 dosages can be explained by the comparison between 2 dosages with the ratio of these PK parameters, which indicated that C max  and AUC 24h  would reach a plateau at the 480‐mg dosage. Nevertheless, it should be emphasised that C trough  on Day 10 at the 960‐mg dosage, which far exceeded those of the 240‐ or 480‐mg dosages, is of the utmost importance for the PD effects that lead to clinical efficacy. AJM300, an oral form of the anti‐integrin drug, was developed as a safe alternative to currently available anti‐α4 integrin antibodies such as natalizumab whilst providing comparative PD effects. Natalizumab has been shown to be effective at reducing brain inflammation in MS patients by preventing activated leucocytes from accessing the brain parenchyma. In a clinical study on Crohn's disease, natalizumab elicited a 1.3–1.9‐fold increase in the lymphocyte count from baseline. 12  In our multiple dose study, administration of 960 mg of AJM300 3 times daily was able to prompt a 24‐h sustained increase of circulating lymphocytes in the range of 1.25–1.7‐fold. Hence, AJM300 at the 960‐mg dosage appears to have a PD effect almost comparable to that of natalizumab. In a CytoTox 96 Non‐Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay using Jurkat cells expressing human α4β1 integrins, we found that HCA2969 inhibited the binding of VCAM‐1 to α4β1 integrin subunit under the human serum condition with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of 170 ng mL −1  (unpublished data on file, EA Pharma Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). In this study, only a 960 mg dosage regimen was able to achieve this IC 50  level at steady state (refer to Table  1  HCA2969 C trough  and Figure  3 ). A comparison using the maximum contrast method concluded the linear trend of the dose response to the mean AUECs where the increase in lymphocyte count was ≥30% and ≥ 50% on Day 10, indicating that 960‐mg dosage should ensure a maximal PD effect. Furthermore, at the 960‐mg dosage, the mean percentage change in the lymphocyte count at C trough  on Day 10 was much higher compared with other dosages (51%  vs  −7–6%), implicating a sustained PD effect induced by multiple dosing of 960 mg. These results suggested that a sustainable IC 50  or greater obtained at the 960‐mg dosage would be crucial to acquire clinical efficacy dependent on the PD effect. We also believe that the sustained PD effect shown at the C trough  at the 960‐mg dosage in this study indicates clinical efficacy in phase 2 clinical trials in patients with active UC at the 960‐mg dosage 18  but not at 480 mg (unpublished data on file, EA Pharma Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) Multiple doses of AJM300 up to 960 mg 3 times daily for 6 days in healthy male subjects were safe and well tolerated. All AEs reported were mild, and no serious AE or PML was identified. To date, there has been no reported case of PML after treatment with AJM300 in clinical trials. 18  One of the reasons could be the short‐term treatment used for UC in order to avoid the occurrence of PML. It is unknown whether long‐term treatment with AJM300 is associated with a risk of PML. Natalizumab has a long elimination half‐life (249 ± 105 h [mean ± standard deviation] following a single 300‐mg fixed‐dose infusion 29 ), which may require plasma exchange or immunoadsorption for its removal. 30 ,  31  However, AJM300, which has a much shorter elimination half‐life (AJM300, 5.6 h; HCA2969, 14.1 h at 960‐mg dosage) and a shorter PD effect up to 24 h after the last dose, may make it a more favourable treatment option when considering serious side effects, including PML. Based on credible evidence, AJM300 has entered further clinical development as an induction therapy for active UC. In a phase 2 randomised controlled trial, oral administration of 960 mg of AJM300 3 times daily for 8 weeks was found to be safe and effective in terms of clinical response, clinical remission, and mucosal healing in 102 patients with moderately active UC. 18 
 The limitation of this study is the small sample size (5–6 subjects per arm) used to evaluate the pharmacological action and safety of AJM300. Nevertheless, this study was conducted in a well‐controlled, in‐house setting; therefore, the results of PK and PD studies should be more accurate than studies conducted in an out‐patient setting. A larger scaled, longer‐term phase 3 study with a 960 mg dosage in patients with active UC is currently ongoing to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AJM300 ( http://ClinicalTrials.gov  Identifier: NCT03531892). In conclusion, this study demonstrated that oral administration of AJM300 of 960 mg 3 times daily provided a sustained, maximal PD effect which was represented as an increase in circulating lymphocytes. The percentage change in the lymphocyte count after AJM300 dosing was almost comparable to that observed with natalizumab. AJM300 has the advantage of minimal immunogenicity and hyper‐sensitive reactions as well as better drug adherence. The short elimination half‐life of AJM300 enables control of the duration of pharmacological action followed by cessation. Three times daily administration of AJM300 up to 960 mg for 6 days in healthy male subjects was found to be safe and well tolerated.

    <Body>1 What is already known about this subject 
 Esaxerenone, a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor blocker, has demonstrated clinical efficacy and safety in the treatment of hypertension. Esaxerenone is eliminated via multiple pathways, including oxidation, glucuronidation and hydrolysis. The contribution of CYP3A‐mediated oxidation to esaxerenone clearance is approximately 30%, as indicated by the excretion ratio of oxidised metabolites into urine and faeces. 
 What this study adds 
 Itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increased esaxerenone AUC inf  by approximately 1.5‐fold, compared with administration of esaxerenone alone, which was caused by inhibition of oxidative metabolism of esaxerenone. Rifampicin, a strong CYP3A inducer, reduced esaxerenone AUC inf  by approximately 0.3‐fold, compared with administration of esaxerenone alone, which was caused by induction of oxidative metabolism and glucuronidation of esaxerenone. These results suggest that caution is recommended when esaxerenone is coadministered with a strong inhibitor or inducer of CYP3A in patients with hypertension. 
 1 INTRODUCTION 
 Esaxerenone  (CS‐3150) is a nonsteroidal  mineralocorticoid receptor  (MR) blocker approved for the treatment of hypertension and in development for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy in Japan. Results from an  in vitro  study showed that esaxerenone possesses a favourable pharmacological profile relative to other MR blockers such as  spironolactone  and  eplerenone . 
 1 
  The MR affinity of esaxerenone is 4‐ and 76‐fold greater than that of eplerenone and spironolactone, respectively. 
 1 
  The half‐maximal inhibitory concentration of esaxerenone for the transcriptional activity of human MR is 3.7 nM, and its potency was superior to that of spironolactone and eplerenone, whose half‐maximal inhibitory concentrations were 66 and 970 nM, respectively. 
 1 
  The clinical efficacy of esaxerenone for essential hypertension was demonstrated in a recent double‐blind phase 3 study, 
 2 
  in which esaxerenone 2.5 mg d −1  was shown to be noninferior to eplerenone 50 mg d −1 ; furthermore, the esaxerenone 5 mg d −1  dosage was superior to the 2.5 mg d −1  dosage. 
 2 
  Both dosages of esaxerenone demonstrated efficacy in lowering blood pressure (BP) and were well tolerated. 
 2 
 
 We have already characterised the pharmacokinetics (PK) of esaxerenone in several studies. 
 3 
 ,  
 4 
  Esaxerenone has shown dose‐proportionality after administration of single and multiple doses (5–200 mg in the single‐dose study and 10–100 mg d −1  in the multiple‐dose study) to healthy Japanese adult males with its time to reach maximum plasma concentration and terminal elimination half‐life remaining relatively unchanged across the dose ranges of 2.5 to 3.5 hours and 18.7 to 22.9 hours, respectively. 
 3 
  Esaxerenone has a high absolute bioavailability of approximately 90%. 
 4 
 
 Based on a mass balance study in healthy volunteers, most of the radioactivity of  14 C‐labelled esaxerenone was excreted as metabolites in faeces and urine, with proportions of unchanged drug of 18.7 and 1.6%, respectively. 
 5 
  Thus, the main elimination route of esaxerenone is via metabolism, and it has been suggested that oxidation, glucuronic acid conjugation and hydrolysis are involved. 
 5 
  Esaxerenone metabolites include oxidised metabolite (M1),  O ‐glucuronide conjugate (M4) and acyl‐glucuronide (M11), which are formed by cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A), 5′‐diphospho‐glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and hydrolysis followed by glucuronidation, respectively. 
 In vitro  metabolism studies using human liver microsomes and a human CYP expression system showed that  CYP3A4  and CYP3A5 are involved in the oxidative metabolism of esaxerenone and no metabolites are produced by other major P450 isoforms. 
 5 
  Based on metabolite profiles in faeces and urine, it was estimated that the overall excretion rate of oxidised metabolites, the production of which is catalysed by CYP3A, was about 30% of the total dose. 
 5 
  Additionally, esaxerenone is a substrate of P‐glycoprotein (P‐gp) and breast cancer resistance protein  in vitro , 
 5 
  but given an absolute bioavailability of approximately 90%, 
 4 
  these transporters do not appear to play an important role in esaxerenone absorption. Consequently, the effect of concomitant administration of P‐gp modulators on esaxerenone PK is likely to be limited. However, there is potential for esaxerenone exposure to vary when coadministered with inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A, as about 1/3 of the clearance of esaxerenone appears to be through oxidative metabolism by CYP3A. The MR blocker eplerenone is mainly metabolised via the CYP3A4 pathway, and it has been reported that inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as ketoconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir, verapamil and fluconazole, can cause 2‐ to 5‐fold increases in eplerenone drug exposure. 
 6 
  Concomitant use of eplerenone with strong CYP3A inhibitors, such as itraconazole, is therefore contraindicated, and dose adjustment is necessary when moderate CYP3A inhibitors are coadministered with eplerenone.

 Thus, it is important to evaluate the effects of CYP3A inhibitors and inducers on the PK of the novel MR blocker esaxerenone. Itraconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A, and  rifampicin , a strong inducer of CYP3A, are agents often used in drug–drug interaction (DDI) studies. Thus, expanding on our previously published PK studies,

  this paper reports the results of 2 esaxerenone DDI studies conducted in healthy Japanese subjects: Study 1 investigated the effect of multiple doses of itraconazole on esaxerenone PK following a single dose; and Study 2 investigated the effect of multiple doses of rifampicin on esaxerenone PK following a single dose. Given that rifampicin has the ability to induce not only CYP3A, but also UGT, the plasma concentrations of esaxerenone metabolites—M1, M4 and M11—were also evaluated in Study 2. 2 METHODS 2.1 Study design and treatments Studies 1 and 2 were both single‐centre, open‐label, single‐sequence, crossover studies. Both studies received institutional review board approval (Hakata Clinic Institutional Review Board: Study 1: 1464P1CP‐2, Study 2: 1464P3CP‐5), and all individuals provided written informed consent to participate. All procedures were carried out in accordance with ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. 2.1.1 Study 1 Period 1 (Days 1–7) comprised the esaxerenone alone, single‐dose administration phase of the study. A single esaxerenone 2.5 mg tablet (Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was administered orally on Day 1 (start of Period 1), in the fasting state (fasting for ≥10 h before and 4 h after administration; Figure  1 ), after which subjects rested in a sitting position for 4 hours. The esaxerenone tablet was administered with 200 mL water; no other beverage consumption was permitted for 1 hour before or 2 hours after study drug administration. Caffeinated drinks were prohibited during the hospitalisation period, and the only food permitted was prepared by the study centre and provided at predetermined times. FIGURE 1 Study designs:  a 2.5 mg esaxerenone was administered in a fasting state concomitantly with itraconazole;  b 5 mg esaxerenone was administered in a fasting state 2 hours after rifampicin administration Period 2 (Days 8–17) comprised the coadministration phase of the study, commencing 7 days after the first dose of esaxerenone. On Day 8, 200‐mg oral itraconazole tablets (ITRIZOLE Capsules 50; Janssen Pharmaceutical KK, Tokyo, Japan) were administered twice daily with 200 mL of water: 1 dose 30 minutes after breakfast and another 30 minutes after dinner. Breakfast and dinner consisted of 500–600 kcal of total energy, of which fat accounted for 20–30%, and each meal was consumed within 20 minutes. On Days 9–16, a 200–mg itraconazole tablet was administered once daily 30 minutes after breakfast. On Day 13, a single 2.5‐mg dose of esaxerenone was administered with a 200‐mg itraconazole tablet in the fasting state as previously described (Figure  1 ). A final follow‐up visit occurred on Days 29–31. 2.1.2 Study 2 A similar 2‐period study design was implemented for Study 2, with an esaxerenone single dose administered at the beginning of Period 1 (Days 1–7) and esaxerenone plus rifampicin coadministered during Period 2 (Days 8–17). In Period 1, esaxerenone 5 mg was administered orally on Day 1 (Figure  1 ), following the same food and beverage conditions as described for Study 1. During Period 2 (starting on Day 8), 600 mg rifampicin (RIFADIN Capsules; Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was administered orally with 200 mL of water once daily before breakfast for 9 days. On Day 13, a single oral dose of 5 mg esaxerenone was administered in a fasted state 2 hours after administration of 600 mg rifampicin (Figure  1 ). A final follow‐up visit occurred on Days 29–31. 2.2 Study population Inclusion criteria for the 2 studies were identical: healthy Japanese males aged 20–45 years; body mass index (BMI) ≥18.5 kg m −2  and &lt;25.0 kg m −2 ; BP &lt;140/90 mmHg; and heart rate ≤99 beats min −1 . Key exclusion criteria for both studies were: a history of serious conditions, including central nervous system, cardiovascular, respiratory, blood, gastrointestinal, hepatic/renal, thyroid, pituitary gland or adrenal diseases; any drug hypersensitivity; drug or alcohol dependence; and a positive hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C virus antibody, syphilis or HIV antibody test result. Subjects were also excluded if they had undergone whole blood collection of ≥1200 mL within 1 year, ≥400 mL within 84 days or ≥200 mL within 28 days before screening, or plasmapheresis or platelet apheresis within 14 days before screening. Exclusion criteria also comprised any symptom considered clinically significant by the investigator or subinvestigator, or any abnormal electrocardiograph finding at screening, or a deviation in laboratory data from the reference range of the study centre at screening. Drugs, food or supplements containing St John's Wort, concomitant therapies, the consumption of grapefruit (juice or pulp) within 7 days before admission, and any medical treatment from another physician since the screening examination, were prohibited. 2.3 PK assessments 2.3.1 Blood sampling for PK assays In Study 1, blood samples (3 mL) were collected to measure the plasma concentrations of esaxerenone on Day 1 (Period 1) and Day 13 (Period 2). Samples were collected predose and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72 and 96 hours after esaxerenone administration. In Study 2, blood samples (8 mL) were collected to measure plasma concentrations of esaxerenone and its metabolites on Day 1 (Period 1) and Day 13 (Period 2). As in Study 1, samples were collected predose and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 and 96 hours after esaxerenone administration. Plasma for assays of esaxerenone and its metabolites was obtained by centrifugation (1700  g  for 10 minutes at 4°C) and was frozen (−20°C or lower) until the assays were performed. 2.3.2 Plasma assay Plasma samples were treated by solid phase extraction (Oasis HLB μElution Plate; Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA), and drug concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. 2.3.3 Esaxerenone and its oxidised metabolite (M1) The methodology for chromatographic separation and determination for esaxerenone has been reported previously.

  Multiple‐reaction monitoring of the esaxerenone metabolite M1 (m/z 421 to 224) and its internal standard (d3‐M1, m/z 424 to 24) were conducted. For M1 test samples of 0.3, 4.0 and 80.0 ng mL −1 , intrastudy assay precisions were 2.2, 3.2 and 2.6%, respectively; the assay accuracy ranged from −2.8 to 6.3% (lower limit of quantification [LLOQ] 0.1 ng mL −1 ). 2.3.4 Esaxerenone metabolites: M4 and M11 Chromatographic separation was performed using a CAPCELL PAK C18 MGII column (Shiseido Co., Ltd.; Tokyo, Japan) with an internal diameter of 2.0 mm, length of 150 mm and pore size of 3 μm. Detection was performed using an API 5000 tandem mass spectrometer with TurboIonSpray source by electrospray ionisation in the negative ion mode; multiple‐reaction monitoring of M4 (m/z 641 to 447), M11 (m/z 488 to 312) and their internal standard (d7‐esaxerenone, m/z 472 to 370) was conducted. For M4 test samples of 0.1, 0.3, 4.0 and 80.0 ng mL −1 , intrastudy assay precisions were 2.9–6.3, 4.8–7.1, 1.0–6.5 and 2.5–6.6%, respectively; the assay accuracy ranged from −3.9 to 8.0% (LLOQ 0.1 ng mL −1 ). For M11 test samples of 0.1, 0.3, 4.0 and 80.0 ng mL −1 , intrastudy assay precisions were 3.8–6.7, 2.4–4.6, 1.6–4.1 and 2.3–7.6%, respectively; the assay accuracy ranged from −13.5 to 5.0% (LLOQ 0.1 ng mL −1 ). 2.3.5 PK analysis PK parameters were calculated using noncompartmental analysis, using Phoenix WinNonlin (version 6.3; Certara, Princeton, NJ, USA). For Studies 1 and 2, the primary endpoints were maximum plasma concentration (C max ), area under the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC) to the last quantifiable time (AUC last ) and AUC from time zero to infinity (AUC inf ) for esaxerenone. Secondary endpoints in both studies included time to maximum esaxerenone concentration (t max ), esaxerenone half‐life (t 1/2 ) and apparent total body clearance (CL/F). Study 2 also assessed C max , AUC last  and AUC inf  for esaxerenone metabolites, and ratios of plasma metabolites to parent (esaxerenone; M/P) for C max , AUC last  and AUC inf , which were adjusted to accommodate differences in molecular weight between esaxerenone and its metabolites. 2.4 Safety and tolerability Safety was evaluated through the assessment of adverse events (AEs), laboratory tests, vital signs (BP, pulse rate and body temperature) and 12‐lead electrocardiogram. AEs were coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA/J versions 19.0 and 19.1) System Organ Class and Preferred Terms. 2.5 Sample size The sample sizes for both studies were calculated assuming within‐subject variations in C max  and AUC of 20 and 10%, respectively, based on a previous study.

 For Study 1, assuming that geometric least‐squares mean (GLSM) ratios of C max  and AUC were ≤1.05, when ratios were estimated after a single oral dose of esaxerenone and concomitant itraconazole administration, a sample size of 18 subjects would provide ≥80% statistical power with 2‐sided 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for GLSM ratios of C max  and AUC to detect the CIs within 0.80–1.25. To allow for unexpected circumstances, such as subject withdrawals, the number of subjects was specified as 20. For Study 2, it was estimated that 12 subjects would be required. Two‐sided 90% CIs of GLSM ratios of C max  and AUC, when ratios were estimated after a single oral dose of esaxerenone and concomitant rifampicin administration, were assumed to be 0.2–1.0 based on a case series of 12 subjects (unpublished data on file, Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd.). The estimation accuracy for GLSM ratios was within about 10% in all cases, indicating sufficient accuracy for assessing DDIs. 2.6 Statistical analyses In all studies, the PK analysis sets included subjects who received esaxerenone, and for whom data were available for at least 1 primary endpoint in Periods 1 and 2. The safety analysis sets included all subjects who agreed to participate in the study and who received at least 1 dose of esaxerenone, itraconazole or rifampicin. Differences between the results when esaxerenone was administered alone or with itraconazole or rifampicin, were calculated using GLSM ratios and their 90% CIs. If the GLSM ratio was contained within the bounds (0.80–1.25) of the 90% CIs, it was inferred that there was no DDI. For all statistical analyses, SAS software (version 9.2; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) was used. 2.7 Nomenclature of targets and ligands Key protein targets and ligands in this article are hyperlinked to corresponding entries in  http://www.guidetopharmacology.org , the common portal for data from the IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY. 3 RESULTS 3.1 Baseline characteristics A total of 20 subjects were enrolled in, and completed, Study 1.

A total of 12 subjects were enrolled in Study 2; 1 subject was withdrawn because of an AE (rash) and was not included in the analysis. The mean (SD) age was 31.9 (8.12) years, height was 169 (6.48) cm and BMI was 22.3 (1.31) kg m −2  (Table  1 ). 3.2 Effects of itraconazole on esaxerenone PK (Study 1) The plasma concentration–time profile for esaxerenone is shown in Figure  2a . A slight increase in C max  was observed when esaxerenone was coadministered with itraconazole (mean [SD], 41.7 [8.46] ng mL −1 ) compared with esaxerenone alone (36.7 [5.36] ng mL −1 ). However, mean values for AUC last  and AUC inf  were approximately 50% greater with coadministration  vs  esaxerenone alone (AUC last  920 [186]  vs  625 [113] ng h mL −1 ; AUC inf  996 [219]  vs  648 [121] ng h mL −1 ). The median (range) t max  of esaxerenone when coadministered with itraconazole and when administered alone were 2.00 (1.00–4.00) hours and 2.25 (1.50–4.00) hours, respectively. The mean t 1/2  for esaxerenone was slightly prolonged after coadministration with itraconazole (25.9 [4.21] h) compared with esaxerenone alone (20.7 [3.96] h; Table  2 ).

The GLSM ratio (90% CI) of the C max  with and without coadministration of itraconazole was 1.13 (1.05, 1.20), which was within the  no‐DDI  range of 0.80 to 1.25. However, GLSM ratios (90% CI) of AUC last  and AUC inf  were 1.47 (1.40–1.54) and 1.53 (1.45–1.62), respectively, and were, therefore, above the no‐DDI range (Table  2 ). 3.3 Effects of rifampicin on esaxerenone PK (Study 2) Exposure to esaxerenone decreased in the presence of rifampicin (Figure  2b ; Table  3 ). The mean C max  decreased by 34.1% when esaxerenone was coadministered with rifampicin (47.6 [6.22] ng mL −1 ) rather than administered alone (72.4 [10.1] ng mL −1 ), and the AUC last  and AUC inf  were approximately 70% lower with coadministration  vs  esaxerenone alone (AUC last  347 [24.5]  vs  1110 [149] ng h mL −1 ; AUC inf  351 [24.8]  vs  1130 [150] ng h mL −1 ). The median (range) t max  of esaxerenone when coadministered with rifampicin or administered alone were 2.50 (1.00–4.00) hours and 2.50 (1.50–3.50) hours, respectively. The mean t 1/2  for esaxerenone was markedly shortened after coadministration with rifampicin (8.63 [1.67] h) compared with esaxerenone alone (16.6 [2.38] h; Table  3 ).

Esaxerenone C max , AUC last  and AUC inf  GLSM ratios (90% CI) when coadministered with rifampicin, compared with esaxerenone alone, were 0.659 (0.599–0.724), 0.315 (0.300–0.332) and 0.312 (0.297–0.328), respectively, and were below the no‐DDI range of 0.80–1.25 (Table  3 ). 3.4 Effects of rifampicin on esaxerenone metabolites (Study 2) Exposure to esaxerenone metabolites in the presence of rifampicin is shown in Figures  3a–c , and the PK parameters are listed in Table  4 . For M1, C max  and AUC last  were increased (more than doubled) by coadministration of rifampicin (Table  4 ). The M/P ratios for C max  and AUC last  for M1 were increased after coadministration of esaxerenone and rifampicin compared with esaxerenone alone (Table  4 ). The t 1/2  and AUC inf  of M1 could not be estimated because of the lack of an apparent terminal phase owing to a long t 1/2  for M1.

The C max  for M4 did not differ markedly after administration of esaxerenone plus rifampicin, compared with esaxerenone alone, whereas AUC last  and AUC inf  decreased by approximately 40% when esaxerenone was coadministered with rifampicin. The t 1/2  for M4 decreased from 17.3 (2.34) to 7.72 (3.12) hours in the presence of rifampicin. M/P ratios for C max , AUC last  and AUC inf  for M4 were increased by coadministration of rifampicin compared with esaxerenone alone (Table  4 ). The C max  of M11 decreased by approximately 50%, and AUC last  and AUC inf  were reduced by approximately 20% when esaxerenone was coadministered with rifampicin; t 1/2  decreased from 17.4 (2.53) to 7.14 (0.783) hours. M/P ratios for C max , AUC last  and AUC inf  for M11 were decreased for esaxerenone coadministered with rifampicin  vs  esaxerenone alone (Table  4 ). 3.5 Safety No serious AEs occurred in either study. Treatment‐emergent AEs (TEAEs) were reported by 1 subject in Study 1 and 2 subjects in Study 2 (Table  5 ). In Study 1, the only TEAE was increased blood creatine phosphokinase level, which occurred after the first dose of esaxerenone (mild severity; resolved without treatment) and was not considered by the investigator to be causally related to treatment. In Study 2, TEAEs considered by the investigator to be related to treatment were rash with esaxerenone alone (moderate severity; resolved with treatment) and increased eosinophil level (mild severity; resolved without treatment). Early withdrawal due to a TEAE occurred in 1 subject who experienced rash in Study 2. No clinically meaningful abnormalities in vital signs, electrocardiogram parameters or other laboratory values were observed in either study.

In Study 1, coadministration of itraconazole increased mean esaxerenone C max , AUC last  and AUC inf  by 12.6, 46.8 and 53.1%, respectively, and slightly prolonged the mean t 1/2  for esaxerenone. The slight increase in esaxerenone C max  observed after coadministration with itraconazole is likely due to increased esaxerenone bioavailability, which, in turn, may be secondary to increased absorption of esaxerenone caused by the inhibition of intestinal P‐gp and inhibition of the CYP3A involved in first‐pass metabolism in the small intestine and liver. The contribution of CYP3A to esaxerenone clearance was considered to be about 1/3 in the previously published mass‐balance study, 
 5 
  and there was sufficient plasma exposure of itraconazole to esaxerenone during the esaxerenone PK assessment period in the current study. Hence, our observed 1.5‐fold increase in esaxerenone AUCs during coadministration with itraconazole was considered a reasonable change, given that the 1/3 of esaxerenone clearance due to CYP3A was almost completely inhibited by itraconazole, reducing overall esaxerenone clearance to the remaining 2/3. Thus, the increase in esaxerenone exposure with itraconazole coadministration in the current study appears to be because of reduced esaxerenone clearance. However, the slightly increased esaxerenone AUC we observed was less pronounced than a corresponding 5‐fold increase in eplerenone exposure in the presence of ketoconazole. 
 6 
  Although the 1.5‐fold increase in esaxerenone AUC caused by itraconazole is unlikely to be of major clinical significance, this clinical interaction should not be overlooked in future therapeutic settings. Because it is generally known that serum K +  elevation is a side effect of MR antagonists, clinicians should exercise caution when treating patients with concurrent strong CYP3A inhibitors and esaxerenone. In Study 2, exposure to esaxerenone decreased in the presence of rifampicin. That is, coadministration with rifampicin decreased mean esaxerenone C max , AUC last  and AUC inf  by 34.1, 68.5 and 68.8%, respectively, compared with administration of esaxerenone alone. Esaxerenone CL/F increased and its t 1/2  was shortened when coadministered with rifampicin. Regarding the CYP3A induction effect of rifampicin, the dosing regimen of rifampicin in this study (600 mg once daily) was specifically selected to achieve a maximum induction effect of CYP3A, as previously described. 
 9 
 
 It has been suggested that esaxerenone has multiple metabolic pathways: oxidation, glucuronidation and hydrolysis. 
 5 
  Therefore, we evaluated the effects of rifampicin coadministration on the disposition of esaxerenone metabolites M1, M4 and M11, which were formed by CYP3A, UGT or hydrolysis followed by glucuronidation, respectively. Because of the long t 1/2  for M1, we cannot rule out the possibility that there may have been some carry‐over effect from Period 1 on the plasma concentration of M1 in Period 2. However, the data suggest that the increased plasma concentration of M1 in Period 2 was probably caused by CYP3A induction by rifampicin (Figure  3A ). M4 is formed by several UGT isoforms (1A1, 1A3, 1A9, 2B7 and 2B15), 
 5 
  and the M/P ratio for M4 based on C max , AUC last  and AUC inf  was increased when esaxerenone was coadministered with rifampicin, suggesting increased clearance of esaxerenone derived from induction of UGTs by rifampicin. The M/P ratio for M11, based on C max , AUC last  and AUC inf , was reduced when esaxerenone was coadministered with rifampicin. Induction of both CYP3A and UGTs by rifampicin may have reduced the contribution of hydrolysis to total metabolism, resulting in an M/P ratio decrease for M11. Overall, the observed changes in exposure of esaxerenone and its metabolites in the presence of rifampicin suggest that rifampicin induction of both CYP3A and UGTs explains the overall decrease in exposure to unchanged esaxerenone. The decreased esaxerenone C max  was probably because of decreased bioavailability resulting from increased intestinal and hepatic first‐pass metabolism, secondary to induction of CYP3A and UGTs by rifampicin. Additionally, reduced esaxerenone bioavailability may also be attributed to the induction of intestinal P‐gp by rifampicin, leading to reduced esaxerenone absorption. Therefore, esaxerenone efficacy may be reduced when the drug is administered concomitantly with rifampicin. In both studies, esaxerenone was safe and well tolerated when administered concomitantly with either itraconazole or rifampicin. However, as previously noted, it may be clinically prudent to monitor serum K +  levels when esaxerenone is coadministered with strong CYP3A inhibitors. Ethnic differences in the frequency of polymorphisms of CYP3A have been reported; however, they have rarely been linked to differences in PK between ethnic groups. 
 10 
  In a study assessing PK differences of esaxerenone in Japanese and Caucasian subjects, mean esaxerenone plasma concentrations after the administration of esaxerenone 20 mg were similar for both ethnicities (unpublished data on file, Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd.). Based on these results, it is unlikely that differences in CYP3A expression between Japanese and Caucasian populations influence esaxerenone metabolism. Limitations of our study included intersubject heterogeneity in CYP3A activity and the potential for CYP3A modulation by concomitant medications. In addition, the long elimination half‐life of M1 may have confounded the interpretation of the M/P results. In patients in a relevant clinical setting, the wider context of overall efficacy and safety should be considered when determining the clinical relevance of the observed DDIs. In particular, the influence of strong CYP3A inhibitor‐induced changes in esaxerenone exposure on overall esaxerenone safety warrant further evaluation. In conclusion, itraconazole increased esaxerenone AUC inf  by 53.1%, and rifampicin decreased esaxerenone AUC inf  by 68.8%. Therefore, caution is advised when coadministering esaxerenone with strong inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A.

    <Body>WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT Levodopa and carbidopa combination is the primary standard treatment in Parkinson's disease. Levodopa concentrations fluctuate significantly with oral treatment due to the unpredictable variability of gastric emptying and levodopa's short half-life. This contributes to the troublesome motor complications in advanced Parkinson's disease. Levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) was developed to overcome the limitations of oral treatment by providing continuous delivery through intrajejunal infusion. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS This study characterized the population pharmacokinetics of levodopa following jejunal administration of LCIG or oral administration of levodopa-carbidopa to subjects with advanced Parkinson's disease. Using the pharmacokinetic data from LCIG phase 1 and 3 clinical studies, this analysis compared levodopa bioavailability and the intra-subject variability in levodopa plasma concentrations for the two methods of administration in the target patient population. Introduction Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease [ 1 ]. The disease is characterized by progressive degeneration of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system and depletion of dopamine, which results in the core motor symptoms of bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and postural instability [ 2 ]. Levodopa is the amino-acid precursor of dopamine and replenishes the depleted striatal dopamine. Carbidopa is administered with levodopa to inhibit its extracerebral decarboxylation, allowing more levodopa to cross the blood–brain barrier to target the striatal dopamine receptors [ 3 ]. The combination of levodopa and carbidopa is the primary standard of treatment in Parkinson's disease [ 4 , 5 ]. Patients with Parkinson's disease suffer from periods of ‘off’ time (periods of poor mobility, slowness, and stiffness) that may alternate with periods of ‘on’ time (periods of good motor system control without troublesome dyskinesia). In advanced stages of Parkinson's disease, patients treated with oral levodopa may develop troublesome motor fluctuations at the end of each dose (wearing off), unpredictable swings from mobility to immobility (‘on–off’ phenomenon), or levodopa-induced dyskinesia, which closely correlate with fluctuating plasma concentrations of levodopa and pulsatile availability of dopamine [ 6 , 7 ]. Plasma concentrations of orally administered levodopa fluctuate due to its short half-life and the unpredictable variability of gastric emptying [ 4 ]. Treatments that offer more continuous dopaminergic stimulation may decrease the risk of development of motor fluctuations and dyskinesias and clinical evidence suggests that chronic (continuous) infusion of levodopa dramatically ameliorates motor fluctuations [ 8 – 11 ]. Levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) was developed to overcome the limitations of oral levodopa-carbidopa treatment. The LCIG System (Duodopa®) consists of a suspension of levodopa carbidopa monohydrate (4 : 1) in an aqueous gel (carboxymethyl cellulose) that is continuously delivered via a portable infusion pump to the proximal small intestine through a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy with jejunal extension (PEG-J). The delivery of LCIG directly to the proximal small intestine results in less variability in levodopa and carbidopa plasma concentrations and provides a continuous rather than intermittent stimulation of the dopaminergic receptors in the brain [ 9 , 11 , 12 ]. The objective of the present analysis was to characterize the population pharmacokinetics of levodopa following jejunal administration of LCIG or oral administration of immediate release levodopa-carbidopa (LC-oral) to subjects with advanced Parkinson's disease. Using the pharmacokinetic data from LCIG phase 1 and 3 clinical studies and a non-linear mixed-effects modelling approach, this analysis compares levodopa bioavailability and the intra-subject variability in levodopa plasma concentrations for the two methods of administration in the target patient population. Methods To characterize the population pharmacokinetics of levodopa following jejunal infusion of LCIG or frequent administration of LC-oral to subjects with advanced Parkinson's disease, levodopa pharmacokinetic data were combined from a phase 1 study and a phase 3 pivotal study of LCIG, where LC-oral was used as a comparator in the latter. Levodopa pharmacokinetic data from an open label phase 3 study of LCIG were used for external evaluation of the population model as described below. Study designs Studies included in model development Study 1 This was a multicentre, open-label pharmacokinetic study of LCIG in subjects with advanced Parkinson's disease. The study design was previously described in detail [ 12 ]. Male and female subjects already on stable LCIG (AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA) regimens for more than 30 days were enrolled in the study. Nineteen subjects were enrolled in the study and one subject was prematurely discontinued prior to the pharmacokinetic assessment day. LCIG was administered to the jejunum with a portable infusion pump (CADD-Legacy® Duodopa, Smiths Medical, MN, USA) via a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy with jejunal extension tube. Subjects were confined in the clinic for 2 days and the infusion duration on each day was 16 h (day −1 and day 1). On day −1, night-time LC-oral was allowed after termination of infusion and up to 3 h prior to the start of the pump on the pharmacokinetic day (day 1). On the pharmacokinetic day, all subjects received their individualized doses of LCIG. The total daily dose of LCIG was the sum of three components: morning (loading) dose, continuous (maintenance) dose and extra doses. At end of the infusion duration, the jejunal tubes were flushed with 3 ml of water to administer the drug product remaining in the tubing dead space. On the pharmacokinetic assessment day, the total mean (SD) LCIG dose of levodopa was 1580 (403) mg. The morning dose ranged from 4 to 11.5 ml (infused at a rate of 40 ml h –1 ), corresponding to 80 to 230 mg levodopa. The continuous dose infusion rate ranged from 2.7 to 6.1 ml h –1  (54 to 122 mg levodopa h –1 ). Extra doses were given if the patient became hypokinetic during the day. Use of extra doses of LCIG was discouraged during the pharmacokinetic sampling day, on which only two subjects received extra doses [two 2 ml (40 mg levodopa) extra doses for one subject and one 5 ml (100 mg levodopa) extra dose dose for another]. Serial blood samples were collected on the pharmacokinetic sampling day immediately prior to the initiation of LCIG infusion and at the following time points after the initiation of infusion: 5 min, immediately after the end of the morning dose, every 30 min up to 8 h (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8 h), 12, 16 (immediately after flushing the tube), 17, 18 and 19 h. Study 2 This was a 12 week, active-controlled, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group, multicentre study of the efficacy, safety and tolerability of LCIG in the treatment of levodopa-responsive subjects with advanced Parkinson's disease. Subjects had to have persistent motor fluctuations, despite optimized treatment with oral levodopa-carbidopa in addition to other available anti-Parkinson's disease medications to be eligible for the study. The study design was previously described in detail [ 11 ]. Subjects were randomly assigned to treatment with either a) LCIG infusion plus placebo capsules or b) over-encapsulated immediate release levodopa/carbidopa 100/25 mg (LC-oral) plus placebo gel infusion. A total of 71 subjects were randomized to treatment in this study. Of those, 37 subjects were randomly assigned to LCIG infusion plus placebo capsules and 34 subjects were randomly assigned to LC-oral plus placebo gel infusion. The gel was delivered via a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy with jejunal extension tube. Dosing of the gel and the capsules was individually optimized by titration to optimal effect (double-titration of capsules and gel to maintain blinding) during the first 4 weeks of the study. Subjects then remained on their individualized doses for the remaining 8 weeks of the study. The study drugs (gel infusion and capsules) were administered over a 16 h period and consisted of a morning dose (infusion and oral capsules) and a continuous infusion of the gel, and a regimen of oral capsules. Additional doses of open-label oral immediate-release levodopa-carbidopa tablets were used to treat acute changes in the subject's Parkinson's disease symptoms. During the 8 h the subjects were not receiving the infusion, they received individualized regimens of oral immediate-release levodopa-carbidopa tablets for symptom control. The mean (SD) daily levodopa dose from the double-blind treatment across the entire study period was 1117 (474) mg day −1  for LCIG and 1351 (618) mg day −1  for LC-oral. The mean (SD) total daily dose of levodopa from all sources was 1164 (483) mg for the LCIG group and 1409 (617) mg for the LC-oral group. For subjects enrolled early in the study ( n  = 20), planned pharmacokinetic sampling was on weeks 4 and 12 as follows: at 12, 16, 17, and 18 h post-initiation of intestinal gel infusion on days 28 and 84, and prior to initiation of intestinal gel infusion and after start of infusion at the following time points: 5 min, end of morning dose, and 1, 1.33, 1.67, 2, 2.33, 2.67, 4, 4.33, 4.67, 8, 8.33 and 8.67 h on days 29 and 85. For subjects enrolled later in the study ( n  = 51), planned pharmacokinetic sampling was only during week 6 to reduce the burden of the study procedures. For those subjects, pharmacokinetic samples were planned as follows: prior to initiation of intestinal gel infusion and after start of infusion at the following time points: 1, 2, 4, and 8 h on study day 43. Some subjects had additional blood samples collected at 12 and 16 h post-infusion initiation on study day 42. Study utilized in external evaluation of the model Study 3 This was a phase 3, open-label, multicentre study of the safety, tolerability and efficacy of LCIG administered for 12 months in subjects with levodopa-responsive advanced Parkinson's disease with severe motor fluctuations despite optimized treatment with available Parkinson's disease medications. A total of 354 subjects were allocated to treatment in this study. The study started with a nasojejunal test period (2 to 14 days) during which subjects received LCIG via a nasojejunal tube. This was followed by percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) surgery and post-PEG long term treatment period through the PEG-J tube. The study design was previously described in detail [ 13 ]. The LCIG dose was individually optimized by titration at the start of the nasojejunal phase and again at the start of the PEG-J phase. Once the treatment via PEG-J tube administration was optimized, the 12 month (52 weeks) post-PEG-J long term treatment period began, during which dosing of LCIG was to be changed according to clinical condition. Individually-optimized dosing of LCIG was delivered over a 16 h period, administered as a morning bolus followed by continuous infusion, and if needed, intermittent extra doses (patient-initiated based on symptom experience). Oral levodopa-carbidopa was allowed at night as supplemental night medication after disconnecting the pump or as rescue medication during the day if unable to use the extra dose pump infusion. The overall mean daily dose of levodopa from week 4 to endpoint was 1551 to 1572 mg day −1  from LCIG and 1614 to 1621 mg day −1  from all sources. One blood sample for pharmacokinetic analysis was collected during the post-PEG long term treatment period on days 28, 84, 168, and 378 (four total planned samples per subject). Bioanalysis Processing of the pharmacokinetic samples and analysis of levodopa plasma concentrations using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS/MS) were previously described in detail [ 12 ]. The analytical method was validated over a concentration range of 10 to 5000 ng ml −1 . Across studies, the %CV for levodopa analytical precision was ≤ 11% and the bias was within −6.4 to 4.8%. Population pharmacokinetic analysis dataset Sixty-eight male and female subjects with advanced Parkinson's disease who participated in studies 1 or 2 (18 subjects from study 1 and 50 subjects from study 2) and who had available pharmacokinetic data and dosing history information (recorded) during the pharmacokinetic sampling study days were included in the model development. Of the 68 subjects, 45 subjects received LCIG and 23 subjects received LC-oral. Sparse pharmacokinetic data from adult male and female subjects ( n  = 311) with advanced Parkinson's disease who participated in study 3 and who had plasma concentration and dosing history information during the pharmacokinetic sampling study days (recorded or imputed as described below) were included in the model external evaluation using stochastic simulations. Dosing records on the pharmacokinetic sampling days and the days immediately preceding pharmacokinetic sampling days were included in the analysis dataset. These dosing records were deemed sufficient to characterize the pharmacokinetics of levodopa since levodopa has a very short half-life (less than 2 h). All dosing records for any formulation containing levodopa-carbidopa (morning, continuous and extra-doses of LCIG, doses associated with LCIG tube flush, night-time, rescue and unclassified LC tablets and LC-oral capsules) were included in the analysis datasets. Dosing records included the amounts, dosing times, rates of infusion and infusion duration (when applicable, doses associated with tube flush were considered bolus). Actual dosing times, durations and sampling times were used in the analysis. Missing continuous infusion durations (for two occasions in the model development dataset) were assumed to be 16 h, per protocol. No other imputation of dosing information was conducted for the model development dataset. For the external evaluation dataset, missing dosing information on the pharmacokinetic sampling days was imputed from the days prior to pharmacokinetic sampling since dosing was to be stable during this period (309 out of the 311 subjects had imputed dosing at least on one occasion). Missing body weight values for two subjects in the external evaluation dataset were imputed with 70 kg (which approximated the median body weight in the dataset). All levodopa concentrations in the development and evaluation datasets were above the limit of quantitation. Model development The population pharmacokinetic model was developed using the non-linear mixed-effects modelling software  nonmem  (version 7.2; Icon Development Solutions, Ellicott City, MD, USA). The first order conditional estimation method (FOCE) with INTERACTION and a user-defined model (ADVAN6  nonmem  Subroutine) were used for the analysis. One and two compartment structural models were evaluated and the two compartment model was found to fit the data better. The two compartment model was parameterized in terms of clearance (CL), volume of central ( V c ) and peripheral ( V p ) compartments, inter-compartmental clearance (Q) and first order absorption rate constant ( K a ). Addition of parameters to the base model was conducted in a stepwise manner. Inclusion of either a lag-time or a transit compartment (between the dosing and central compartments) was evaluated. Inclusion of a relative bioavailability factor ( F rel ) where  F rel  was set to 1 for the oral LC formulations (LC-oral capsules and night-time, rescue, or unclassified LC tablets) as the reference and  F rel  was estimated for LCIG (morning doses, continuous infusion, extra-doses and doses associated with tube flush) was evaluated. Estimation of a different transit rate constant for absorption ( K tr ) for the LC-oral treatment was assessed. Body weight was evaluated as a covariate for CL,  V c ,  V p  and Q and age was evaluated as a covariate for CL using a power model as described with the following equation (1) where TVP l  is the typical value of evaluated parameter P for a subject with covariate value of l (Cov l ), PF is a normalization factor (70 kg for body weight and 60 years for age). Accordingly, Pθ 2  is a constant that determines the non-linear relationship between the parameter and the normalized covariate value and Pθ 1  is the typical parameter value for a subject with 70 kg body weight or 60 years of age. For body weight, an estimated Pθ 2  or a fixed value of 0.75 for clearance parameters and 1 for volume parameters (allometric models) were evaluated. Gender and entacapone [a catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor; COMT is an enzyme involved in metabolism of levodopa] concomitant use were evaluated as covariates for levodopa clearance via binary indicator variables (0 or 1) as follows: (2) where CLθ 1  is the typical clearance value for the reference group for each binary covariate (males or subjects who did not concomitantly use entacapone) and CLθ 2  is the ratio of the clearance of females (CovIND = 1) to males (CovIND = 0) or ratio of clearance of subjects who concomitantly used entacapone (CovIND = 1) to those who did not use entacapone (CovIND = 0) on the pharmacokinetic sampling days. The majority of subjects in the analysis dataset were of White race. Therefore, race could not be robustly evaluated as a covariate on clearance. Inter-subject variability in CL,  V c  and  K tr  (or  K a  in the starting models) was estimated using an exponential error model as follows: (3) where η i  is the proportional difference between the parameter estimate of the i th  subject (P i ) and the typical population parameter value (TVP) and η i  is assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of 0 and a variance of ω 2 . Covariance between inter-subject variability in the pharmacokinetic parameter was evaluated using the BLOCK statement in  nonmem . The residual random error was modeled using a combined proportional and additive error models as follows: (4) where  C ij  is the measured plasma concentration of the i th  individual at time j,  Ĉ ij  is the corresponding model predicted concentration, and ε 1ij  and ε 2ij  are the proportional and additive components, respectively, of the residual random error. Each of the residual error components was assumed to be independently normally distributed with a mean of 0 and variances of σ 2 : ε n  ∼ N (0,  ). Different residual error variances for subjects treated with LCIG (study 1 and arm 1 of study 2)  vs.  subjects treated with LC-oral (arm 2 of study 2) were evaluated. Several criteria were used to evaluate the improvement in the model performance and to select the final model. The Likelihood Ratio Test was used for comparing rival hierarchical models where a decrease in  nonmem  objective function (–2 log likelihood) of 7.88 points was necessary to consider the improvement in model performance statistically significant at α = 0.005 and 1 degree of freedom [ 14 ]. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used for comparing rival non-hierarchical models [ 15 ]. Other selection criteria used included improved goodness of fit and residual plots, increased precision in parameter estimation and reduced variance of inter-subject and residual errors. Model internal evaluation Bootstrap evaluation The robustness of the final model was evaluated using non-parametric bootstrap. In this procedure, subjects were randomly sampled with replacement from the original dataset (with no stratification) to form 1000 new datasets each having the same number of subjects as the original dataset. The final model was then fitted to the bootstrap datasets and all the model parameters were estimated. The median and 95% confidence interval (defined by the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles) for each parameter were then calculated from the successfully converging runs (regardless of success of the covariance step) and compared with the point estimates from the original dataset. Visual predictive check The adequacy of the final model was evaluated using standard visual predictive check (VPC) as well as prediction-corrected VPC (pcVPC) [ 16 ]. The final model parameters were used to simulate 500 replicates of the observed data using  nonmem . For calculation of summary statistics and graphical display, observed and simulated concentration data were categorized by rounded time after dosing. Time after dosing was defined as the time relative to start of morning infusion of LCIG or time relative to administration of the immediately preceding dose of LC-oral. Time points with low number of concentrations were combined with adjacent time points. Simulated negative plasma concentrations (because of the additive component of the error model) were replaced with zero. In the standard VPC, the observed data as well as calculated statistics [median, 5th percentile (P5) and 95th percentile (P95)] of observed concentrations were compared graphically to the 95% confidence intervals for the median, P5 and P95 of simulated concentrations. The 95% confidence intervals for the median, P5 and P95 of simulated concentrations were calculated from the 2.5th percentile and 97.5th percentiles of each parameter across simulated replicates. In the pcVPC, to normalize for the variability in independent variables (dose, time and body weight) in the graphical display of the predictive performance of the model, the observations and simulations were normalized based on the typical population predictions as follows and previously described [ 16 ]. (5) where Y ij  is the observed or simulated plasma concentration for subject i at time j, pcY ij  is the prediction-corrected Y ij,  PRED ij  is the typical model prediction (PRED) for Y ij , PRED bin  is the median value of all the PREDs in the bin within which Y ij  is graphically presented. The PRED-corrected observed and simulated values were then summarized and displayed graphically as described above for the standard VPC. Model external evaluation The final model parameters were used to simulate 500 replicates of study 3 pharmacokinetic data using  nonmem . Study 3 was not used for the model development. Therefore, this represents an external evaluation of the predictive ability of the model for LCIG. The external evaluation provides no information on the ability of the model to predict data for LC-oral since LC-oral was not evaluated in study 3. Calculation of summary statistics and graphical display of observed and simulated data for study 3 was conducted as described above under visual predictive check. PRED corrections for the observed and simulated concentrations were also conducted. TIBCO Spotfire S + ® 8.1 for Windows was used for statistical calculations and for graphical display of the results. Results Demographics and subject disposition Summary of the demographic data for the subjects included in the development and evaluation of the levodopa pharmacokinetic model are presented in Table  1 . Among the subjects included in model development, 12 subjects reported concomitant use of entacapone on the pharmacokinetic sampling days. For model development and internal evaluation, 1182 levodopa plasma concentrations were available from 68 subjects. For external evaluation of the model, 1041 levodopa plasma concentrations were available from 311 subjects. Four out of the 1041 concentrations were later excluded from the external evaluation because they were clearly erroneous.

BMI, body mass index. Levodopa pharmacokinetic model The levodopa pharmacokinetic model building history and the associated changes in  nonmem  objective function are presented in supporting information  Table S1 . The base model was a two compartment model with a transit compartment for absorption (between the dosing and central compartments) and first order elimination. The model was parameterized in terms of clearance (CL), volume of central compartment ( V c ), volume of peripheral compartment ( V p ), inter-compartmental clearance (Q) and first-order transit rate constant for absorption ( K tr ). Inter-subject variability was estimated for CL,  V c  and  K tr  using an exponential model. The residual variability was estimated using a combined additive and proportional error models. The transit compartment model was selected over the lag-time model since the transit compartment model has one less parameter and transit models are generally more numerically stable than lag-time models. The two models (lag time and transit) provided comparable objective functions once relevant covariates were incorporated (supporting information  Table S1 ). Inclusion of formulation (LCIG  vs . oral LC) as a covariate on bioavailability significantly improved the model fit (ΔOF = −28.60,  P  &lt; 0.005). A relative bioavailability factor ( F rel ) was included in the model where  F rel  was set to 1 for the oral LC formulations (LC-oral capsules and night-time, rescue, or unclassified LC tablets) as the reference and  F rel  was estimated for LCIG (morning doses, continuous infusion, extra doses and doses associated with tube flush). The estimated relative bioavailability for LCIG in the final model was 97% (95% bootstrap confidence interval: 95 to 98%). Estimation of a different transit rate constant for absorption ( K tr ) for the LC-oral treatment arm of study 2 resulted in further significant reduction in the  nonmem  objective function (ΔOF = −13.14,  P  &lt; 0.005). Inclusion of body weight (normalized to 70 kg) as a covariate for  V c  using an allometric model with a fixed exponent of 1 improved the model fit (ΔOF = −9.13,  P  &lt; 0.005). Inclusion of body weight as a covariate on levodopa clearance did not improve the model fit to any appreciable extent (3.5 and 5.9 points reduction in  nonmem  objective function for fixed 0.75 or estimated allometric exponent for relationship between levodopa clearance and body weight, respectively,  P  &gt; 0.01). Additionally, levodopa clearance was not found to be statistically significantly correlated with gender of the subject or concomitant use of the catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitor, entacapone ( P  &gt; 0.01). Age almost reached significance for inclusion as a covariate for levodopa clearance (ΔOF = –7.65,  P  = 0.0057). Estimating different residual error variances for subjects treated with LCIG (Study 1 and treatment arm 1 of study 2)  vs.  subjects treated with LC-oral (arm 2 of study 2) significantly improved the model fit (ΔOF = −189, Table 5). Finally, estimating covariance between inter-subject variability in CL and  K tr  resulted in further reduction in the objective function (ΔOF = −7.93,  P  &lt; 0.005, Table 5). Using a full covariance matrix for inter-subject variability in CL,  V c  and  K tr  did not result in further significant improvement in the model fit. Diagnostic plots for the final model are presented in Figure  1 A– 1 D. Scatter plots of population predicted  vs . observed levodopa concentration (Figure  1 A) and the individual predicted  vs.  observed levodopa concentrations (Figure  1 B) showed symmetric distribution around the line of identity and good agreement between observed and individual predicted concentrations, indicating that the model fit the data well at the population and individual subjects levels. Scatter plots of the conditional weighted residuals [ 17 ]  vs . population predicted levodopa concentrations or time did not show any systematic bias in the model fit.

Dashed lines represent ± 3 SD in C and D The shrinkage of inter-subject variability (ETA shrinkage) [ 18 ] for CL/ F, V c / F  and  K tr  was 8%, 25% and 24%, respectively. The shrinkage of the proportional and additive intra-subject variability (Epsilon Shrinkage) was 6% for LCIG and 5% for LC-oral.

Model evaluation Internal evaluation The final model converged for 977 out of the 1000 bootstrap datasets (of those, covariance step was complete for 856 datasets). The median and 95% confidence intervals (calculated as the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles) of the bootstrap parameter estimates are presented in Table  2 . The median parameter estimates from the bootstrap datasets were comparable with the point estimates from the original dataset. Additionally, the bootstrap calculated uncertainty in the fixed effects parameter estimates were generally in agreement with the uncertainty in the estimates from the original dataset. The standard VPC for the final model stratified by treatment is presented in Figure  2 . The prediction-corrected VPC is presented in Figure  3 . Using the final model, there was good agreement between the observed and simulated levodopa plasma concentrations with the medians, 5th and 95th percentiles of observed levodopa plasma concentrations falling within the simulated confidence intervals for these parameters during the majority of the time course, particularly after normalizing for the variability in the independent variables (doses, time of sampling, body weight differences) using the PRED correction (Figure  3 ).

The analysis utilized combined levodopa intensive pharmacokinetic data from 68 subjects who participated in a phase 1 pharmacokinetic study or a phase 3 double-blind double-dummy efficacy study of LCIG. The developed model compares levodopa absorption, bioavailability and intra-subject variability for the two treatment modalities in the target patient population for LCIG use. Results from the present analysis demonstrate that LCIG has comparable bioavailability to the oral levodopa-carbidopa 100/25 mg immediate release (IR) tablets (over-encapsulated Sinemet tablets used as active control in the LCIG phase 3 study). The bioavailability estimate for levodopa from LCIG relative to LC-oral was 97% (95% bootstrap confidence interval of 95% to 98%). Comparable levodopa bioavailability for LCIG and LC-oral is in agreement with direct delivery of levodopa to the proximal small intestine with LCIG infusion, where the expression of the large neutral amino acid transporter, the absorptive carrier of levodopa, is highest [ 12 ]. No previous studies have been conducted to characterize directly the absolute bioavailability of levodopa from LCIG or the bioavailability of LCIG relative to immediate release oral levodopa-carbidopa. With standard LC-oral (4 : 1 ratio) tablets, Yeh  et al . reported an absolute levodopa bioavailability of 84 ± 13% in healthy young subjects and 99 ± 21% in elderly subjects [ 19 ]. A pooled analysis from 20 patients across three small LCIG studies by Westin  et al . suggested that LCIG has an absolute bioavailability of 88% with duodenal delivery [ 20 ]. The analysis by Westin  et al . had the limitation of fixing levodopa disposition parameters to values reported in the literature for intravenous infusion in different patients. It is also noteworthy that the majority of patients who contributed to the dataset analyzed by Westin  et al . received LCIG through a nasoduodenal tube, not through PEG-J as in the current clinical practice. Overall, results from the present analysis (directly) and the analysis by Westin  et al . (indirectly) demonstrate that delivery of LCIG to the proximal small intestine (jejunum or duodenum) results in comparable bioavailability to oral levodopa-carbidopa. The results of the present analysis also suggest that LCIG is absorbed faster than LC-oral, consistent with skipping residence in the stomach with LCIG jejunal delivery. The first order absorption transit rate constant was estimated to be 9.2 h –1  for LCIG and 2.4 h –1  for LC-oral (corresponding mean absorption time of 7 min for LCIG  vs . 25 min for LC-oral; estimated from the entire pharmacokinetic dataset regardless of food intake for both treatments). In a typical patient simulation, this difference corresponds to a 30 min earlier  t max  for a 200 mg morning infusion of LCIG compared with a 200 mg oral dose ( t max  45 min for LCIG  vs . 75 min for LC-oral). Both one compartment [ 21 , 22 ] and two compartment [ 23 , 24 ] structural models have been previously used to describe the pharmacokinetics of levodopa administered with a decarboxylase inhibitor. In the present analysis, a two compartment model described levodopa disposition better than a one compartment model. Body weight was a statistically significant covariate for levodopa  V c  ( V c  allometrically scaled on 70 kg normalized body weight with an exponent of 1). Inclusion of body weight as a covariate for levodopa clearance did not improve the model fit to any appreciable extent. Similarly, Jorga  et al . reported body weight as a significant covariate for levodopa volume of distribution, but not clearance [ 22 ]. Chan  et al . included body weight as a covariate on all levodopa disposition parameters in their analysis as a standard approach supported by the principles of allometry [ 24 ]. However, the results from Chan  et al . also suggest that body weight explained more of the between-subject variability in levodopa's  V c  than in levodopa's total clearance. In our analysis, introduction of body weight as a covariate on all the clearance and volume parameters resulted in more deviation of the remaining inter-subject variability (η) for clearance from the normality assumption (data not shown). Therefore, body weight was retained as a covariate for the volume of distribution only in the final model. Gender was not found to be a statistically significant covariate for levodopa clearance in the present analysis. This is in agreement with the analysis by Chan  et al . [ 24 ]. Jorga  et al . suggested that gender is not a statistically significant covariate for levodopa clearance in subjects without motor fluctuations but it is a statistically significant covariate for levodopa clearance in subjects with motor fluctuations [ 22 ]. The presence of a gender-related effect on levodopa pharmacokinetics has been in evaluated in several other studies using non-compartmental approaches and conflicting evidence has been reported [ 25 – 27 ]. It has been suggested that the apparent gender-related difference in exposure was partly because of incorrectly normalizing for body weight difference between males and females in some analyses [ 27 ]. Based on the present analysis and previously reported population analyses of levodopa [ 22 , 23 ], there is no clinically meaningful gender-related difference in levodopa clearance. Earlier studies suggested modest reduction of levodopa clearance with increase in age [ 28 , 29 ]. The population analyses by Jorga  et al . and Chan  et al . did not find age as a significant covariate for explaining inter-subject variability in levodopa clearance [ 22 , 23 ]. In the present analysis, age was not included as a covariate for clearance in the final model but it almost reached the set criterion for inclusion in the model ( P  = 0.0057). Finally, no statistically significant relationship was found between concomitant use of the catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitor, entacapone, and levodopa clearance. However, few subjects in the analysis dataset reported concomitant use of entacapone on the pharmacokinetic sampling days. Therefore, the available limited information does not allow for a meaningful conclusion. The estimated value of levodopa oral clearance in the present analysis (24.8 l h −1 , 95% bootstrap confidence interval 20.4 to 26.8 l h −1 ) is in middle of the previously reported range in the literature (7.7–38.5 l h −1  as summarized by Chen  et al . [ 23 ]). Levodopa steady-state volume of distribution ( V c  +  V p ) (131 l, 95% bootstrap confidence interval of 63.6 to 461 l) is at the upper end of the reported range of 15.4 to 124 l across different analysis methodologies [ 23 ]. The between subject variability in levodopa oral clearance and volume of distribution in the present analysis (32 and 61%, respectively) are in line with previously reported values by Jorga  et al . for oral administration (26 to 33% for levodopa clearance and 42 to 80% for volume of distribution). In the final model, administration of LCIG was estimated to be associated with approximately half the intra-subject variability in levodopa concentrations compared with administration of oral levodopa-carbidopa in subjects with advanced Parkinson's disease. The estimated proportional residual error (first component of intra-subject variability) was 15% for LCIG  vs . 29% for LC-oral. The estimated standard deviation of the additive residual error in levodopa concentrations (second component of intra-subject variability) was 0.3 μg ml −1  for LCIG  vs . 0.59 μg ml −1  for LC-oral. These results are consistent with previous findings by Nyholm  et al . which demonstrated that the average intra-subject coefficient of variation, calculated using standard statistical methods, for the plasma levodopa concentrations was 14% during continuous duodenal infusion of LCIG  vs . 34% during oral therapy ( P  &lt; 0.01) [ 9 ]. In summary, we developed a population model that describes levodopa pharmacokinetics with LCIG jejunal infusion or LC-oral administration in subjects with advanced Parkinson's disease. The analysis results demonstrate that levodopa bioavailability is comparable for LCIG infusion and LC-oral administration. LCIG jejunal infusion results in approximately half the intra-subject variability in levodopa concentrations observed with LC-oral administration. LCIG is absorbed faster than LC-oral, consistent with direct delivery of LCIG to the jejunum. The developed model was robust and replicated the features of the data from which it was built in simulations. In addition, the model was able to predict adequately levodopa plasma concentrations for a study of LCIG that was not utilized in model development. The model will be a useful research tool and can help optimize dosing with LCIG. </Body>

    <Body>What is Already Known about this Subject 
 A challenge model provides a novel approach of assessing the efficacy of antimalarial drugs under controlled conditions. Healthy subjects are infected with the blood stage  P. falciparum  parasite. The experimental infection under tightly controlled conditions, as opposed to patient populations, allows for close monitoring of parasite growth and drug effects, including controlling the dose of parasites administered compared with malaria infections induced by a mosquito bite. 
 P. falciparum  strain 3D7 has a well‐characterised drug sensitivity profile, allowing for comparison with other drugs. 
 What this Study Adds 
 The present study in eight subjects provides the results of the proof‐of‐concept study of Actelion‐451840, showing that the new compound is active against blood stage  P. falciparum  infection. The implementation of the challenge model in the controlled environment of clinical studies generated robust PK and PD data. Model‐based predictions based on a large simulated population of patients allow estimation of curative doses or dosing regimens in patients with clinical malaria. The model predicted that 90% of subjects would be cured with six daily doses of Actelion‐451840. Thus, a small study coupled with population modelling provided sufficient information for decision‐making. 
 Introduction Malaria is one of the most important infectious diseases, threatening half of the world's population. In accordance to the latest estimates by the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2014, there were 198 million cases of this parasitic disease (infection with  P. falciparum ) out of the estimated 3.3 billion people at risk and with an estimated 584000 deaths. 90% of the mortality was in sub‐Saharan Africa, mostly among children under 5 years of age, attributing 78% of deaths  1 . The WHO has declared malaria control a global development priority and has changed its recommendation from control programmes to eradication programmes. New drugs will be needed to make this possible  2 . The widespread resistance of  P. falciparum  to conventional monotherapies such as chloroquine, amodiaquine and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine led to an urgent need for new therapies to combat increasing levels of resistance. The WHO currently recommends artemisinin‐based combination therapy (ACT) as the first line therapy in areas with high prevalence of resistance  3 . Even though the artemisinins are the most potent and rapidly acting antimalarial agents available to date  4 , they are associated with high recrudescence rates when used as monotherapy. However, worrying evidence of its decreasing efficacy is now widespread through south east Asia  5 . Because of the concern for resistance development, new drugs with new mechanisms of action are needed. The development of these drugs requires fast efficient processes. Actelion‐451840
 1 The compound's actual name is ACT‐451840. To avoid confusion with artemisinin combination therapy (ACT), we refer to it as Actelion‐451840 in the summary and as 451840 in the main manuscript.  is a new chemical entity  6  and potent inhibitor of both multidrug‐resistant and sensitive  P. falciparum  asexual blood stage parasites, with  in vitro  I C 
 50  values in the sub‐nanomolar range (7G8: 0.3 n m ; Dd2: 0.7 n m ; NF54: 0.6 n m )  7 . The proposed mechanism of action of 451840 is the blocking of the MDR1 pump on the parasitophorous digestive vacuole membrane in addition to gametocidal activity  7 . Similar to artemisinins, 451840 targets the blood stages of infection and has a rapid onset of action. Furthermore, 451840 is efficacious in animal models and has a good safety profile. Its mechanism of action is under investigation, with  in vitro  evidence suggesting that its activity is mediated by blocking a parasite‐digestive vacuole membrane‐resident transporter termed PfMDR1  7 . These properties make 451840 a potential new drug for the treatment of  P. falciparum  malaria. The safety and pharmacokinetic profile (PK) of single doses of 10, 50, 200 and 500 mg in the fasted state and 200 and 500 mg in the fed state in healthy subjects have been reported previously  6 . No serious adverse events or adverse events leading to discontinuation of the study were observed in 30 subjects treated with 451840. The relatively low exposure in the fasted state increased approximately 14‐fold when the drug was administered in the fed state, with slightly less than dose‐proportional exposure  6 . Historically, antiparasitic activity of candidate antimalarial drugs was determined in large phase 2 trials in patients. These require large amounts of resources and long timelines for execution. The benefits of obtaining such data using a human blood stage challenge model as previously described  8  include the ability to obtain critical data earlier in the drug development process, in a controlled setting with lower potential for variability in efficacy and safety, not confounded by previously acquired protective immune responses  9 , different sites, investigators, etc., and that it has simpler logistics, i.e. participant recruitment, drug supply, data management, etc. The current study served as the proof‐of‐concept study to characterize the antimalarial effect of a single dose of 500 mg 451840 on  P. falciparum  parasite clearance from the blood of experimentally infected healthy subjects. Methods Induced blood stage malaria infection was used to characterize the activity of 451840 against early blood stage  P. falciparum  infection. The procedure is described in  8 . Subjects Eight healthy male subjects agreeing to use a double barrier method of contraception for at least 14 days up to the time of dosing through 90 days after dosing were recruited. Study design The study was a proof‐of‐concept, single centre, open label phase 1b study. Each participant in the cohort was intravenously inoculated on day 0 with ~1800 viable  P. falciparum  (strain 3D7)‐infected human erythrocytes (blood stage  P. falciparum  challenge inoculum, BSPC). Subjects were monitored daily (a.m.) on an outpatient basis from day 4 until quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was positive for the presence of malaria parasites. Once PCR‐positive, subjects were monitored twice daily for adverse events and the unexpected early onset of symptoms, signs or parasitological evidence of malaria. When parasite counts reached ≥1000 counts ml −1  (or ≥5,000 counts ml −1  in a particular subject), subjects were admitted to the study unit and treatment with 451840 was started. A 25 ml suspension containing 500 mg 451840 was administered as a single dose orally under fed conditions followed by 175 ml of tap water. Compulsory commencement of treatment with Riamet® (artemether/lumefantrine) to ensure complete clearance of any gametocytes present occurred on the 16 th  day post 451840 treatment or earlier (in case of PCR evidence of recrudescence, parasite counts exceeding 500 parasites ml −1 ). The regimen consisted of four tablets  per os  twice a day at 0, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 h, making a total dose of 24 tablets in six doses. The drug was administered with fatty food, following e FDA guidance  10 . Subjects consumed a high fat (approximately 50% of total caloric content of the meal) and high calorie (approximately 800 to 1000 calories) breakfast on the dosing day, completed over a 20 min period and finished no longer than 10 min before study drug administration. The high fat/high calorie breakfast had the same composition for all subjects, two eggs fried in butter, two strips of bacon, two slices of toast with butter, 100 g of hash brown potatoes and 250 ml of whole milk. Pharmacokinetic assessments Blood for PK assessment of 451840 was sampled pre‐dose, at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 144 h after drug administration. The bioanalytical methods were the same as previously reported  6 . Drug concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 0.1 ng ml −1 . The inter‐batch precision was between 2.4% and 5.3%, whereas the inter‐batch accuracy was in the range of 95.3% to 103.6% of nominal concentration. An  ex vivo  bioassay to assess the inhibitory effect of treated subjects' serum on the growth of  P. falciparum  (laboratory strain NF54) was undertaken by quantification of [ 3 H]‐hypoxanthine incorporated in post‐dose samples relative to pre‐dose controls as previously described  11 ,  12 . The active drug concentrations in the bioassay are expressed in equivalents of 451840  6 . The LLOQ was 0.2 ng ml −1 . Samples were collected at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 and 48 h. Samples taken at 72, 96 and 144 h after drug intake concentrations were almost entirely below the LLOQ and not used for data analysis. Parasitological assessments Assessment of parasitaemia was undertaken by PCR as previously described  13 . Blood samples were collected at baseline, at 08.00 h on day 4, and then at 08.00 h and 20.00 h from day 5 to confinement. During confinement, blood samples were collected for PCR at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 30, 36 and 48 h (exit from unit) as well as at 60, 72, 84, 96, 120 and 144 h after 451840 intake. Further samples were taken on an individual basis until the last artemether/lumefantrine dosing day and at the final visit (day 28/end of study). Previous studies had indicated that following treatment with some licensed antimalarial drugs, such as sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine  14  and piperaquine  15 , gametocytaemia becomes apparent after drug treatment. As an exploratory analysis, to test if 451840 blocks the appearance of gametocytaemia, we undertook PCR analysis for the mature gametocyte‐specific transcript  pfs25  as previously described  15 . Statistical considerations The number of subjects was determined based on previous studies that had determined that a cohort size of eight subjects provided 80% power to identify a difference of 25% in the rate of decline of parasite kinetics as statistically significant in a two‐sided test at the 5% level  8 . Statistical summary of PK and PD data Individual plasma and serum concentration–time data as well as derived PK parameters were summarised descriptively. PK parameters were evaluated from the plasma concentrations using non‐compartmental methods in the Phoenix WinNonlin® software version 6.1  16 . The other analyses were carried out using SAS software version 9.3  17 . Pharmacodynamics and statistical assessments Efficacy parameters were analysed descriptively. The subject specific parasite reduction rate over a 48 h period (PRR 48 , i.e. the fold‐reduction in parasitaemia over a 48 h period (the asexual life cycle of the parasite) after removing potential lag and tail phases), denoting the drug‐specific killing rate  8 , its 95% confidence interval (CI) and the parasite clearance half‐life (time to 50% reduction in parasite concentration) were derived from the slopes of log‐linear regression models of subjects with appropriate overall fit ( P  value of overall model  F  test &lt;0.001) as detailed in  14 . The drug‐specific slope was derived as weighted average with weights proportional to the inverse variance, from which drug specific PRR 48  and parasite clearance half‐life were derived  14 . The lower limit of detection (LOD) was 64 parasites ml −1  of blood  13 . Values below the LOD (but still detectable parasite counts) were substituted by LOD/2 and values that were non‐detectable were substituted by 1  11 . An analysis of previous studies indicated that if parasitaemia falls below a calculated threshold of 0.003 parasites ml −1 , parasites would not rebound, denoting eradication from the system. The cure threshold was therefore set to 0.003 parasites ml −1 . PK/PD modelling A PK/PD model was developed to characterize the relation between drug concentration and parasite clearance. The PK model characterises absorption, distribution and elimination of the drug. Parasite concentration was modelled using an exponential growth model. The change in parasite concentration was modelled as the joint effects of parasite growth and drug concentration using the model in  8 :
 dP dt = P G − D c γ c γ + IC 50 γ 
 The initial condition is P 0 , the parasite concentration at the time of inoculation. P denotes the parasite count ml −1 ,  t  time in h, G the first order parasite growth rate in absence of drug, D the maximum parasite reduction rate (drug specific),  c  the drug concentration in ng ml −1  and I C 
 50  the drug concentration required to achieve half the maximum parasite reduction rate. The parameter γ denotes an optional non‐linearity parameter defining the steepness of the concentration−effect curve (also known as the Hill coefficient). The model describes exponential growth and killing of the parasites. When no drug is present (concentration  c  = 0), the parasite concentration changes by the growth factor G per unit of time, h. For example, if G = 0.1, the parasite concentration increases by 0.1 or 10% per h. The drug effect manifests by a kill rate that depends on the drug concentration, increasing with higher concentrations  c . The resulting parasite count change h −1  is given as the difference between the growth rate and the drug effect, characterized by D, I C 
 50  and the current drug concentration,  c . For example, if G = 0.1, D = 0.2, and  c  = I C 
 50 , then G − D*( c /( c  + I C 
 50 )) = 0.1–0.2*(1/2) = 0 and thus the drug effect counterbalances the parasite growth and there is no change in parasite concentration. For higher concentrations, the parasite concentration reduces over time. R  18  was used for the programming of the modelling data sets and data exploration. Fitting of the population PK/PD model, the determination of the model parameters that best fitted the observed data, was carried out using Monolix  19  and the stochastic approximation of expectation maximization (SAEM) algorithm. Data below the LLOQ (PK) and the LOD (PD) were tagged as BLQ and estimated, corresponding to the method M3  20 . Visualization of the model and simulation of alternative doses and dosing regimens were performed using Mlxplore  21 , including inter‐individual and stochastic variability. Results Subject demographics All eight subjects were male with a mean (range) age of 24 (19–38) years, body weight of 77 (59–98) kg, height of 179 (167–191) cm and a BMI of 24 (20–28) kg m −2 . The races were Caucasian (4), Indian (2), Asian (1) and Native Hawaiian (1). One subject was an ex‐smoker and all others never smoked. Tolerability 451840 was well tolerated with no AEs attributed to the investigational drug. Mild AEs attributable to malaria, which the subjects were told to expect, were common. These typically occurred at the time of parasite recrudescence (see below). Except for one AE of nausea that was considered related to the administration of artemether/lumefantrine, all AEs were attributed to malaria. The most frequently reported AE attributed to malaria was headache (87.5%), followed by pyrexia (62.5%) and myalgia (62.5%). All AEs were mild to moderate and resolved without sequelae by the end of the study. No clinically significant changes in vital signs were documented. No clinically significant abnormalities in haematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation variables or electrocardiogram recordings were identified. Pharmacokinetics Following single dose administration of 500 mg 451840, the geometric mean (95% CI) AUC(0,∞) and  C 
 max  was 1284.4 ng ml −1  h (919.6, 1794.1) and 121.7 ng ml −1  (90.6, 163.5), respectively. Median  t 
 max  was 4 h (minimum–maximum: 3–6 h). The geometric mean  t 
 1/2  was 36.4 h (30.2–43.9). The apparent values based on antiparasitic activity in the bioassay, following single dose administration of 500 mg 451840 were the following: the geometric mean (95% CI) AUC(0,∞) and  C 
 max  were 6081.5 ng ml −1  h (4040.1–9590.9) and 547.0 ng ml −1  (390.7–792.7), respectively. Median  t 
 max  was 4.0 h (minimum–maximum: 4–8 h). The geometric mean  t 
 1/2  was 6.8 h (5.1–9.2). Individual PK profiles are shown in Figure  1 . Figure 1 Pharmacokinetics: individual drug concentration–time profiles, linear (A) and semi‐logarithmic scale (B). (R001   R002   R003   R004   R005   R006   R007   R008  ) Pharmacodynamics All subjects reached the threshold for initiation of treatment, 1000 parasites ml −1 , on the same day (day 7) with the exception of one subject, R002, who had a parasite concentration just below the threshold. Treatment was started simultaneously for all subjects (168 h after parasite inoculation). After an initial reduction in parasitaemia, recrudescent parasite growth was observed in all subjects after 100 h and in one subject after more than 200 h (Figure S2, subject R002). This required per‐protocol rescue treatment with artemether/lumefantrine (Figure  2 ). Figure 2 Pharmacodynamics: parasite concentration over time after inoculum (A) and after treatment start, semi‐logarithmic scale (B). (R001   R002   R003   R004   R005   R006   R007   R008  ) The drug specific PRR 48  and parasite clearance half‐life were calculated as 73.6/48 h (95% CI 56.1, 96.5,  n  = 8) and 7.7 h (95% CI 7.3, 8.3,  n  = 8), respectively. All individuals had significant regression estimates ( P  &lt; 0.001) and contributed to the drug specific estimates (Figure S1). For one subject (12.5%), non‐detectable parasite density at 48 h (parasite clearance) was observed. Gametocytaemia No evidence of the appearance of gametocytes as determined by PCR for the gametocyte specific transcript  pfs25  was observed. PK/PD modelling Exploratory data analysis, visualisations of individual drug concentration over time (PK) and parasite concentration over time (PD) profiles, shows variability between subjects, but generally a consistent pattern. Drug elimination showed a biphasic profile on the semi‐logarithmic scale, suggesting a two compartment PK model (Figure  1 ). Parasite growth showed a similar pattern between subjects. The drug effect, parasite reduction over time, showed very similar effects with respect to the decline (slope), starting from different baseline levels (Figure  2 ). Starting with a one compartment model without absorption lag time, introducing a second compartment and absorption lag time improved the model fit significantly. Therefore, the PK model was identified as a two compartment model with absorption lag time and first order absorption and elimination. Fitting a PK model with Hill coefficient showed large standard errors in the parameter estimate for the Hill coefficient. Fixing the Hill coefficient to 1 provided stable PK parameter estimates. A joint estimation of PK and PD allowed estimation of the Hill coefficient with reasonable accuracy. The initial aim to first fit the PD data prior to start of treatment, i.e. only the parasite growth phase, proved numerically unstable while fitting the entire PD data (before and after drug administration) provided parameter estimates that varied only slightly between different models (e.g. a model estimating the PD and keeping the PK fixed  vs . a joint estimation of PK and PD). The final model is therefore a joint estimation of PK and PD parameters of all data, before and after drug administration. The drug effect was estimated to be very steep, similar to an on/off phenomenon where the maximum drug effect is reached at relatively low concentrations of 10–15 ng ml −1  (the concentration was mostly above that level over 24 h). Variations of the model, with and without Hill coefficient, with some of the parameters fixed to particular values, all estimated a low I C 
 50  parameter. Fixing I C 
 50  to higher values resulted in very large estimates of the Hill coefficient, counterbalancing the (too) large I C 
 50 . The final model included a steepness parameter, the Hill coefficient γ. The final parameter estimates are given in Table  1 . The variability relative to the parameter estimates (%RSE) is generally low with the exception of the parameter P 0 , the initial parasite concentration at time of inoculation, −168 h relative to drug administration. These concentrations were not available and the large variability reflects the observed inter‐individual differences in parasite count and one subject with unusually low parasite growth. The parasite growth, G, as well as the drug specific parameters D, I C 
 50  and γ, show little variability, reflecting the consistent patterns of parasite growth and drug effect (slope of decline). The inter‐individual differences are assigned to different initial parasite counts, confirmed by the data (Figure  2 ). Table 1 Final parameter estimates Parameter Estimate %RSE

 0.558 7 The small additive error term in PK and the associated large %RSE indicated that there might be no additive error for the PK. The low I C 
 50  value in combination with a Hill coefficient above 2 suggested a steep effect curve. Even low drug concentrations achieved effects close to the maximum. In fact, almost all concentrations measured over a 24 h period after dosing were above the I C 
 50  (Figure  1 ), suggesting that the drug effect was basically constant above a certain threshold similar to an on–off effect (Figure  3 ). Figure 3 Concentration–effect curve over the observed range of drug concentration Figure  4  shows the model‐predicted parasite count for a population typical subject and the 80% range together with the observed data on a semi‐logarithmic scale. The initial parasite growth phase becomes apparent as well as the drug effect with a minimum parasite count predicted after approximately 72 h (population typical) and varying between 1 to 5 days. Figure 4 Model visualization PD: observed and model‐predicted parasite count with 10 th  to 90 th  percentile Further model diagnostics are provided in the online supplement. They indicate that the PK and the PD model both fit the data well on population and individual levels. Predictions The PK/PD relationship suggested that the maximum effect was reached over almost the entire 24 h dosing interval such that higher doses or more frequent dosing would not yield larger effects on the parasite count. Further simulations showed that the effect of 300 mg doses once daily would achieve similar efficacy. Figure  5  shows the population typical model‐predicted PK (A) and PD (B) for 1, 2, 3 and 4 doses of 500 mg 451840. It becomes apparent that four (or more) doses are predicted to be needed to achieve cure in a population typical subject. Figure 5 Model‐predicted population typical PK (A) and PD (B) for one to four doses of 500 mg once daily To assess which number of doses would be required to not only lead to a cure for a typical or ‘average’ subject but to estimate how many subjects in a population would be cured, larger populations were simulated from the PK/PD model and the percentages of cure were assessed. Figure  6  shows a simulation of parasite concentration in 500 subjects for one to six doses of 500 mg once daily. The line shows the population typical response and the coloured areas the corresponding 10 to 90% range for one to six doses of 500 mg once daily of 451840. The figure suggests that less than 10% of subjects are predicted to achieve cure with a single dose of 500 mg 451840. For four doses, more than half of the subjects are predicted to reach cure and six doses are required to achieve cure in more than 90% of subjects, typically achieved after approximately 1 week. Figure 6 Simulated parasite concentration, population typical and 80% range for one to six doses of 500 mg once daily Discussion This small clinical trial including eight healthy volunteers experimentally infected with blood stage  P. falciparum  proved to be a highly efficient means of obtaining informative data on the clinical activity of an investigational antimalarial, 451840, never before tested in patients with levels of parasitaemia that cause clinical illness of significant severity. The data obtained enabled modelling of the activity of the drug to derive informative prediction of its curative potential. The experimental conditions of this proof‐of‐concept study following the induced blood stage infection generated high quality data, with the observed PK and PD profiles generally consistent between the different subjects. There was, however, some inter‐individual variability, including one subject in whom parasite growth did not reach the pre‐defined treatment threshold of 1000 parasites ml −1  for treatment. In previous studies  22  significant inter‐individual variability in parasite growth has been observed. This may have an underlying genetic basis, as previously reported  23 . This subject with the parasitaemia below the specified threshold was, however, included in the study, as logistic considerations necessitate that treatment be started simultaneously in all subjects. The decision to include or not include data from this subject in the PK/PD analysis would possibly have an effect on the estimated parasite growth. However, of note, parasite clearance as observed in the slope of the parasite count (supplemental data) was similar in this subject to that of the other study subjects. A single 500 mg dose of 451840 administered with fatty food demonstrated a good antiparasitic effect in all subjects, with a parasite clearance half‐life of 7.7 h. Food effects are not uncommon for antimalarial drugs, e.g. halofantrine  24 . When drug development continues, a new formulation may mimic food effect. The variability observed here is not unusually large. However, the antimalarial effect was insufficiently potent or prolonged to achieve complete parasite clearance in any of the eight subjects. The PK profile of 451840 resembled that previously reported in the phase 1 study  6 , with exposure following a single dose administration of 500 mg of 451840 similar to that observed in non‐infected healthy subjects under fed conditions. Similarly, the PD parameters were estimated with low variability (up to 10%) with the exception of the initial parasite count, P0, reflecting inter‐individual differences in parasite growth. The PK/PD model developed from the study data provided a robust characterization of PK and PD with low variability in parameter estimates, well capturing drug concentrations, parasite growth rate (in the absence of drug), and parasite reduction (drug effect). No severe or serious adverse events were reported at the tested dose of 500 mg of 451840. No AEs were attributed to the drug, and except for nausea attributed to the administration of artemether/lumefantrine, all AEs were attributed to malaria. As has been typically observed in previous human challenge studies  8 ,  15 ,  25 , AEs attributable to malaria were common. These are generally mild and reversible, responding to antipyretics such as paracetamol. The model‐based predictions suggested that six daily doses 451840 dosed at 500 mg daily would be sufficient to achieve cure in more than 90% of subjects. This is similar to cure rates reported with seven daily doses of artesunate monotherapy  17 . The model also suggested that a daily dose of 500 mg elicits close to the maximally achievable effect PD effect, indicating that higher doses or more frequent dosing would not change the overall antiparasitic effect substantially and, further, that lower doses down to 300 mg could achieve similar effects. Potential limitations in the extrapolation to patients include higher parasite concentrations in patients and possibly altered PK and/or PD in presence of malaria. These challenge studies are undertaken in subjects with no history of malaria exposure (past travel to a malarious area was an exclusion criterion). The data were from subjects where no baseline antiparasitic immunity was present. Parasite specific antibodies were first detected about 3 weeks after drug exposure. An advantage of this model was that it provided an estimate of the minimum antiparasitic effect in a non‐immune population and clinical use in a malaria‐endemic area would likely result in a response of a greater magnitude. The bioassay results confirmed those obtained in the previous study  6 , so that the concentration−time profiles of 451840 estimated by bioassay were approximately four times higher compared with those determined by LC–MS/MS. Although the metabolism of 451840 is not well understood, this result suggests the presence of circulating active metabolites in humans  6 . It is notable that, despite the recrudescent parasitaemia observed, treatment with 451840 did not lead to induction of gametocytes, as determined by PCR for the gametocyte‐specific transcript,  pfs25 . This is in contrast to observations made in a previous study with piperaquine  15  in which recrudescent parasitaemia following subcurative therapy was followed by the appearance of gametocytaemia. These observations suggest that 451840 may be active against early stage gametocytes and corroborate  in vitro  data indicating that the drug is active against gametocytes  7 . Activity against transmission stages of the parasite is a desirable characteristic in selection of new antimalarial drugs under consideration for development. Antimalarial drugs with novel mechanisms of action are urgently required to combat the emergence of artemisinin‐resistant parasites. This study based on eight healthy subjects demonstrates that a challenge study can support decision making very early in the development process of a new drug, saving several clinical studies that would have been conducted otherwise. Although single dose treatment with 451840 did not fully provide the desired results, its use in combination deserves further investigation since it represents a class of drugs with a promising new mode of action and has a good tolerability and safety profile.

    <Body>What is Already Known about this Subject 
 Interleukin‐7 (IL‐7) and thymic stromal lymphopoietin share a common receptor component, CD127, and have been implicated in several autoimmune and allergic inflammatory diseases, respectively. IL‐7 signalling may promote the survival, activation and differentiation of lymphocytes. 
 What this Study Adds 
 Single doses of GSK2618960 (0.6 mg kg –1  or 2.0 mg kg –1 ) were well tolerated, increased circulating IL‐7 and soluble CD127, and elicited antidrug antibodies with neutralizing capability, but did not have an impact on lymphocyte populations, inflammatory cytokines or differentiation markers. Drug concentrations required for full  in vivo  receptor occupancy agreed with previous  in vitro  studies. 
 Introduction An increasing body of both preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that raised expression levels of interleukin (IL)‐7 and/or the  IL‐7 receptor  (IL‐7R) are associated with various disease states, including rheumatoid arthritis  1 ,  2 ,  3 , juvenile idiopathic arthritis  4 , spondyloarthritis  5 , psoriasis  6 , primary Sjögren's syndrome  7 ,  8 ,  9 ,  10 , colitis  11 , type 1 diabetes  12 ,  13  and multiple sclerosis  14 ,  15 . Genome‐wide association studies have also identified genetic variations in IL‐7R as a risk factor for some autoimmune diseases  16 ,  17 . IL‐7 is a pleiotropic cytokine that is constitutively produced by stromal cells in nonhaematological tissues (intestinal epithelium, lungs, skin, liver) as well as by lymphoid tissue (thymus and bone marrow), and by lymphatic endothelial cells  18 ,  19 . IL‐7 plays a key role in T cell ontogeny  20  and in the homeostatic maintenance of the peripheral T cell pool  21 . Activation of the IL‐7/IL‐7R pathway in lymphocytes leads to survival (antiapoptotic activity), differentiation of mature naïve and memory T cells, and proliferation  19 . In addition, IL‐7 plays a role in survival and function of innate lymphoid cells, including natural killer cells  22 , lymphoid tissue inducer cells  23  and other diverse cell types  19 . IL‐7 promotes T H 1 and T H 17 effector cell function  8 ,  15 ,  24 ,  25 , and stimulates cytotoxic activity of CD8 +  T cells  26  and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by monocytes  27 . IL‐7 also stimulates peripheral blood mononuclear cells to secrete T cell‐attracting cytokines  9 , and acts via CD4+ T cells and monocytes in co‐culture to augment the activation of B cells  28 . To explore the therapeutic utility of blocking IL‐7 signalling, a humanized Fc‐disabled immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the alpha component (IL‐7Rα; CD127) of the heterodimeric IL‐7R (GSK2618960) was developed. CD127 is also a component of the thymic stromal lymphopoietin receptor (TSLPR) and is required for competent TSLP signalling  29 ,  30 . The TSLPR complex has been associated with a number of allergic inflammatory diseases  30 ,  31 ,  32 . Therefore, GSK2618960 may have the potential to inhibit both pharmacologies and may have utility in autoimmune and allergic inflammatory diseases. Although IL‐7Rα signalling is crucial to most T lymphocytes, regulatory T cells (Treg) exhibit relatively low‐to‐undetectable expression of the receptor  33 . Thus, it was hypothesized that blocking IL‐7R signalling may selectively spare Treg function while exerting inhibitory effects on other potentially pathogenic T cell types, further supporting the rationale as a potential therapeutic target. A first‐in‐human study of single intravenous (IV) infusions of GSK2618960 (ranging from 0.001 mg kg –1  to 0.15 mg kg –1 ) demonstrated favourable safety and tolerability profiles within which no antidrug antibodies (ADAs) were detected (Study I7R116702; NCT01808482)  34 ,  35 . The present study (Study 200 902) assessed the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), target engagement, pharmacodynamics (PD) and immunogenicity of two single ascending doses of GSK2618960 in healthy subjects. Methods Study design This was a phase I randomized, double‐blind (sponsor‐unblind), placebo‐controlled study performed in a single centre in Cambridge, UK, between November 2014 and September 2015. The study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki 2013, and local regulations. The protocol was approved by the local ethics committee (14/LO/1670, National Research Ethics Service Committee, London, UK) and all study subjects provided written informed consent. The study was registered on  Clinicaltrials.gov  (identifier: NCT02293161). Two single ascending dose cohorts (A and B), each consisting of nine healthy subjects, were sequentially randomized (2:1) to receive either GSK2618960 or placebo as a single IV infusion over 1 h. The randomization schedule was generated by the sponsor's clinical statistics department using validated proprietary software. The IV infusion was prepared by pharmacy staff and dispensed in a blinded fashion. Both the active IV infusion and placebo were colourless. Both sentinel and staged dosing were implemented. A dose escalation committee was employed (sponsor unblind: only the central medical monitors were to review unblinded safety data when deemed necessary). The starting dose level of 0.6 mg kg –1  (Cohort A) was a fourfold increase over the highest dose level tested in the first‐in‐human study (I7R116702; see Supporting Information). The dose level of GSK2618960 that was predicted to provide no more than 30 days’ maximal receptor occupancy (RO) was 2.0 mg kg –1  (planned for Cohort B). The no observed adverse effect dose level in the 4‐weekly repeat IV bolus Good Laboratory Practice cynomolgus monkey toxicity study was 300 mg kg –1  (GlaxoSmithKline data on file). Subjects were screened up to 28 days (42 days for those subjects consenting to vaccination) before admission to the clinical unit on day −1 (predose). All subjects remained in the unit for at least 24 h following dosing, and were monitored at least weekly during the period of full RO and then every 4 weeks thereafter until week 24 (in case of latent lymphopenia). Stopping criteria were: a serious adverse event (SAE); a lymphocyte count &lt;0.5 × 10 9  l –1  (sustained for 2 weeks); infusion reactions (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3 or greater) or evidence of immune activation leading to moderate to severe clinical manifestations in one subject administered active treatment; and AEs of moderate or severe intensity (consistent across subjects and reasonably attributable to study drug). The liver stopping criterion was alanine aminotransferase levels ≥3 × the upper limit of normal. Subjects Healthy males or females of nonchildbearing potential, 18–65 years of age with normal laboratory values, body weight ≥50 kg, body mass index 19.0–32.0 kg m –2  and a confirmed positive vaccination status for childhood vaccines (or consent to vaccination) were enrolled. Subjects were excluded if they had a history of a significant disease, had received a live vaccine within 1 month of screening (or were planning to receive a live vaccine within 6 months of completing dosing), or had a history of, or were at high risk for, tuberculosis. Study assessments and procedures Safety and tolerability assessments (co‐primary endpoints) Vital signs, routine haematology, clinical chemistry (including proinflammatory cytokines) and urinalysis (predose, and on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 15, 22, 29, 43, 57, 85, 113, 141 and 169), full physical examination (baseline, and on days 2 and 169), 12‐lead electrocardiogram (ECG) (days 1, 2, 15 and 169), and 24‐h Holter ECG (day 1) were performed; AEs were recorded throughout the study. Virology screening and serology (for vaccination status) were also undertaken and a baseline blood sample for comparative retrospective viral testing was archived in case of symptoms of infection. PK assessments PK profiling of GSK2618960 was conducted on plasma samples using a validated electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA), with a lower limit of quantification of 50 ng ml –1 . PD/biomarker assessments The extent and duration of GSK2618960 target engagement was assessed by evaluating RO on CD3+ T lymphocytes in a whole‐blood flow cytometry assay. Full RO was defined as the occupation of &gt;95% IL‐7Rα molecules on peripheral blood T cells. To assess whether GSK2618960 target engagement effectively blocked IL‐7R signalling, phosphorylation levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) expression in CD3+ CD4+ T cells were assessed by flow cytometry after  ex vivo  incubation of whole blood with exogenous IL‐7 stimulant. Total plasma IL‐7 levels (free and bound to soluble IL‐7Rα) were measured using a validated assay kit (Meso‐Scale Discovery, Rockville, MD, USA; see Supporting Information). Total soluble IL‐7Rα (CD127) levels in the plasma were measured using a validated ECLIA method (Meso Scale Discovery; see Supporting Information). Plasma TSLP levels were measured by a validated Singulex Erenna homogeneous assay format (see Supporting Information). The effect of GSK2618960 on circulating lymphocyte populations was assessed using two approaches: (i) flow cytometry in whole blood: T, CD4 (and CD8), Th1/ Th2/ Th17, Tc1/Tc2/Tc17, cytotoxic T, Treg, naïve T, central and effector memory T, recent thymic emigrants, natural killer and B cells; and (ii) epigenetic quantification of CD3/T H 17, CD3/FoxP3, CD3/TfH and B cells was performed at Epiontis (Berlin, Germany). The effect of GSK2618960 on circulating inflammatory markers was assessed in the plasma: for IL‐17A and IL‐17F, a bead‐based Singulex Erenna immunoassay kit (EMD Millipore, St Charles, MO, USA) was used; for interferon‐ γ (IFN‐γ), IL‐1β, IL‐2, IL‐4, IL‐6, IL‐8, IL‐10, IL‐12p70, IL‐13 and tumour necrosis factor‐α, a validated 10‐plex assay kit (Meso Scale Discovery) was used. Immunogenicity (incidence and titre of ADAs) was assessed on days −1, 15 and 22 (Cohort B), 29, 85 and 169 (week 24) and analysed using a validated bridging ECLIA method (Meso Scale Discovery; see Supporting Information). ADAs were characterized for their neutralizing capability and titre. The titre was defined as the reciprocal of the maximum dilution still yielding a positive response (&gt; the screening cut point). Statistical analysis No formal statistical hypothesis was tested. The sample size of 18 subjects was chosen based on feasibility considerations. The safety population comprised all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug (or partial administration) and was used for assessment of safety, PD/biomarkers and immunogenicity. The PK population comprised all subjects in the safety population for whom ≥80% of the study drug volume was administered and a PK sample was acquired. Plasma GSK2618960 concentration–time data were analysed by noncompartmental methods (WinNonlin 6.3; Certara, Princeton, NJ, USA). A locally weighted regression (locally estimated scatterplot smoothing; LOESS) was used to explore the PK/PD relationship between concentration of GSK2618960 and RO as a  post hoc  analysis. For data analysis, placebo‐treated subjects from each dose cohort were combined as the placebo treatment group ( n  = 6).

There were no deaths or SAEs, and none of the subjects were withdrawn owing to AEs. A total of 54 AEs were reported as either of mild ( n  = 50) or moderate ( n  = 4) intensity, and all resolved prior to study completion without the need for long‐term follow‐up. The most commonly reported AEs were nasopharyngitis (nine subjects) and headache (five subjects), which resolved fully; eight subjects across the three treatment groups used paracetamol as needed. Although nasopharyngitis, headache and conjunctivitis were deemed to be causally related to the study drug (blinded assessment), the frequencies of nasopharyngitis and headache were spread across the three treatment groups (Table  2 ). No trends or clinically significant signals were observed for any of the laboratory parameters, vital signs or ECGs.

In the 0.6 mg kg –1  group, the mean concentration ( n  = 6) at 7 days post‐infusion was 2.05 μg ml –1  (range: 1.46–2.70 μg ml –1 ); at 14 days post‐infusion, the mean value ( n  = 3) was 0.055 μg ml –1  (range: 0–0.14 μg ml –1 ) (three samples were below the limit of quantitation and were set to zero for the calculation). In the 2.0 mg kg –1  group, the mean concentration ( n  = 6) at 14 days and 21 days post‐infusion was 8.14 μg ml –1  (range: 6.08–9.66 μg ml –1 ) and 3.05 μg ml –1  (range: 0.42–5.18 μg ml –1 ), respectively; and 5/6 subjects had a plasma concentration &gt;1 μg ml –1 .

Coloured symbols represent individual subjects Effect of GSK2618960 on the phosphorylation of STAT5 Addition of GSK2618960 to CD3+ CD4+ T cells (prior to dosing, and in the absence of IL‐7) induced the phosphorylation of STAT5 (receptor agonism). The mean of replicate determinations was 6.94% (standard deviation 2.79%) of the maximum achieved with IL‐7 stimulation alone (positive control, 100%) and values were observed in 17/18 subjects (data not shown). There was no change in receptor agonism (as defined by STAT5 phosphorylation) over time (assessed  ex vivo  using exogenous GSK2618960) when comparing baseline samples with those obtained throughout the Cohort B treatment period (samples from Cohort A were not evaluable owing to a procedural technicality – see Supporting Information). Exploratory markers Circulating biomarkers: IL‐7, TSLP and soluble IL‐7Rα (sCD127) Baseline IL‐7 levels ranged from 2.23 pg ml –1  to 26.45 pg ml –1 . In subjects receiving GSK2618960 0.6 mg kg –1 , the mean increase in IL‐7 levels was first detected at 4 h (Figure  5 A) (and by which time full target engagement had already been achieved). IL‐7 concentration reached peak levels during days 2–15, and returned to baseline by day 22. In subjects receiving GSK2618960 2.0 mg kg –1 , IL‐7 concentration reached peak levels during days 2–22 and returned to baseline by day 29 (Figure  5 A). Only four subjects had measurable TSLP levels pre‐ and postdose (range: 9.49–80.55 pg ml –1 ), with no significant change from baseline following dosing (data not shown). Figure 5 Circulating (A) interleukin‐7 (IL‐7) and (B) soluble IL‐7 receptor‐α subunit (CD127) in plasma following a single intravenous infusion of GSK2618960. Mean (± standard deviation) values Figure  5 B illustrates circulating sCD127 levels (free and drug bound) before and after treatment (baseline range: 1.02–8.49 ng ml –1 ). Levels were increased from baseline during days 8–15 and returned to baseline by day 22 in the 0.6 mg kg –1  group, and during days 22–29, with a return to baseline levels by day 43 in the 2.0 mg kg –1  group. Circulating lymphocyte populations Except for B cells (CD45+, CD3−, CD19+), there were no consistent changes in the flow cytometric assessment of either the absolute numbers or percentages in any of the cell lineages in either of the two GSK2618960 or placebo groups from baseline. There was an unexpected, small, transient decrease in circulating B cells across all three treatment groups from baseline to day 8. The mean group absolute values (CD19+ as a percentage of total lymphocytes) at these time points and the change from baseline (± standard deviation) were: placebo, from 13.1% to 11.8% (−1.3 ± 2.1%); 0.6 mg kg –1 , from 10.8% to 8.9% (−1.9 ± 1.2%); and 2.0 mg kg –1 , from 9.5% to 7.1% (−2.5 ± 1.2%). Notably, treatment with GSK2618960 did not appear to change the absolute number of Tregs (CD45+ CD3+ CD4+ CD25high CD127−). CD25 and programmed death‐1 activation markers on selected cell lineages did not change consistently. Epigenetic quantification of cell subtypes corroborated that there were no consistent changes in the specific cell subtypes selected, but that there were small transient unexpected decreases in circulating B cells. Inflammatory markers Proinflammatory cytokine plasma levels measured 4 h postdose did not indicate an effect of GSK2618960 on cytokine releas e. IL ‐8 was increased at apparently random time points in some subjects, as was IFN‐γ. Throughout the study, there were no consistent changes from baseline in either of the T cell differentiation markers (IL‐17A or IL‐17F) or in the other cytokines measured (levels remained undetectable). Immunogenicity Five of six subjects receiving GSK2618960 0.6 mg kg –1  developed ADAs (titre range: 4–2560) and all six subjects receiving GSK2618960 2.0 mg kg –1  developed ADAs (titre range: 4–5120). Among the ADA‐positive subjects, 2/5 subjects receiving GSK2618960 0.6 mg kg developed NAbs (titre range: 2–10) and 5/6 subjects receiving GSK2618960 2.0 mg kg –1  had NAbs (titre range: 4–40). ADAs were persistent to day 169. Discussion There were neither safety nor tolerability concerns following a 1‐h IV infusion of either a single 0.6 mg kg –1  or 2.0 mg kg –1  dose of GSK2618960 in healthy subjects. From both a safety and mechanistic viewpoint, there was neither a short‐ nor long‐term impact on T‐lymphocyte counts or subpopulations throughout the 24‐week study period. There was an unexpected transient small decrease in B cells that could not easily be explained but may have been due to a redistribution phenomenon. Overall, there were no meaningful changes to inflammatory cytokines or differentiation markers (e.g. IL‐17A and IL‐17F). GSK2618960 successfully blocked IL‐7R signalling above the threshold concentration (1 μg ml –1 ) required for full target engagement, as evidenced by total inhibition of STAT5 phosphorylation (in an  ex vivo  assay), and this corroborated previous  in vitro  findings (data on file). Thus, GSK2618960 may prove effective in modulating the autoinflammatory activity of pathogenic T cells in localized diseased tissue (e.g. salivary glands in patients with Sjögren's syndrome). These observations are in agreement with a PK/PD study reported by Kern  et al . in cynomolgus monkeys  38 , showing that treatment with an IL‐7Rα mAb prevents the ability of IL‐7 to initiate downstream signalling proximal from the IL‐7R, as evidenced by inhibition of STAT5 phosphorylation. Importantly, GSK2618960 inhibited IL‐7‐induced phosphorylation of STAT5 in a manner that was in concordance with drug exposure, target engagement and its proposed mechanism of action. The duration at which GSK2618960 exposures were maintained ( in vivo ) above the  in vitro  ‘threshold’ of 1 μg ml –1  concentration and the understanding of consequential drug PD were central to both the study rationale and to the importance of defining a starting dose and regimen for future clinical studies in patients. The actual duration of exposure above the threshold concentration believed to achieve full RO was 7 days and 21 days (0.6 mg kg –1  and 2.0 mg kg –1  doses, respectively), which was shorter than originally predicted (11 days and 30 days). The half‐life of the 0.6 mg kg –1  and 2.0 mg kg –1  single doses administered by IV infusion was 57.4 (±7.6) and 123.0 (±26.8) h, respectively, which is relatively short when compared with that of a typical mAb against soluble targets (21 days)  39 . Clearance by target‐mediated drug disposition (TMDD) provides an additional, but saturable, clearance pathway for some antibodies  40 . Thus, it appears that the level of target expression and, consequently, the extent of TMDD were higher than originally anticipated. Despite the low level of target, the TMDD phenomena can still play a relevant role in explaining nonlinear PK, and this is mainly because of the high turnover of the target that contributes to the saturable elimination of the antibody. The decreased clearance rate of GSK2618960 at the higher dose level would support this. Target engagement (&gt;95% RO) was achieved at a threshold concentration of &gt;1 μg ml –1 , which corroborated the  in vivo  PK and target engagement findings. The relationship between PK and RO is illustrated in Figure  6 
 ,  with the fitted LOESS curve superimposed. As was expected, the extent of duration of target engagement (RO) correlated with the inhibition of phosphorylation of STAT5.

Coloured symbols represent individual subjects. The vertical line represents the lower limit of quantification (50 ng ml –1 ). BLQ, below the lower limit of quantification Although ADAs had not been observed in the first‐in‐human study (I7R116702; dose levels 0.001–0.15 mg kg –1 )  34 ,  35 , ADAs were first observed in 5/6 subjects administered a single IV infusion of GSK2618960 0.6 mg kg –1 , and in all six subjects administered GSK2618960 2.0 mg kg –1 , with higher titres generated in Cohort B (2.0 mg kg –1  dose) compared with Cohort A (0.6 mg kg –1  dose) suggesting a dose‐response relationship. Of note is that one subject generated a high titre (5120) by week 12 (assessed in the absence of circulating GSK2618960 and based on the titration results during method validation). Subjects who developed high and persistent titres of ADAs (7/12 across both cohorts) also developed NAbs). Furthermore, GSK2618960‐specific memory B cells were detected in a B cell enzyme‐linked immunospot assay (data not shown). Memory B cell activity developed as early as day 29, and was observed in all of those subjects who had developed ADAs by day 169. The frequency of such events seemed to be dose dependent. Following completion of Study 200 902, antidrug antibodies were observed in the 6‐month cynomolgus monkey study. ADAs to humanized antibodies are not unexpected in nonhuman primates and do not usually prevent progression to clinical development. It was noted that the results of clinical trial NCT02045732 (an anti‐IL7R mAb) listed that 3/3 subjects administered 0.25 mg kg –1  PF‐06342674 developed ADAs  41 . Expression of target IL‐7 receptor on antigen presenting cells may increase the potential for immunogenicity, but there is no direct evidence. Host‐, disease‐ and product‐specific factors are known to influence immunogenicity – e.g. amino acid sequence, number and strength of T cell epitopes, post‐translational modification, structural alterations (aggregation, oxidation, deamidation, degradation), storage conditions, production and purification processes  42 . GSK2618960 exhibited a degree of (paradoxical) agonistic potential in the present study (assessed  ex vivo ), which corroborated a previous observation in the first‐in‐human study, I7R116702  34 ,  35 . Agonistic activity could be exacerbated  in vivo  by an ADA response mediating crosslinking. However, the data indicated that there was no change to baseline agonism levels following a single‐dose IV infusion. Further evaluation of any impact of this phenomenon, using an optimized assay, could be incorporated into repeat‐dose studies in patients. It was envisaged that the binding of GSK2618960 to both sCD127 and membrane IL‐7Rα subunit (CD127) would set up a dynamic equilibrium – firstly, by preventing the binding of IL‐7 to both forms of the receptor and, secondly, by reducing IL‐7 clearance through receptor‐mediated internalization. Given that IL‐7 is constitutively expressed  43 ,  44 , such a dynamic equilibrium might manifest as an increase in circulating levels of IL‐7 to a new threshold level. Indeed, the marked increase in the level of IL‐7 from baseline, the duration of that increase, and the onset and rate of decline were in concordance with drug dose, exposure and RO. These data indicate that GSK2618960 blocked clearance of IL‐7 through inhibition of receptor‐mediated internalization. Understanding the longer‐term impact of this (if any) will require repeat dose studies. Similarly, sCD127 was speculated to increase upon complexing with GSK2618960 and have prolonged clearance until the complex was metabolized/excreted. Irrespective of the GSK2618960 dose, the rate of accumulation of sCD127 was slower than that of IL‐7 (increased levels of sCD127 only became apparent on day 2). Administration of the higher dose of GSK2618960 (2.0 mg kg –1 
 vs . 0.6 mg kg –1 ) and, consequentially, higher exposure, resulted in a relatively higher and longer duration of increase in circulating sCD127, as predicted. These data suggest that sCD127 (like IL‐7) accumulates upon engagement of IL‐7Rα by GSK2618960 and declines upon drug clearance. Circulating low TSLP concentrations were apparently unaffected following a single infusion of GSK2618960 at either dose level, which seemed to corroborate the notion that the binding of TSLP to its cognate heterodimeric receptor [cytokine receptor‐like factor 2 (CLFR2)] would be unlikely to be affected by GSK2618960, at least after a single infusion in the short term. The main limitation of the present study was the inability to determine whether ADAs had an impact on GSK2618960 clearance. IgG antibodies, such as GSK2618960, typically have a half‐life of 21 days  39 , which is unfortunately coincidental with the first experimental detection of ADAs, and so did not enable the determination of whether emergent ADAs had affected the extent and duration of drug exposure/clearance. Interpretation of PK data was yet further confounded by the single and relatively low dose levels tested and whereby TMDD was rationally believed to have shortened the half‐life. It is known that ADAs not only have the potential to increase the overall clearance rate, but also may interfere with the detection of free drug levels in PK assays  45 . Further repeat‐dose clinical studies will be required to evaluate the impact of ADAs on GSK2618960 clearance. To conclude, GSK2618960 was well tolerated when administered to healthy subjects as a single IV infusion at a dose capable of maintaining effective receptor blockade for up to 21 days. There were no SAEs, and no meaningful changes were observed in any haematological or immune cell populations or in the selected cytokine profiles. Single doses of GSK2618960 elicited ADAs with high incidence and persistent titres, and there was evidence of neutralizing capability. TMDD appeared to shorten the half‐life of GSK2618960 as compared with a typical IgG antibody. There was a clear PK/PD relationship between the duration of GSK2618960 exposure above the threshold concentration required to have an impact on important measures, such as the extent and duration of target engagement, and such PD measures as the extent and duration of inhibition of STAT5 phosphorylation and the duration of the increased levels of circulating IL‐7 and sCD127. Further repeat‐dose studies are warranted in patients, to properly assess the potential of GSK2618960 to have an impact on T cells and other cell populations in inflamed tissues and to evaluate any clinical improvement.

 What is already known about this subject 
 Poor statin adherence remains a prevalent challenge in patients with coronary heart disease associated with adverse outcomes. Objective methods, feasible for use in clinical practice and future research, allowing detection of poor atorvastatin adherence in spot blood samples, have previously not been described. 
 
 What this study adds 
 Suggested dose‐normalized cut‐off values allowing discrimination among adherence and partial adherence to atorvastatin treatment in patients with coronary heart disease. A cut‐off value to identify nonadherent patients (&gt;3 daily doses omitted) is also proposed. The proposed method may be used to identify patients at‐risk of future statin discontinuation and promote communication about adherence and side‐effects. In turn, this may improve lipid management. The methodological approach may also translate to other drugs administered in chronic diseases. 
 1 INTRODUCTION Poor adherence to statin treatment is a prevalent challenge in cardiovascular disease prevention, 1 ,  2 ,  3  associated with adverse outcomes. 4 ,  5 ,  6  Regular assessment of adherence is recommended by the European lipid guideline from 2016, 7  and was recently given a class IA recommendation in the corresponding US guideline. 8  Adherence has traditionally been monitored by indirect methods such as clinical judgement, self‐reports or pill counts, methods that are prone to misinterpretation and overestimation of actual intake. 9  Prescription fill rates obtained from pharmacy registries provides the most comprehensive data on statin adherence today. 9 ,  10  However, registry data is not feasible for documentation of statin intake in the individual patient. For statins, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol is an objective marker that might be used to monitor adherence. However, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction secondary to statin therapy has been shown to vary from 5 to 70% between persons across all statin classes and doses. 11  Hence, objective methods to detect reduced adherence are requested 12  for the determination of true statin adherence in clinical practice. Measurements of the active drug and/or its metabolites or directly observed therapy (DOT) are examples of objective methods for the assessment of drug adherence. 9  Assays for measuring statins and metabolites in blood with direct chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) methods have been described. 13 ,  14 ,  15 ,  16 ,  17  However, they are generally designed for studies on pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence. 13 ,  14 ,  15 ,  16 ,  17  We have recently reported a fast and reliable assay for the quantification of atorvastatin and its 5 major metabolites with LC–MS/MS methodology. 18  Importantly, this assay is feasible for the routine clinical laboratory with respect to technical implementation and interpretation of adherence. 18 
 Atorvastatin is the most frequently used statin for the prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) in Europe 19  and Norway. 20  Algorithms to allow discrimination among complete adherence, partial adherence and nonadherence to atorvastatin treatment, assessed by objective methods, have not yet been developed. Such algorithms may allow identification of patients at‐risk of future treatment discontinuation and thus in need of closer follow‐up. To be able to monitor adherence, a drug exposure variable with strong correlation to the ingested dose is required. Atorvastatin is converted to hydroxyl and lactone metabolites  in vivo . CYP3A4 is primarily responsible for the hydroxylations 21  and the enzyme activity shows high variability between individuals. 22  Accordingly, the variability of atorvastatin metabolism needs to be levelled out in the context of a reliable drug exposure variable. The sum of atorvastatin and its major primary metabolites accounts for the major pharmacokinetic variability of this drug. 23 
 We aimed to develop an objective drug exposure variable, reflecting the administered atorvastatin dose, with the ability to discriminate among adherence, partial adherence and nonadherence to atorvastatin therapy in CHD patients. We hypothesized, based on the reported half‐life of atorvastatin in blood, 23  that adherence could be discriminated from partial adherence after the dose had been omitted for 1 to 3 days. 2 METHODS 2.1 Design and patient characteristics Twenty‐five adult CHD patients treated with atorvastatin 10 mg ( n =  5), 20 mg ( n =  6), 40 mg ( n =  7) and 80 mg ( n  = 7) were included in a clinical pharmacokinetic adherence study conducted from January to February 2018. Patients were recruited from the outpatient clinic at Drammen Hospital, Norway. A prerequisite for participation was no CHD events for 2 years prior to study participation and no present symptoms of unstable CHD. The exclusion criteria were medical or technical complications of blood sampling and difficulties collaborating with the study protocol. Patients were consecutively assigned to either the test or control group. One patient who did not comply with the study protocol was excluded, leaving 24 patients eligible for the analyses. A study flow chart is shown in Figure  S1 . 2.2 Test procedure Prior to inclusion, all patients participated in a 2‐hour meeting with the study physicians where the background for the study and practical implementation was thoroughly explained. All patients were instructed to administer their atorvastatin dose between 7 and 10 AM once daily for at least 7 days prior to study start to ensure steady‐state drug concentrations. On the first study day, all patients participated in a DOT study without having taken their morning dose. Blood samples were collected 1 hour before DOT (t −1 ) and immediately before DOT (t 0 ) to detect any unscheduled morning dose. Atorvastatin was then administered under observation by the study nurse and blood samples were collected 1 and 3 hours later in all patients. After the DOT study, half of the patients constituting the  control group  were not followed up further, whereas the  test group , were instructed to stop taking atorvastatin and return for blood sampling after 24 (t 24 ), 48 (t 48 ), 72 (t 72 ) and 96 (t 96 ) hours. To provide data on drug and metabolite concentrations in patients with escape intake just prior to blood sampling, the test group also participated in a second DOT‐study with blood sample collections 1 and 2 hours after atorvastatin administration (day 4, t 1  and t 2 ). 2.3 Study assessments 2.3.1 Assessment of atorvastatin and metabolites Venous blood was sampled in EDTA vacutainers and handled according to both a low‐temperature procedure and an ambient‐temperature procedure as previously described. 18  The resulting plasma samples were analysed for the acid and lactone form of atorvastatin (parent drug), ortho‐ (2‐OH) and para‐ (4‐OH) hydroxyl atorvastatin with a 2‐channel LC–MS/MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at Oslo University Hospital. We have previously reported that the preanalytical stability of the acid forms are acceptable for 1 week at ambient and cool temperature, while the lactone forms demonstrate acceptable preanalytical stability for 3 hours at cool temperature (2–8°C). 18  Due to the in‐sample conversions of the lactone forms to acids, we examined the sums of acid and corresponding lactone as this ensures stability of the drug concentration when samples are kept in ambient temperature for 6 days. 18 
 Preset conditions for the alignment of optimal cut‐off limits were: (i) to avoid that adherent patients are misclassified as partially adherent, a maximum of 1 day without drug intake was allowed; (ii) the cut‐off between adherence and partial adherence aimed to indicate at least 2 days without drug intake; and (iii) the cut‐off between partial and nonadherence aimed to indicate that &gt;3 daily doses had been omitted. The sum of parent drug and the metabolites were evaluated as test variables to differentiate among adherence and partial adherence. Additionally, we assessed ratios between the parent drug and individual metabolites to compare the ability to discriminate partial adherence. The lower limit of detection is set by a signal‐to‐noise ratio at 3 for the analyte. Since the concentration related to this limit will vary between samples, methods and laboratories it is unsuitable as a standardized cut‐off limit for nonadherence. Therefore, a concentration threshold set at approximately 3‐fold the lower limit of detection was defined for each substance (metabolite). The instrument response (i.e. analyte/internal standard ratio) corresponding to these standardized concentration‐based thresholds were investigated as potential discriminators between partial and nonadherence. The individual half‐lives were calculated for the parent drug and each metabolite in the test group, assuming first order kinetics and using linear regression of the Ln‐transformed concentrations against time at t 24 , t 48 , and t 72 . All test group patients were then simulated on each dose level, and the time to reach the lower concentration threshold was estimated for each substance, using the slope and intercept of the equations obtained by linear regression. The discriminating performance of the nonadherence limits will depend both on the pharmacokinetic characteristics and the analytical sensitivity of the method for the individual substance. Accordingly, the metabolite with superior ability to separate nonadherence from partial adherence could be identified. In order to explain potential large deviations in drug or metabolite concentrations, we analysed relevant sequence variants in the  SLCO1B1 (c521T &gt; C),  CYP3A4  (*22) and  CYP3A5  (*3) genes using real‐time polymerase chain reaction amplification with hybridization probes and melt curve analysis (LightCycler 480, Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany). 2.3.2 Clinical data Demographic and clinical covariates were obtained from hospital medical records, from a self‐report questionnaire and a clinical examination completed at the first study visit. Study data included: age, sex, body weight and height, somatic comorbidities, food intake prior to drug administration, perceived statin‐associated muscle symptoms, concurrent medication, and intake of grapefruit, St John's wort and red‐yeast rice. Routine analysis of creatine kinase, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, c‐reactive protein and albumin were performed on a clinical chemistry analyser (Architect ci16200, Abbot Laboratories, Abbot Park, IL, USA). 2.4 Ethics and safety The study was conducted in accordance to the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and in consistence with ICH/Good Clinical Practice. The study protocol was reviewed by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics without remarks and approved by the local Data Protection Officer (16/00117–107). The Norwegian Medicines Agency did not define the study as a clinical trial requiring approval since the main purpose was not to ascertain or verify/compare the efficacy or safety of atorvastatin. All patients gave a written informed consent to participate prior to study start. 2.5 Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 25. The Student  t  test was applied to assess differences in means (standard deviation) between the control and test group for continuous variables. The Fisher mid‐ P  test was used for categorical variables. 24  Atorvastatin pharmacokinetic variables were assessed with the Mann–Whitney  U  test for unrelated samples, and the Wilcoxon signed rank test for paired samples. Correlations of parent drug and metabolites  vs  atorvastatin dose were assessed using Spearman's rank correlation. Linear regression analyses were applied to explore the associations between clinical and demographic variables and dose‐adjusted atorvastatin and metabolite concentrations. Cut‐off values for partial nonadherence were obtained with receiver operating characteristics curves at the different time intervals without dosing in the test group as compared to the completely adherent control group. 3 RESULTS Adherence at baseline was demonstrated with no significant differences in dose‐normalized concentrations of atorvastatin plus metabolites immediately before DOT and 24 hours after DOT (median 0.46  vs  0.47 [nmol/L]/mg,  P =  .39). The demographic and clinical characteristics were comparable between the test group and the control group (Table  1 ).

The following half‐lives (median, range) were calculated in the test group: atorvastatin acid 14 (11–24) hours, atorvastatin lactone 13 (10–20) hours, 2‐OH atorvastatin acid 15 (12–48) hours, 2‐OH atorvastatin lactone 15 (11–37) hours, 4‐OH atorvastatin acid 21 (14–42) hours and 4‐OH atorvastatin lactone 19 (13–40) hours. The sum of parent drug and all metabolites in blood samples handled by the ambient temperature procedure was mean 94% (range 77–130%, 95% CI 89–99%) compared to samples handled at cold temperature at t 0  and mean 96% (range 69–150%, 95% CI 81–111%) at t 96 . All measurements of parent drug and metabolites were above the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) when patients were adherent to dose before DOT and 24 hours after DOT. Fifteen percent of the measurements were below LLOQ when doses were omitted in the test group. 3.1 The relationship between atorvastatin dose and exposure Correlations between the different drug exposure variables and the atorvastatin dose are shown in Table  2 . There was a positive correlation between all individual analytes and the dose. The parent drug was numerically weaker correlated than the parent drug plus metabolites exposure.

Sex, body weight, renal function, food intake prior to drug administration and perceived statin side effects were not associated with significant variations in atorvastatin and metabolites concentrations at t 0 . Compared with patients expressing the wild types, the mean dose‐normalized t 0  concentration sum of atorvastatin acid plus all metabolites were not statistically different in patients expressing variants in  SLCO1B1  ( n  = 7),  CYP3A4  ( n  = 2) or  CYP3A5  ( n  = 3): 0.36  vs  0.49 nM/mg, 0.55  vs  0.44 nM/mg, 0.43  vs  0.46 nM/mg, respectively. 3.3 Identification of patients with partial adherence When the test group had omitted tablet intake for 3 days, all the individual dose‐normalized sums of atorvastatin plus 5 metabolites (6‐component sum) were separated from the corresponding sums in the controls, i.e. discriminated at 0.20 nM/mg for samples handled at low temperature and at 0.18 nM/mg for samples handled at ambient temperature (Figure  1 ). For this 6‐component sum, the receiver operating characteristics curve analysis with cut‐off at 0.10 nM/mg provided 100% sensitivity and 92% specificity for the identification of partial adherence when 2 or 3 doses were omitted, regardless of the preanalytical sample handling procedure (Table  3 ).

The discriminator represents the dose‐normalized sum of concentrations. Low and ambient refer to the temperature during the preanalytical sample handling. ATV, atorvastatin The dose‐normalized sum of the acid and lactone form of the parent drug (2‐component sum) was also assessed, and the respective groups where entirely separated at 0.070 nM/mg after the test group had omitted 2 doses (Figure  2 ). A cut‐off at 0.050 nM/mg thus provided 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity for the identification of partial adherence when 2 or 3 doses were omitted, regardless of sample handling procedure (Table  3 ). Ratios between the acid plus lactone form of atorvastatin and 2‐OH atorvastatin, as well as ratios between the acid plus lactone form of atorvastatin and 4‐OH atorvastatin, discriminated less adequately between adherence and partial adherence (data not shown).

Note: dotted line represents the suggested cut‐off for partial nonadherence at 0.05 nM/mg. Blue and red boxes show samples handled in low and ambient temperature, respectively. Dots represent a single outlier patient 3.4 Identification of nonadherence The metabolite 2‐OH atorvastatin acid (1‐component), with instrument response corresponding to a standardized concentration threshold at 0.014 nmol/L, showed superior ability to distinguish nonadherence (omitting dose for &gt;3 days) from partial adherence. The time to reach this threshold, after cessation of drug intake, was median 3.8 (range 2.2–14) days at 10 mg, 4.3 (2.8–16) days at 20 mg, 5.0 (3.3–18) days at 40 mg, and 5.6 (3.8–20) days at 80 mg. These pharmacokinetic simulations were based on linear regression with R 2  at median 0.988 (0.866–1.000). With 2‐OH atorvastatin acid below 0.014 nmol/L, 100% were correctly classified as nonadherent at the 40‐ and 80‐mg dose levels, and 83% at the 10‐ and 20‐mg dose levels (17% misclassified as nonadherent when being partially adherent). 3.5 Identification of an unscheduled dose prior to blood sampling The maximum dose‐normalized 2‐component sum at t 0  in the pooled control and test group was 0.40 (cold temperature) and 0.36 (ambient temperature) nM/mg. The corresponding mean concentration after the second DOT study was 1.74 (range 0.03–5.61) nM/mg at day 4, t 1  and 2.21 (range 0.09–5.64) nM/mg at day 4, t 2 . At day 4, t 1  and t 2 , respectively, 33% and 17% of the test group were below 0.40 nM/mg. 4 DISCUSSION To our knowledge, this is the first study to present a test procedure with cut‐off values that allow discrimination among adherence, partial adherence and nonadherence to atorvastatin therapy, based on LC–MS/MS measurements of plasma drug concentrations. By the present analysis and algorithm, patients at risk for permanent statin discontinuation may be evaluated directly, by a single blood test at expected steady state, with regard to statin adherence. There is no consensus with regards to the definition of adherence, partial adherence and nonadherence in the statin literature. 7 ,  9 ,  12  Indeed, this also applies for objective methods to monitor other cardiovascular drugs. Accordingly, the present methodological approach may also translate to determine the adherence to other drugs administered in chronic diseases. To our knowledge, only 1 previous study has applied an LC–MS/MS assay in clinical blood samples to determine adherence to atorvastatin. 25  A dichotomous classification of adherence based on atorvastatin blood concentration over or under the LLOQ was used. 25 
 Our adherence algorithm classifies adherence, partial adherence and nonadherence. With the chosen drug exposure variable and cut‐off, partial adherence implies that the dose is omitted for up to 3 days. A 6‐component sum (dose‐normalized atorvastatin acid plus all metabolites) &lt;0.10 nM/mg provides 100% sensitivity and 92% specificity when 2 or 3 doses are omitted. Forty‐two percent will be classified with partial adherence if a single dose is omitted (Figure  1 ). This cut‐off was selected as a practical approach to minimize the risk of classifying adherent patients as partially adherent and to reduce the effect of a single apparent outlier in the data set. Standardized conditions for blood sampling are important to ensure the given diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. Thus, we recommend blood sampling just prior to the next scheduled dose, i.e. trough concentration. We also present an alternative approach to classify partial adherence, by using a 2‐component sum (dose‐normalized atorvastatin acid plus lactone). A cut‐off at &lt;0.05 nM/mg provides 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity when 2 or 3 doses are omitted, due to the faster elimination of these substances. However, more patients (i.e. 75–83%) will be classified with partial adherence by the 2‐component sum when a single dose is omitted (Figure  2 ). The significance of omitting a single dose only for the evaluation of adherence is debatable, and partial adherence was intended to indicate 2–3 days without drug intake. Partial adherence will thus be slightly more severe and optimally classified by the 6‐component model, according to the aims for the method. This gain needs to be balanced towards the simpler and less expensive 2‐component model. The correlation to the given dose was higher for the 6‐component sum, and the 2‐component model may be more prone to variations in drug metabolism. A similar effect can be assumed for interacting drugs, not examined in the present study. Further studies will confirm the optimal method to distinguish adherence and partial adherence. The categorization of nonadherence solely on the basis of nondetectable  vs  detectable drug levels in blood has important limitations with respect to standardization. In general, the lower limit of detection is below the quantitative range, and it is dependent on factors displaying variability within and between laboratories (i.e. methodological conditions, sample composition and LC–MS/MS instrument sensitivity). It would not be possible to standardize terms such as nonadherence, poor adherence or low adherence with respect to time intervals without dosing, if a nondetectable drug level is the only criterion for classification. Our concept allows nonadherence to be defined in terms of a minimum time interval omitting dosing. Thus, we suggest a standardized lower concentration‐based threshold as cut‐off to identify nonadherent patients. Since this concentration is below the LLOQ, our practical approach is to apply the instrument response (analyte/internal standard ratio) that corresponds to this lower concentration threshold. Although measurements above the LLOQ would be optimal for any purpose, the semiquantitative approach allows interpretations in relation to days without dosing, and the internal standard adjustment allows correction for matrix effects between samples and other methodological fluctuations. The specific nonadherence threshold was elucidated with samples handled according to the low‐temperature procedure, and 2‐OH atorvastatin acid &lt;0.014 nmol/L demonstrated to be the optimal discriminator for nonadherence (corresponding to &gt;3 consecutive days without dosing). Nevertheless, this 1‐component model should also be applicable when the ambient temperature sample handling procedure is applied, although the misclassification as partially adherent then may be increased due to the preanalytical lactone‐to‐acid conversion. Due to the semiquantitative nature of the nonadherence cut‐off, its accuracy was estimated with the proportion of correctly classified patients (100% at 40 and 80 mg, and 83% at 10 and 20 mg). The clinical relevance of the nonadherence cut‐off, and also the relevance of differentiation between partial adherence and nonadherence, should be validated in a larger clinical study. The preanalytical procedures are simplified by using the sum of acid and lactone forms, allowing blood samples to be handled in ambient temperature. 18  In the present study, we demonstrate that the proposed cut‐offs are equal for samples handled at ambient temperature, a major advantage for the potential use of the test in routine clinical practice. The 6‐component sum correlated well with the administered dose at steady state, suggesting this would be a representative drug exposure variable with the benefit of levelling out within‐ and between‐individual variations in drug metabolism. 22 
 Increasing age was associated with higher dose‐normalized blood concentrations of both parent drug and metabolites, a finding supported by previous studies examining factors associated with variations in atorvastatin concentrations. 26 ,  27  Due to the limited sample size, we did not attempt to age adjust the drug exposure variable, but this should be considered in a larger cohort. The recent emergence of new, expensive drugs targeting subclinical inflammation 28  and lowering lipids, 29  emphasizes the need to improve adherence to the cost‐effective statins. Knowledge about the prevalence of execution issues (i.e. omitting doses) was strongly requested in a recent position paper from the European Society of Cardiology. 30  Our new direct method combined with the algorithms developed in the present study can be used in future studies to differentiate and describe the prevalence of adherence, partial adherence and nonadherence to atorvastatin therapy. When combined with clinical data, causes of partial and nonadherence to atorvastatin therapy may be revealed to develop new approaches for improving adherence. Measurement of plasma drug levels revealed that nonadherence was common in patients with apparent treatment resistant hypertension in 2 recent studies. 31 ,  32  Data from a pilot study in patients with low or undetectable blood levels of blood pressure‐lowering drugs indicated that confronting these patients with the study results, improved adherence and reduced average blood pressure with &gt;15 mmHg. 33  Thus, a test for atorvastatin adherence may enhance the clinicians' awareness at follow‐up visits and encourage communication about adherence between physician and patient. 4.1 Limitations Due to the limited sample size there is a risk of bias and spurious results when multiple‐adjusted analyses are performed. Hence, patient factors besides age may be associated with variations in drug or metabolites exposure. The suggested cut‐off values should therefore be validated, and potentially adjusted, in a larger data set including more patients with multiple comorbidities, interacting drugs and genetic variations that may influence the statin pharmacokinetics. The present methodology should also be cross‐validated with other adherence assessment methods. Patients with extremely high or low atorvastatin or metabolite concentrations could potentially be misclassified with the suggested algorithms. Further knowledge may guide the interpretation of the test when risk factors for misclassification are present. Even though we identified a cut‐off that allows detection of escape dose intake 1 or 2 hours prior to blood sampling in a majority (i.e. 67 and 83%, respectively) of the partially adherent patients, the risk of white coat adherence is not eliminated. 9  Finally, concentrations below the LLOQ were used, although it brings along uncertainty. Achievement of a lower LLOQ should be addressed in future improvement of the methodology. 5 CONCLUSION Cut‐off values based on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin and metabolites in spot blood samples, allowing discrimination among adherence, partial and nonadherence to atorvastatin therapy in CHD patients have been developed. The present direct method to determine atorvastatin adherence may optimize the use of cost‐effective statins in clinical practice to improve lipid management and clinical outcomes.

    <Body>What is Already Known about this Subject 
 Polypharmacy is increasingly common in older adults in the UK. Older adults are vulnerable to medication‐related problems during transitions of care from hospital into the community. 
 What this Study Adds 
 Medication‐related harm affects one in three older adults following hospital discharge, of which at least 10% is preventable. Non‐adherence is implicated in one quarter of cases of medication harm. The cost to the NHS of postdischarge medication harm in older adults is estimated at £396 million, of which over 90% is attributable to hospital readmissions. 
 Introduction Harm from medicines is a common cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in patients worldwide  1 . The European Medicines Agency describes adverse drug reactions (ADRs) as ‘a response to a medicinal product that is noxious and unintended’  2 . In England, between 2008 and 2015, emergency hospital admissions due to ADRs increased by 53%, from 60 055 to 92 114  3 . Based on data from a major UK study conducted in 2002  4 , the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) estimated an annual cost to the National Health Service (NHS) in 2015 of £530 million from preventable ADR‐related hospital admissions  5 . Older people are highly susceptible to harm from medicines, due to polypharmacy and ageing‐related changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics  6 ,  7 . Furthermore, non‐adherence to medicines for chronic disease was found in 30% of participants (median age 67 years) in one UK study  8 . Non‐adherence to medicine is strongly associated with poor health outcomes  9 , including mortality  10 , and high healthcare costs  11 . A systematic review found that 16% of community‐dwelling older adults experience harm from their medicines at any one time, compared with 5% of younger adults  12 . The transition period from hospital to home following hospital discharge has rarely been explored, despite the vulnerability of patients to medication problems during this period. For instance, patients often experience medication changes  13  with limited involvement in these decisions  14 . Provision of information about possible side effects can be poor  15 , and communication is often lacking between secondary and primary care  16 . Furthermore, this is a time of heightened physiological stress for patients, due to the lingering impact of acute illness and deconditioning from their hospital stay  17 . In England, medication‐related harm (MRH) in the postdischarge period has not been studied in an older population. The aims of the present study were: (i) to determine the incidence, severity and preventability of MRH postdischarge in older adults; (ii) to describe the main types of MRH and implicated drugs; (iii) to describe health service utilization and cost associated with MRH. Methods The study was approved by the National Research Ethics Service, East of England (REC Reference 13/EE/0075). Design, setting and participants Detailed methods for the study have been published previously  18 . In brief, this multicentre, prospective cohort study recruited adults aged 65 years and over. Between September 2013 and November 2015, research nurses invited patients to participate from medical wards in five NHS teaching hospitals in Southern England, near to the time of hospital discharge. The nurses collected baseline information, including demographic, clinical and social data, from consenting patients. Senior, trained research pharmacists followed discharged participants for 8 weeks to determine if they experienced MRH. An 8‐week observation period was chosen as previous research outside of the UK has shown that this is a reasonable time frame for capturing most postdischarge MRH events  19 ,  20 ,  21 . We excluded patients if they were terminally ill, lacked capacity and had no nominated consultee, or were transferred to other acute healthcare units. MRH assessment We defined MRH as an ADR or harm arising from a failure to receive medication owing to non‐adherence. Harm arising from medication error was included where reported. Intentional overdose was excluded. This is a modified version of the definition by Strand  et al .  22 . A medicine was defined by its inclusion in the World Health Organization–Anatomical Therapeutics Coding (WHO‐ATC) system  23 . We determined MRH incidence using three sources of follow‐up information: (i) participant and/or carer telephone interview at 8 weeks, using a structured questionnaire; (ii) general practitioner (GP) records; and (iii) prospective review of hospital readmissions, in consultation with the admitting medical consultant. If an ADR was suspected, the validated Naranjo algorithm  24  was used to assess causality, in conjunction with the British National Formulary and Summary of Product Characteristics. For MRH associated with non‐adherence to medicine, we used a modified version of a validated questionnaire to assess participant non‐adherence  25 . We classified events as ‘possible’, ‘probable’ or ‘definite’ MRH, or ‘doubtful’ when no harm occurred  26 ,  27 ,  28 . We graded severity of MRH using the approach of Morimoto  et al .  29 : fatal, life‐threatening, serious (requires therapy change and/or treatment by a health professional) and significant. The preventability of MRH was assessed using the criteria of Hallas  et al .  30 : ‘definitely preventable’ (treatment inconsistent with best practice or unrealistic), ‘possibly preventable’ (preventable with efforts exceeding obligatory clinical demands), ‘not preventable’, or ‘not able to evaluate’. Two senior study pharmacists provided case‐based training to research pharmacists involved in data collection at all participating sites, to optimize the reliability of MRH assessments. Additionally, cross‐site case discussions were held regularly between the research pharmacists to ensure the standardization of MRH assessments. An end‐point committee independent from data collection, consisting of three senior geriatricians and a senior researcher in clinical pharmacy, was provided with the structured case summaries of all cases of MRH by the research pharmacists. The role of the committee was to review, scrutinize and finally confirm or reject cases of MRH by consensus. Implicated medicines were classified according to the World Health Organization–Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (WHO‐ATC) classification system. Healthcare utilization and cost analysis The three sources of data collected (participant interviews, GP records, hospital readmissions) provided information on NHS use over the 8‐week follow‐up (including emergency department visits, hospital admission, outpatient clinics, GP visits and out‐of‐hours care). The date and reason for consultation were used to determine NHS utilization associated with MRH. We used the Department of Health's 2013/14 payment by results NHS tariff data to cost episodes of healthcare utilization by linking them to Healthcare Resource Groups (HRGs)  31 . When in doubt, we took the most cautious approach, such as for emergency department visits and out‐of‐hours care.
 1 With no investigations and no treatment in the emergency department, costing £58 per episode  31 . Out‐of‐hours medical visits associated with MRH were costed at £53.60 using data from the National Audit Office  32 , which reports that 50% of visits cost £53.60 to £86.30. This cautious approach avoided false assumptions about the extent of investigation and treatment. 
 To estimate the annual cost in England of postdischarge MRH in older adults, we multiplied the average excess cost related to MRH per discharged participant in our study by the estimated number of unplanned admissions of older people in 2013/14 in England  33 .Furthermore, we disaggregated the costs of MRH‐associated healthcare use by preventability. Statistical analysis We examined variable distributions for normality and compared the characteristics of the cohort included in the final analysis with those of patients lost to follow‐up, using the Mann–Whitney U‐test. Fisher's exact test was used to compare categorical variables. The incidence of MRH is reported as: (i) the incidence proportion (number of participants experiencing MRH/total sample) and (ii) the incidence of events per 1000 discharged participants (number of events × 1000/total sample). Other descriptive statistics are based on frequency calculations. Incidence proportions are presented with accompanying 95% confidence intervals. We analysed data using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 22 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results Participant characteristics The study recruited 1280 older adults at hospital discharge and followed up participants for 8 weeks. Research pharmacists completed a telephone interview with 873 participants (68.2%) and retrieved the GP records of 922 participants (72.0%). From the 1280 recruited participants, 17 (1.3%) died without follow‐up, and 147 participants (11.5%) were lost to follow‐up because they were not readmitted, their GP records were unavailable or they could not be contacted. Therefore, our final cohort included 1116 (87.2%) participants (see Table  1 ). Table 1 Baseline participant characteristics

Incidence of MRH Overall, 413 participants [37.0% (95% CI 34.2–39.9%)] experienced MRH in the 8‐week follow‐up period, with 856 medicines implicated in 621 events. This represents an MRH incidence of 556 events per 1000 participants over an 8‐week time frame. A total of 460 MRH events (74%) were attributable to medicines prescribed at hospital discharge, with the remainder prescribed in the community during the 8‐week observation period. Of the 413 participants whom we classified as having MRH, 246 (60%) experienced at least one MRH event considered ‘probable’ ( n  = 110) or ‘definite’ ( n  = 136). The remaining cases were ‘possible’ ( n  = 167). The prevalence of non‐adherence in our cohort was 29.1% at follow‐up (325 out of 1112 participants with adherence data). ADRs were solely responsible for MRH in 301 out of 413 cases (72.9%), non‐adherence in 45 cases (10.9%) and a medication error in 14 cases (3.4%). In five cases (1.2%), the patient experienced harm from both an ADR and a medication error. The underlying medication error was at the stage of prescribing in 11 cases, dispensing in four cases, administration by a carer in three cases and patient error in the use of a medicine administration device in one case. In 48 cases (11.6%), harm was due to both an ADR and non‐adherence. For example, a participant who experienced a gastric bleed associated with antiplatelet therapy was non‐adherent to their proton‐pump inhibitor. One quarter of ADRs occurred in the first week postdischarge, and 68% within 30 days of discharge. Severity and preventability of MRH Four participants (1.0%) experienced a fatal event associated with the MRH; one died following a fall and fractured neck of femur associated with lorazepam use, one from a major gastrointestinal bleed associated with use of apixaban, one from a stroke associated with non‐adherence to warfarin and one from a lower respiratory tract infection associated with prednisolone‐induced immunosuppression. Nine participants (2.2%) had a life‐threatening event, and MRH was serious in a further 323 participants (78.2%). We classified medication harm as ‘definitely’ preventable in 44 cases [(95% CI 7.8–14.0%)] and ‘possibly’ preventable in 170 MRH cases [(36.4–46.1%); see  Appendix 1 ]. Types of MRH and implicated medicines The body systems affected by MRH are shown in Table  2 . The main body systems affected by MRH were gastrointestinal (25.4%) or neurological (17.9%). The most common events were diarrhoea ( n  = 55; 8.9%), constipation ( n  = 52; 8.4%), falls ( n  = 35; 5.6%) and bleeding ( n  = 31; 5.0%).

The most common events were diarrhoea ( n  = 13; 12.4%), constipation ( n  = 11; 10.5%), dizziness ( n  = 8; 7.6%) and peripheral oedema ( n  = 8; 7.6%). Health service utilization and cost Out of the 413 MRH cases, 328 [95% CI (75.2–83.2%)] had at least one NHS service use associated with MRH, and 87 participants [95% CI (6.3–9.5%)] had an MRH‐associated hospital readmission. A total of 328 participants received 441 NHS consults [GP consultation ( n  = 316; 71.7%), hospital readmission ( n  = 96; 21.8%], outpatient clinic attendance ( n  = 12; 2.7%], emergency department attendance ( n  = 9; 2.0%), out‐of‐hours visit ( n  = 8; 1.8%)]. The cumulative NHS cost, over the 8‐week period after hospital discharge, was £225 747, an average cost per participant with MRH of £546.60. Hospital readmissions accounted for 93% of total costs. The estimated annual cost to the NHS of MRH postdischarge in older adults is £395.5 million. The cost of preventable MRH lies between £51.6 million per year (only MRH classified as ‘definitely preventable’) and £243.4 million per year (MRH ‘definitely’ or ‘possibly’ preventable). Discussion This was the first UK study to investigate medication harm in older adults following hospital discharge. Our key findings were that MRH affects one in three older adults, and that 80% of cases were serious, and at least 10% preventable. Four out of five participants with MRH consulted an NHS service within 8 weeks postdischarge. We estimated that postdischarge MRH to the older population incurs an annual cost in the region of £400 million to the NHS, and that most of this cost is attributable to hospital readmissions. ADRs are the main form of MRH, and 25% manifest in the first week postdischarge. A large proportion of older adults (29%) are non‐adherent in the postdischarge period, and the present study clearly demonstrated the harms associated with this; non‐adherence was implicated in 23% of MRH cases, including one death. While the study did not seek to identify medication errors, harm attributable to a medication error was recorded and represented a very small proportion of the overall MRH burden (&lt;5%). In the majority of these cases, the medication error was made at the prescribing stage. Strengths and limitations The main strengths of the study were the comprehensive data collection (participant interview, primary care records and readmission review) and the fact that we recruited a large, multicentre cohort of older adults (average age &gt;80 years). Our definition of MRH reflects ‘real‐life’ for patients by including harm from non‐adherence (as opposed to only ADRs), and, we employed a robust approach to ascribe MRH causality using a validated algorithm  24  and the clinical expertise of senior pharmacists and geriatricians. However, there were also several limitations. Participants' involvement in the study might have heightened their awareness of potential ADRs. They might therefore have been more attentive to medicines‐related information and usage instructions, or more likely to seek healthcare when MRH was suspected. However, this increased knowledge might also have enabled participants to attribute and report MRH more accurately. Retrospective participant interviews may have resulted in under‐reporting of MRH due to poor recall, and GPs may not have recorded all MRH encountered owing to time pressures or a perceived lack of severity  34 . Harm arising from medication errors might have been underestimated as we did not look actively for postdischarge medication reconciliation errors and assess their impact. It is possible, therefore, that some MRH was misclassified as an ADR, rather than a harm due to medication error. Nonetheless, a very small proportion of medication errors actually lead to patient harm  35 . The NHS costs we report are an approximation based on the incidence and types of MRH in the present study. We recorded NHS utilization associated with MRH, and could not infer causality. Nonetheless, hospital readmissions accounted for 93% of overall cost, and in these cases the MRH was verified as a principal driver for admission by the medical consultant in charge. Comparison with other studies The proportion of participants experiencing MRH (37%) in our study was higher than previously reported  36 . This was probably due to methodological differences as opposed to any peculiarities in our study population or the healthcare system. A retrospective analysis of 1000 older patients in the United States found that 18.7% experienced MRH over a 45‐day period following hospital discharge  21 . This study identified events through review of medical notes, contrasting with our prospective methods, which additionally included participant interviews. Retrospective studies and studies that exclude participant interviews tend to report a lower incidence of MRH  12 ,  37 . A prospective European study of 209 patients (average age 74 years) found that 30% of their cohort experienced an ADR over a 30‐day postdischarge period  38 . This finding was comparable to our results, although our slightly higher incidence of 37% probably reflected the inclusion of MRH from non‐adherence. We found that 11% of participants experiencing MRH had an event that was definitely preventable. Nevertheless, we believe that the true proportion is likely to be higher as 41% of MRH cases were possibly preventable. A systematic review published in 2011 by Taché  et al . reported that 16.5% of MRH events in the community were preventable, based on all age groups  12 . The high proportion of preventable events in our study reflected the particularly challenging period (i.e. postdischarge) we investigated in an older population, and our inclusion of harm from non‐adherence to medicines. The systematic review by Taché  et al .  12  found cardiovascular medicines to be most implicated in MRH in the community setting, reflecting the high prevalence of their use. Our study found that 22% of MRH was associated with antihypertensive medicines. However, the highest risk of MRH was associated with opiates. Concerns have been raised about the potential harm related to overuse of opiates in noncancer patients in the UK  39 , and our study demonstrated the actual harm associated with opiate use in older adults. Implications for practitioners and policy makers Given the high proportion of preventable MRH in our study, there is considerable scope for improving patient safety. The lack of prescriber knowledge of harms is a key driver of medicines overuse  40 , and, clinicians are more likely to overestimate the benefits of treatment and underestimate the harms  41 . The present study highlights the extent of MRH during a critical juncture of healthcare provision, and supports the need for increased pharmacovigilance among clinicians in secondary and primary care. While most MRH in the postdischarge period was attributable to medicines prescribed in the hospital setting, one‐quarter of implicated medicines were prescribed in the community. It is crucial to reconcile the medicines that patients receive on discharge from hospital, with those already listed on the repeat prescription from the GP, and any additional medicines which the patient takes at home. Prescribers in the community must be wary of the heightened vulnerability of patients to harm in the immediate postdischarge period, as physiological systems remain impaired during recovery from acute illness and the stressors associated with hospitalization (e.g. poor nourishment, deconditioning, sleep disturbance, delirium)  17 . There are numerous lists of potentially inappropriate medicines for older adults  42  [e.g. Screening Tool of Older Persons' Potentially inappropriate Prescriptions (STOPP), Beers, (European Union Potentially Inappropriate Medications (EU‐PIM)]. While these have merit, a ‘hard and fast’ rules‐based approach does not account for the biopsychosocial complexity of patients  43 ,  44 . Simple guiding principles that support clinical judgement for the safe initiation of medicine [e.g. the BEGIN (1. Basis for therapy; 2. Evaluate risk of interactions; 3. Given agreement; 4. Intended benefit likely; 5. No better alternative) algorithm  45  or the Medication Appropriateness Index  46 ] may be more practical and effective  47 . When prescribers initiate new medicines, a tentative stop or review date should always be specified. While it remains unclear from randomized trials if medication review on its own reduces MRH in older adults, multicomponent interventions incorporating patient education have demonstrated success during transitions of care  13 ,  48 . In addition, there are several risk prediction tools to identify patients at high risk for MRH, although these have been largely developed for a hospitalized population  49 . In the present study, we showed that the risk of MRH is highest in the community setting following hospital discharge. Future work should focus on developing a tool to identify high‐risk patients during this particularly vulnerable period. Our national cost estimate of almost £400 million per year is a conservative estimate. It excludes the indirect costs from wasted medicines (non‐adherence and poor therapeutic value, or medicines that must be stopped owing to adverse effects) and the social costs of additional formal and informal care (e.g. time taken away from work by relatives to support participants). The bulk of the cost arises from hospital readmissions. Therefore, early recognition of medication‐related problems and community management as far as possible could generate large savings. In conclusion, medication harm in older adults is a common and costly phenomenon following hospital discharge. Increased vigilance to high‐risk prescribing, and supporting the appropriate use of medicines in the community, might reduce this problem. Competing Interests There are no competing interests to declare.

    <Body>What is already known about this subject 
 Medical schools have been moving away from dedicated clinical pharmacology (CP) teaching, contributing to students feeling that their CP knowledge and prescribing skills are lacking Physician trainees and newly licensed physicians are more susceptible to making mistakes when prescribing e‐Learning resources may be on par with traditional classroom learning. 
 What this study adds 
 A comprehensive, framework‐based methodology to evaluate e‐Learning resources A comprehensive search for open access international CP e‐Learning resources revealed only 8 eligible English‐language resources The National Prescribing Curriculum of Australia scored the highest based on comprehensiveness, quality, usability and content suitability for medical students. 
 1 INTRODUCTION In every type of clinical practice, physicians must know how to prescribe safely, effectively, and within regulatory parameters; however, suboptimal prescribing remains 1 of the most serious issues that healthcare providers and patients face. 1 ,  2 ,  3  A systematic review of the prevalence, incidence and nature of prescribing errors in adult and paediatric inpatients across 63 studies, found that medication errors, of varying clinical importance, occurred at a median rate of 52 (interquartile range 8–227) per 100 admitted patients or in 7% (interquartile range 2–14%) of all medication orders. 4  Similarly, the UK EQUIP (Enhancing the Quality of User Involved Care Planning) study reviewed over 124 260 prescriptions from 19 hospitals and found 11 077 errors with a mean error rate of 8.9%. 5 
 The EQUIP study further noted that physician trainees may be particularly susceptible to making errors as 4190 (38%) of the 11 077 were committed by first‐year residents (new graduates in their first year of speciality training). 5  They documented that residents have insufficient support to make competent decisions about drugs that they are not familiar with, and do not adequately have the information to address all of the issues with common drugs. A survey of 2413 UK medical students and recent graduates found that 74% felt that they were inadequately trained in clinical pharmacology (CP), citing a lack of learning opportunities. 6  A similar theme arose in a survey conducted with final year McMaster University medical students ( n  = 143) where 73.3% of the survey participants felt that CP was not sufficiently covered in their medical education even though 73.1% of them agreed that it was a priority topic. 7 
 In Canada, CP and toxicology (CPT) is the specialty of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada that focuses on optimal drug therapy and appropriate prescribing. 8  Many Canadian medical schools lack a dedicated CPT or rational therapeutics course, instead attempt to integrate it with other subjects. 9  A report by Maxwell and Webb in 2006 also documented the disappearance of dedicated courses and assessments related to CPT in the UK, which in turn decreased the available time devoted to improving prescribing competence. 10  The European Association of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics has also reported a need to restructure their current CP education to deal with deficiencies in CP knowledge and practical prescribing skills. 11 
 In the UK, the mandatory Prescribing Safety Assessment was developed by the Medical Schools Council and British Pharmacological Society to ensure that graduating medical students met a threshold of CP knowledge and prescribing skills. However, British students had previously noted that there were insufficient opportunities to learn about medications during medical school potentially making it difficult to meet the expectations of the Prescribing Safety Assessment. 6 ,  12 
 In collaboration with British Pharmacological Society, our group developed an Ontario Prescribing Competency Assessment for Medical Trainees, with the aim of highlighting the importance of learning this discipline and improving prescribing quality. 13 ,  14  This pilot demonstrated that there are major gaps in prescribing competency that require more concentrated training in medical school to address. In addition, a survey of leadership from all 17 Canadian medical schools ( n  = 372) found that faculty country‐wide believe that there is a need to improve the threshold of prescribing competency and would welcome a standardized assessment to improve CPT learning. 15 
 Although medical schools still predominantly educate through traditional means (e.g. lectures, tutorials, bedside learning), they have also adopted e‐Learning in the form of blended learning to enhance education. 16 ,  17  This report defines e‐Learning resources as structured online websites or modules created for learning purposes. The proposed benefits of online educational resources include improved standardization of curricula, ability to select and extend the reach of excellent teachers, flexibility of delivery, pace, interactivity, and inclusion of formative assessment to suit individual learner preferences. 2 
 A meta‐analysis conducted in 2008 studied e‐Learning interventions for students or practitioners in the health professions (e.g. physicians, veterinarians, nurses) in a wide variety of countries. Based on 63 studies including 24 randomized trials, e‐Learning interventions compared with non‐Internet‐based interventions had a small effect on knowledge gain (0.12, 95% CI, 0.003–0.24;  P  = .045). These findings suggest that the effectiveness of e‐Learning may be on par with traditional methods of teaching. 18  A subsequent systematic review of 51 studies including 30 RCTs, found that interactivity, practice exercise, repetition, and feedback were the features associated with improvements in knowledge, skills, and behaviours. 19  These findings plus those advocated in the Medical Education Framework 20  emphasize ease‐of‐use, clarity of communication, intuitive and appealing design, interactive features, ability to engage in discussion, practice exercises, and repetition in the creation of e‐Learning Resources. 18 ,  19 ,  20 ,  21 ,  22 ,  23 
 The objectives in this study were: (i) to compile an inventory of online English language curriculum resources for teaching CP to medical students; and (ii) to evaluate their comprehensiveness, usability, quality and content suitability for medical students. 2 METHODS We performed primary literature reviews of ERIC, Medline and EMBASE to identify international e‐Learning resources related to CP which would be available to medical students. Search terms included (Clinical pharmacology OR prescribing OR pharmaceutical education OR prescription competency) AND (e‐Learning OR distance education OR learning modules OR distance learning OR interactive learning OR computer‐assisted instruction OR computer assisted instruction OR computer‐based instruction OR computer based instruction OR web‐based training OR web based training) AND (medical student OR medical education OR medical school). We restricted our search to the previous 10 years as of December 2017. Our protocol was approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board (ID: #4167). A short, self‐administered online survey was developed for medical school faculty using the survey tool LimeSurvey (Version 2.71.1) and according to published guidelines. 24 ,  25  The survey asked respondents if they knew of any online curriculum resources related to CP. It was pre‐tested internally for clarity and completeness. A CP faculty contact list was created using lists provided by national professional societies related to CP education in predominantly English‐speaking countries (Canada, UK, USA, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa). We also searched for relevant faculty using individual medical school faculty lists. If no CP department was identified, the school dean or department chair was included with the expectation that they would recommend relevant individuals. The survey was launched in February 2017 with 3 reminders sent over the span of a month. Resources identified by either our literature search or by the faculty survey were screened by the investigators to determine if it available online in English and open to everyone with no need for payment or institutional account. Duplicate, irrelevant resources, traditional textbooks and online textbooks were also excluded from further analysis. Remaining resources were then evaluated for comprehensiveness. This was based on coverage of the 15 therapeutic groups (e.g. cardiovascular, psychiatry, endocrine) found in the McMaster Essential Drug List for Medical Students ( Appendix S1 ). If none of the recommended drug families within a group were addressed, the group score was zero, 1–4 drug families addressed yielded a score of 1, and more than 5 families addressed, received a score of 2. The maximum possible score for comprehensiveness was 30. Resources were then evaluated by medical student volunteers ( n  = 7) for usability and quality and by CP faculty ( n  = 3) for content suitability using 5‐point Likert scales (0–4). Usability evaluated the overall organization of the resource, if it had an intuitive layout, if navigation through the modules was easy or difficult, the user interface, the clarity in which the resource presents itself, and if it adequately communicated with the user. Quality evaluated levels of user interaction, ability to collaborate, level of feedback, use of clinical case, if key concepts were highlighted, and the level of engagement with quizzes and assessments. Faculty rated suitability based on whether the resource was targeted to an appropriate level of difficulty for final year medical students nearing graduation (a common threshold for evaluation of all levels of medical school experience), and whether it could be incorporated into the curriculum. Inter‐rater agreement was measured with intra‐class correlations (ICC) and the final ratings were obtained by consensus. 26  ICC was calculated using IBM SPSS Statistics (Ver. 25.0), 2‐way random consistent ICC analysis for medical student raters and 2‐way mixed consistency ICC analysis for faculty. Total scores for each online resource were calculated by summing percentage scores for each of the 4 sections (comprehensiveness, usability, quality and content suitability), each weighted equally. 3 RESULTS A total of 236 schools in Canada, USA, UK, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand were identified, 17 of which were omitted due to lack of available online directories. 619 invitations to faculty were sent, with 252 responses (40.7%) received. A total of 81 resources were identified, 59 from the faculty survey, 22 from the literature review. Of the 81 resources, 73 were excluded for various reasons (details in Figure  1 . Flow Chart) leaving 8 potential CP e‐Learning resources available for evaluation (Table  1 ). A report of all excluded resources with rationale can be found at Appendix  S2 .

 Summarized scores of the reviewed resources in this study arranged from highest to lowest average score. BRATS, Drugs Resource at Barts &amp; the London School of Medicine; FAST, Life in the Fastlane; IUPHAR, Pharmacology Education Project; ME, Medical Education; NPC, National Prescribing Curriculum; RCPSC, Navigating Medical Emergencies; TOX, WikiTox; TRC Teaching Resource Center. The National Prescribing Curriculum (NPC) developed in Australia was the highest rated resource, with a total score of 77. The NPC was developed to help undergraduate and postgraduate medical trainees in developing prescribing competency. The modules focused on the clinical aspect of prescribing, requiring users to interact by answering questions, going through the steps of prescribing, as well as developing a personal formulary and completing an end‐module summary quiz. Usability, quality and content suitability scores were high, noting the augmented interactivity, practice material and generally applicable cross‐national prescribing norms as a major benefit. The Teaching Resource Center produced in the Netherlands for medical students was the second highest rated resource with a score of 65. This resource scored highly for its comprehensive drug coverage and above average for usability and quality. However, it was complicated to navigate, had minimal opportunities for self‐testing, and provided limited feedback. The Drugs Resource at Barts &amp; The London School of Medicine, developed in the UK for medical students, ranked third overall with a score of 58. Even though it ranked highly for both usability and interactivity, its limited scope resulted in a low comprehensiveness score. However, faculty rated the content as suitable for medical students. Similar to Teaching Resource Center, the Pharmacology Education Project included content covering the majority of the therapeutic groups, and multiple drug classes within each therapeutic groups. However, Pharmacology Education Project along with WikiTox and Life in the Fastlane rated low for quality because they lacked interaction, practice material and provided minimal feedback. Life in the Fastlane also had the lowest score in usability due to lack of a strong organizational structure. Medical Education and Navigating Medical Emergencies both had issues with a lack of comprehensiveness and quality suitability resulting in the 2 lowest scores (37 and 41 respectively). Inter‐rater reliability was generally good with ICC values for medical students &gt;0.7, except for the Medical Education resource (ICC = 0.506) and &gt;0.8 for all faculty ratings between all the resources. 4 DISCUSSION This project is the first to create an evaluation metric, based on e‐Learning effectiveness and guidance literature, and use it to evaluate readily available English‐language e‐Learning resources for medical student education in CP. Given the pressures on medical school teaching time and budgets, it is important to identify existing high quality, relevant online curriculum resources as a means to supplement essential curriculum. 19  The NPC was found to be the most valuable for medical students due to its combination of accessibility, comprehensiveness ,  usability, e‐Learning quality principles and content suitability. The limited number of available resources, with only 1 originating in North America, is disappointing but aligns with previous studies suggesting a reduced focus on clinical pharmacology in medical schools. 10 
 Our study has several limitations, including a focus only on English‐language resources, and exclusion of resources requiring payment. Additionally, all raters were Canadian which may skew our comprehensiveness and suitability results towards a Canadian perspective; however, the themes identified in usability and quality should be universally applicable. Most importantly, this study did not seek to determine if the resources  actually  improved user knowledge or prescribing competence. This is an important future study. Adoption of international CP e‐Learning resources may have challenges, given the varying drug names, prescribing norms and drug regulatory structures across countries. However, these are remediable issues. As e‐Learning and the technology behind it continues to improve in quality and reliability to better engage learners, the prevalence of e‐Learning's role in the classroom will be very likely to continue to grow in the future. Next steps in research include evaluating the effectiveness of the e‐Learning resources for medical student knowledge and prescribing skills, and to use similar evaluation methods to rate some of the less accessible resources. 5 CONCLUSIONS There is a dearth of high quality, free, readily available, English‐language e‐Learning resources focused on improving CP knowledge and prescribing competence. Given the lack of resources and funding to develop objective, evidence‐based material, medical schools may wish to adapt the highly rated resources reviewed in this study. Supporting information

    <Body>What is Already Known about this Subject 
 Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are all metabolized by the liver. Pathophysiological changes occurring in cirrhosis affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs. The safety of PPIs in cirrhosis has been questioned lately. 
 What this Study Adds 
 Exposure to lansoprazole and pantoprazole in patients with cirrhosis was considerably increased while esomeprazole pharmacokinetics seemed largely spared. When used orally, a PPI without large pharmacokinetic changes is recommended in the vulnerable cirrhotic patient. Future studies examining the safety of PPIs should also pay attention to differences between PPIs. 
 Introduction 
 http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/FamilyDisplayForward?familyId=160  inhibitors (PPIs) are among the most frequently used medications worldwide  1 . They are effective drugs in suppressing acid secretion and have a wide margin of safety. In recent years, safety issues have been raised which led the FDA to issue several warnings  2 . Long‐term PPI use has been associated with increased risk of respiratory infections, bone fractures and hypomagnesaemia, especially in older people with comorbidities such as renal or liver disease  3 ,  4 ,  5 . In addition, use of PPIs in patients with cirrhosis has been linked to the development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatic encephalopathy (HE)  6 ,  7 ,  8 . Intestinal bacterial overgrowth and translocation are mentioned as possible causes  9 ,  10 . These risks are particularly relevant as patients with cirrhosis frequently use PPIs. Two recent studies suggest that more than half of cirrhotics received a PPI, often without a clear indication  6 ,  11 . All PPIs are metabolized by the liver. The pathophysiological changes that accompany cirrhosis affect pharmacokinetics. Portal vein shunting leads to a higher systemic availability of drugs, while synthetic insufficiency results in low levels of plasma proteins and a higher unbound fraction  12 ,  13 . Even so, the activity of drug‐metabolizing enzymes is decreased and biliary excretion can be reduced  12 ,  13 . These changes often result in higher plasma concentrations and increased exposure to drugs in patients with cirrhosis. For PPIs, a rise in exposure can lead to enhanced acid suppression  14 ,  15 . This raises questions whether pharmacokinetic alterations due to cirrhosis influence the safety profile of PPIs and whether dose adjustments are needed. Currently, there is a paucity of practice guidance for the safe use and dosing of PPIs in cirrhosis. In a previous study, a method was developed to use pharmacokinetic and safety data for evaluating drug safety in cirrhosis  16 . In the current study, we use this method to develop safety and dosing practical guidance for the use of PPIs in patients with cirrhosis. Methods We used a combination of information from registration authorities, literature and expert opinion to develop practical guidance  16 . A specific method was needed to translate the available literature and experience into an easy manageable source of information on safe prescribing aimed at the needs of clinical decision making. A detailed version of this method has been published before  16 . All PPIs currently registered in the Netherlands were considered for evaluation. These were:  http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=5488 ,  http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=7208 ,  http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=4279 ,  http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=7260  and  http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=7290 . We focused on developing guidance for the oral use of PPIs; the intravenous use in gastrointestinal bleeding is considered life‐saving and only used for a short period of time. The safety evaluation process consisted of several steps. Steps 1–3 were performed by a pharmacist with experience in evaluating drug safety in cirrhosis (R.W.). Critical steps were checked by a second pharmacist/epidemiologist (S.B.). Step 1: Collection of evidence Data collection focused on gathering all available evidence needed to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of PPIs in cirrhotic patients. This included data from registration authorities (product information) and published literature. Electronic databases PubMed and Embase were searched and Web of Science was used for citation tracking. The search strategy can be found in Table  1 . Articles were included if (one of) the outcome(s) was safety and/or pharmacokinetics of a PPI in patients with cirrhosis. Table 1 Search strategy used for electronic database search

If no European product information was available, the Dutch product information was used. From the included literature, the study design, number and characteristics of patients and controls (e.g. severity of cirrhosis) and details on the intervention were retrieved. The following data were extracted on the outcome(s):
 Pharmacokinetics: pharmacokinetic parameters of the PPI [e.g. maximum plasma concentration ( C 
 max ) and area under the curve (AUC)]. Safety: the number of adverse events (AEs) observed during PPI use and data on discontinuation due to these events. 
 Results were reported in summary tables for each outcome and sorted by level of evidence. The evidence level of each study was assessed using the treatment harms criteria from the Oxford Centre for Evidence‐Base Medicine  17 . Step 3: Classification and dose suggestion Based on the collected data, an initial safety classification and dose was suggested for each PPI, if applicable sorted by severity of cirrhosis. The severity was expressed using the Child–Turcotte–Pugh (CTP) classification  18 . The safety classification could be: safe, no additional risks known, additional risks known, unsafe, or unknown. Table  2  provides an overview of the safety classification and the actions advised for health care professionals. Pharmacokinetic data were used to judge whether a dose adjustment was necessary. Table 2 Safety classification of drugs used in cirrhosis Description Action 
 Safe 
 The drug has been evaluated in patients with cirrhosis, and no increase in harm was found. The safety of the drug is supported by pharmacokinetic studies and/or safety studies over a long period. It might be necessary to use an adjusted dose. This drug can be used by patients with cirrhosis. 
 No additional risks known 
 Limited data suggest that this drug does not increase harm in patients with cirrhosis in comparison with persons without cirrhosis. It might be necessary to use an adjusted dose. The drug can be used in patients with cirrhosis. Adverse events need to be monitored. 
 Additional risks known 
 Limited data suggest an increase in patient harm in patients with cirrhosis compared to persons without cirrhosis. However, the number of studies is limited and/or the studies show contradicting results about the safety in patients with cirrhosis. This drug should preferably not be used in patients with cirrhosis if there is a safer alternative available. Adverse events need to be monitored. 
 Unsafe 
 Data indicate this drug is not safe in patients with cirrhosis. This drug should be avoided in patients with cirrhosis. 
 Unknown 
 For this drug, insufficient data are available to evaluate the safety in patients with cirrhosis. This drug should preferably not be used in patients with cirrhosis if there is a safer alternative available.

 Step 4: Discussion and conclusion by an expert panel An expert panel was composed consisting of ten members with specific expertise in the treatment of patients with cirrhosis, in clinical pharmacology and/or in evidence‐based medicine. These included gastroenterologists, a general practitioner and hospital and community pharmacists. The expert panel evaluated data extraction and presentation (Steps 1 and 2) and endorsed conclusions derived from the evidence (Step 3). Likewise, the validity and clinical relevance of the proposed safety classification and suggested dose were discussed by the expert panel during a meeting. The final advice was based on evidence and clinical experience of the expert panel and concluded by consensus. All conflicts of interest of the members of the expert panel were identified, disclosed and published  16 . The chair of the expert panel (S.B.) declared no conflicts of interest. Step 5: Implementation Practical guidance was incorporated in the two national drug databases in the Netherlands (Pharmabase and G‐standard) and on a free website. Health care professionals will get specific alerts when prescribing PPIs in cirrhosis and are referred to the website for more information. Step 6: Continuity To keep the advice up‐to‐date, literature searches will be checked yearly and relevant studies will be discussed with the expert panel. Once every five years, a complete update is planned.

Results The developed practical guidance is based on information from the product information (Table  3 )  21 ,  22 ,  23 ,  24 ,  25 ,  26 ,  27 ,  28 ,  29 ,  30  and data extracted from 69 articles included in the literature review (Figure  1 )  6 ,  7 ,  8 ,  11 ,  31 ,  32 ,  33 ,  34 ,  35 ,  36 ,  37 ,  38 ,  39 ,  40 ,  41 ,  42 ,  43 ,  44 ,  45 ,  46 ,  47 ,  48 ,  49 ,  50 ,  51 ,  52 ,  53 ,  54 ,  55 ,  56 ,  57 ,  58 ,  59 ,  60 ,  61 ,  62 ,  63 ,  64 ,  65 ,  66 ,  67 ,  68 ,  69 ,  70 ,  71 ,  72 ,  73 ,  74 ,  75 ,  76 ,  77 ,  78 ,  79 ,  80 ,  81 ,  82 ,  83 ,  84 ,  85 ,  86 ,  87 ,  88 ,  89 ,  90 ,  91 ,  92 ,  93 ,  94 ,  95 . Twelve of the included studies focused on pharmacokinetics (Table  4 ), 51 on safety, and six studied both safety and pharmacokinetics of PPIs. Of the safety studies, 20 specifically investigated the safety of an individual PPI (Table  5 ), while 37 studied safety issues of PPIs as a group (Table  S1 ).

 Esomeprazole  [ 
 21 
 ,  
 22 
 ] In patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the metabolism of esomeprazole could be decreased. In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the metabolism of esomeprazole is decreased leading to a doubling of the AUC. Therefore, do not exceed the maximum dose of 20 mg in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Esomeprazole and main metabolites do not tend to accumulate with once daily dosing. The steady state pharmacokinetics of esomeprazole obtained after administration of 40 mg once daily to four patients each with mild (Child–Pugh A), moderate (Child–Pugh Class B), and severe (Child–Pugh Class C) liver insufficiency were compared to those obtained in 36 male and female Gastro‐oesophageal Reflux Disease patients with normal liver function. In patients with mild and moderate hepatic insufficiency, the AUCs were within the range that could be expected in patients with normal liver function. In patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, the AUCs were 2–3 times higher than in the patients with normal liver function. No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency (Child–Pugh Classes A and B). However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency (Child–Pugh Class C), a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded. 
 Lansoprazole  [ 
 23 
 ,  
 24 
 ] The exposure to lansoprazole is doubled in patients with mild hepatic impairment and much more increased in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. Patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment should be kept under regular supervision and a 50% reduction of the daily dose is recommended. In patients with various degrees of chronic hepatic impairment, the mean plasma half‐life of lansoprazole was prolonged from 1.5 h to 3.2–7.2 h. An increase in the mean AUC of up to 500% was observed at steady state in hepatically‐impaired patients compared to healthy subjects. Consider dose reduction in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
 Omeprazole  [ 
 25 
 ,  
 26 
 ] In patients with hepatic impairment, the metabolism of omeprazole is decreased causing a higher AUC. The once daily dosing of omeprazole has no tendency to accumulate. For patients with hepatic impairment, a daily dose of 10–20 mg may be sufficient. In patients with chronic hepatic disease, the bioavailability increased to approximately 100% compared with an IV dose, reflecting decreased first‐pass effect, and the plasma half‐life of the drug increased to nearly 3 h compared with the half‐life in normal subjects of 0.5–1 h. Plasma clearance averaged 70 ml min −1 , compared with a value of 500–600 ml min −1  in normal subjects. Dose reduction, particularly where maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis is indicated, for the hepatically impaired should be considered. 
 Pantoprazole  [ 
 27 
 ,  
 28 
 ] Although for patients with liver cirrhosis (Child–Pugh A and B) the half‐life ​​increased to 7–9 h, and the AUC ​increased by a factor 5–7, the maximum serum concentration only increased by a factor of 1.5 compared to healthy individuals. In patients with severe hepatic impairment, a daily dose of 20 mg of pantoprazole may not be exceeded. Pantoprazole 40 mg should not be used in combination therapy for the eradication of  H. pylori  in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, since no data are available on the efficacy and safety. Liver enzymes in patients with severe hepatic impairment should be monitored regularly. If there is an increase in liver enzyme values, the treatment should be stopped In patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment (Child–Pugh A–C cirrhosis), maximum pantoprazole concentrations increased only slightly (1.5‐fold) relative to healthy subjects. Although serum half‐life values increased to 7–9 h and AUC values increased by five‐ to sevenfold in hepatic‐impaired patients, these increases were no greater than those observed in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, where no dosage adjustment is warranted. These pharmacokinetic changes in hepatic‐impaired patients result in minimal drug accumulation following once‐daily, multiple‐dose administration. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment. Doses higher than 40 mg day −1  have not been studied in hepatically impaired patients. 
 Rabeprazole  [ 
 29 
 ,  
 30 
 ] In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, the AUC doubled compared to healthy volunteers after administration of a single dose of 20 mg rabeprazole, and there was a two‐ to three‐fold increase in the half‐life of rabeprazole. After a daily dose of 20 mg for 7 days, however, the AUC was increased only by a factor of 1.5 and the  C 
 max  only by a factor of 1.2. In patients with hepatic impairment, the half‐life of rabeprazole was 12.3 h compared to 2.1 h in healthy volunteers. The pharmacodynamic response in the two groups (determination of pH in the stomach) was clinically comparable. For patients with hepatic impairment, no dose adjustments are required. In a single‐dose study of 10 patients with chronic mild to moderate compensated cirrhosis of the liver who were administered a 20 mg dose of rabeprazole, AUC was approximately doubled, the elimination half‐life was two‐ to threefold higher, and total body clearance was decreased to less than half compared to values in healthy men. In a multiple‐dose study of 12 patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment administered 20 mg rabeprazole once daily for eight days, AUC and  C 
 max  values increased approximately 20% compared to values in healthy age‐ and gender‐matched subjects. These increases were not statistically significant. No information exists on rabeprazole disposition in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Administration of rabeprazole to patients with mild to moderate liver impairment resulted in increased exposure and decreased elimination. Due to the lack of clinical data on rabeprazole in patients with severe hepatic impairment, caution should be exercised in those patients. AUC, area under the curve;  C

Esomeprazole In a multiple‐dose pharmacokinetic study (level 4) exposure to esomeprazole in eight cirrhotic patients with CTP A and B was comparable with healthy controls, while it more than doubled in four CTP C patients (Table  4 )  31 . This study was also mentioned in the product information, where a maximum dosage of 20 mg is advised in CTP C patients (Table  3 )  21 ,  22 . Regarding safety, in one case report esomeprazole was tolerated well (Table  5 )  53 . In the pharmacokinetic study, 25% of 12 patients suffered an adverse event (i.e. constipation, diarrhoea and HE) when using 40 mg per day for five days. The patient with HE had severe cirrhosis. Expert judgement Based on these limited data, esomeprazole was classified as ‘no additional risks known’. In CTP C patients, the evidence is very thin (one study in four subjects). Because of a doubling in exposure in CTP C patients, the recommendations of the product information are adopted to use no more than 20 mg per day in CTP C patients. Omeprazole In ten studies (level 3 and 4) with a total of 140 patients, the pharmacokinetics of omeprazole were explored (Table  4 )  33 ,  34 ,  35 ,  36 ,  37 ,  47 ,  57 ,  58 ,  59 ,  60 . Two articles showed higher exposure with increasing severity of cirrhosis, and a modelling study predicted the same  33 ,  34 ,  36 . In CTP A, the AUC was slightly higher in comparison with healthy controls, in CTP B it was doubled, and exposure was more than doubled in CTP C patients. Two other single‐dose studies found a higher increase in exposure (seven‐ to eightfold), but the severity of cirrhosis was not described  35 ,  37 . In healthy persons, omeprazole has an elimination half‐life of less than 1 h, prolonging in patients with cirrhosis to 2–4 h  47 ,  57 ,  60 . Elimination half‐life seems to increase with severity of cirrhosis  34 . The safety of omeprazole has been described in ten articles (level 2, 3 and 4) with 220 cirrhotic subjects (Table  5 )  34 ,  36 ,  41 ,  44 ,  46 ,  47 ,  48 ,  49 ,  51 ,  55 . In eight of these studies only mild AEs occurred with omeprazole treatment, even when treatment lasted for more than four weeks. More severe adverse events (epigastric pain, arthralgia and worsening of HE) were seen in a study where patients received a continuous infusion for two days  36 . Furthermore, in a case report, a patient with decompensated cirrhosis developed neurological adverse events (tremor, disbalance and confusion) while being on omeprazole treatment  55 . Expert judgement In the clinical studies where patients were sorted by CTP class, exposure increased with severity of cirrhosis to an almost threefold higher exposure in CTP C compared to healthy controls. Two studies measured a seven‐ and eightfold increase in exposure in cirrhotics with unknown severity. In the literature about safety, omeprazole was mostly well tolerated. However, neurological AEs were reported in patients who received a high intravenous dose and in a patient with severe cirrhosis. In CTP A and B patients, omeprazole is classified as ‘no additional risks known’ if a maximum dose of 20 mg per day is used. In CTP C, omeprazole is classified as ‘unsafe’ based on the significant pharmacokinetic alterations and it is advised to avoid its usage. Lansoprazole Pharmacokinetics of lansoprazole were explored in four articles (level 3 and 4) with a total of 38 cirrhotic patients  32 ,  33 ,  60 ,  61 . In a single‐dose study, the AUC was more than fourfold higher in compensated and in decompensated cirrhotics compared to healthy controls (Table  4 )  32 . A modelling study also predicted increased exposure, especially in CTP C patients  33 . The FDA label  24  described an increment in the AUC of up to 500% in patients with various degrees of hepatic impairment, while the Dutch product information  23  mentioned a doubling in AUC in mild hepatic impairment and a higher increase in moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Table  3 ). The FDA label and three studies describe a prolongation of the half‐life from 1.5 h in healthy subjects to 6–7 h in cirrhotics  24 ,  32 ,  60 ,  61 . In three case reports and one other study (level 3 and 4) the safety of lansoprazole was explored in a total of 33 cirrhotic patients (Table  5 )  50 ,  53 ,  54 ,  55 . In the case reports severe AEs happened that were probably caused by lansoprazole (i.e. DRESS syndrome, anaphylactic reaction and neurological adverse events)  53 ,  54 ,  55 . In the fourth study, only mild AEs occurred during two weeks of treatment  50 . Expert judgement For all CTP classes lansoprazole is classified as ‘unsafe’, based on the marked increase in exposure compared to healthy controls and the availability of PPIs without these pharmacokinetic changes. It is recommended to avoid the use of lansoprazole in patients with cirrhosis. Pantoprazole We identified six pharmacokinetic studies (level 3 and 4) with pantoprazole in 77 cirrhotic patients (Table  4 )  33 ,  38 ,  39 ,  56 ,  60 ,  62 . In two multiple‐dose studies, the AUC was five‐ to sevenfold higher in patients with cirrhosis compared to healthy controls after oral and intravenous dosing. The same increase is described in the product information of pantoprazole (Table  3 )  27 ,  28 . Another article found a similar exposure to pantoprazole for patients with CTP B and CTP C cirrhosis and controls who were slow CYP2C19 metabolizers  56 . When comparing these data with healthy controls, the AUC was five times higher in the cirrhotic patients. A modelling study predicted the same increases in exposure  33 . In healthy persons, pantoprazole has an elimination half‐life of approximately 1 h. Five studies found an elimination half‐life of 7–9 h in patients with cirrhosis  38 ,  39 ,  56 ,  60 ,  62 . Three articles (level 2, 3 and 4) studied the safety of pantoprazole in 101 patients with cirrhosis (Table  5 )  41 ,  43 ,  56 . Pantoprazole was mostly well tolerated. In one study, a CTP C patient developed HE and in a randomized trial two patients suffered from fever possibly related to PPI use  41 ,  56 . Expert judgement For all CTP classes, pantoprazole is classified as ‘unsafe’, based on the marked increase in exposure and prolonged half‐life, which cannot be corrected by dose reduction. Since there are alternatives without these large increases in exposure, we would recommend avoiding the use of pantoprazole in cirrhotic patients. Rabeprazole Two pharmacokinetic studies (level 3 and 4) were retrieved including 10 cirrhotic patients (Table  4 )  33 ,  40 . Exposure to rabeprazole more than doubled in patients with compensated cirrhosis compared to healthy controls  40 . In a modelling study this was also predicted for CTP A cirrhosis, while exposure increased more than threefold in CTP B and fivefold in CTP C cirrhosis  33 . In an article described in the product information (Table  3 ), there was no accumulation of rabeprazole after multiple doses in patients with CTP A and B  29 ,  30 . The intragastric pH was comparable between cirrhotics and healthy controls. Rabeprazole has an elimination half‐life of 1 h, prolonging to almost 4 h in cirrhotics after a single dose and to 12 h after multiple dosing  40 . Three articles (level 2 and 3) studied the safety of rabeprazole in 101 cirrhotics (Table  5 )  40 ,  42 ,  45 . In two, rabeprazole was well tolerated with only mild adverse events  40 ,  42 . In a post‐marketing surveillance study, nine of 70 patients with cirrhosis (13%) suffered an AE  45 . These were severe in two (one HE and one serious elevation in bilirubin), both recovered after discontinuation. Expert judgement For CTP A and B patients, rabeprazole is classified as ‘no additional risks known’ and a starting dose of 10 mg is recommended, based on the doubled exposure. In CTP B patients, maintaining the 10 mg dose level is advised. As there are no clinical data from CTP C patients and a modelling study predicted an increase in AUC of more than fivefold, it is, again, advised to use a PPI without these large changes and rabeprazole is classified as ‘unsafe’ in CTP C patients. Safety of PPIs as group Thirty‐seven articles studied the safety of PPIs as a group in patients with cirrhosis (Table  S1 )  6 ,  7 ,  8 ,  11 ,  63 ,  64 ,  65 ,  66 ,  67 ,  68 ,  69 ,  70 ,  71 ,  72 ,  73 ,  74 ,  75 ,  76 ,  77 ,  78 ,  79 ,  80 ,  81 ,  82 ,  83 ,  84 ,  85 ,  86 ,  87 ,  88 ,  89 ,  90 ,  91 ,  92 ,  93 ,  94 ,  95 . These studies mostly focused on the risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or infections in general. A few recent ones also examined the risk of HE. Risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis Twenty‐four observational studies (level 3 and 4)  6 ,  69 ,  70 ,  71 ,  72 ,  73 ,  75 ,  76 ,  78 ,  79 ,  81 ,  82 ,  83 ,  84 ,  85 ,  86 ,  87 ,  88 ,  89 ,  90 ,  92 ,  93 ,  94 ,  95  and seven systematic reviews (level 2)  7 ,  63 ,  64 ,  65 ,  66 ,  67 ,  68  explored the risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis with PPI use in cirrhotics. All meta‐analyses detected a significant association between PPI use and the development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis  7 ,  63 ,  64 ,  65 ,  66 ,  67 . These meta‐analyses included at least four studies  67  and at most 17  65 . Heterogeneity was high in some meta‐analyses, the meta‐analysis of Trikudanathan  et al .  67  had the lowest heterogeneity (22%) and found an odds ratio of 2.77 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.82–4.23]. In the meta‐analysis of Yu and colleagues, a sub‐analysis of only the cohort studies retrieved an odds ratio of 1.18 (95% CI 0.99–1.41) without heterogeneity (0%)  64 . No meta‐analysis incorporated dose or duration of PPI therapy in their risk calculation. Of the observational studies, four specifically investigated the duration of therapy. In three, a longer duration of PPI use was linked to a higher risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis  71 ,  82 ,  90 , while in the other, no such relation was found  72 . Four additional studies specified the dose used by cirrhotics  78 ,  84 ,  92 ,  93 . One found a higher risk with twice daily dosing versus once daily dosing  93 , while two others did not  84 ,  92 . The fourth study compared the risk between a half PPI dose and a full dose and did not find a difference  78 . Risk of infections In 11 observational studies (level 3 and 4) and two systematic reviews (level 2) the risk of bacterial infection with PPI use in cirrhotics was determined  11 ,  65 ,  68 ,  72 ,  73 ,  74 ,  75 ,  77 ,  79 ,  80 ,  81 ,  87 ,  91 . In the meta‐analysis of Xu  et al .  65 , the odds ratio for bacterial infection was 1.98 (95% CI 1.36–2.87, heterogeneity 0%). Two studies also calculated the dose‐dependent risk of infections  81 ,  87 . One of these did not find differences in dose between patients who developed an infection and patients who did not  81 . The other noted more AEs with an inadequate dosed PPI (too high or contra‐indicated)  87 . Risk of HE Six observational studies (level 3, 4) looked at the risk of HE with the use of PPIs  6 ,  8 ,  69 ,  70 ,  71 ,  72 . Four found an increased risk of HE with PPI use in cirrhotics  6 ,  8 ,  69 ,  70 , while two did not  71 ,  72 . The case–control study of Tsai and colleagues  8  provided sub‐analyses per PPI and per dose and duration of treatment. They found a positive relationship between HE risk and cumulative defined daily doses. The highest risk was found for pantoprazole, followed by lansoprazole, omeprazole and esomeprazole. The risk of HE with rabeprazole was not statistically significant but had the largest confidence interval due to a low number of users. Expert judgement There is conflicting data for all outcomes of interest. Only one study provided sub‐analyses for the risk of HE per PPI. Based on these results, it is possible that pharmacokinetic alterations contributed to an increased risk. We advise to cautiously use PPIs in cirrhotics and monitor for these AEs during treatment. Implementation and continuity The practical guidance on PPIs has been implemented in the two national drug databases in the Netherlands in 2017. The first update is planned for 2022. Discussion We developed practical guidance for the safe use of PPIs in patients with cirrhosis based on the product information, literature and expert opinion. Our results show that relevant changes in pharmacokinetics occur due to cirrhosis. Based on the available evidence, we recommend esomeprazole, omeprazole and rabeprazole for use in patients with CTP A and B cirrhosis. In CTP C cirrhosis, we recommend to prescribe only esomeprazole whereas the use of lansoprazole and pantoprazole in all patients with cirrhosis is discouraged because of increased exposure compared to non‐cirrhotics. Our advice is based on evidence from both the pharmacokinetic and safety literatures. We found no studies that combined pharmacokinetic data with pharmacodynamic data. Literature shows that the AUC is the best pharmacokinetic parameter predicting gastric acid suppression  14 ,  15 . The main question is whether increased acid suppression is a safety risk for patients with cirrhosis, an issue that is virtually not covered in the product information. In the included studies, most AEs were mild, but there were cases of HE that were attributed to PPI use. However, the causality is unclear since HE is a central feature of advanced cirrhosis. Almost all of these events occurred in patients on a relatively high dose or in patients with advanced cirrhosis. Some articles examining the safety of PPIs as a group also assessed dose‐dependent safety  8 ,  78 ,  81 ,  84 ,  87 ,  92 ,  93 . Results were conflicting. One study performed a sub‐analysis for assessing the risk of HE per PPI  8 . They found the highest risk of HE with pantoprazole and no significant risk with rabeprazole. The risk of HE for the remaining PPIs was comparable. An important consideration for the expert panel was not to expose cirrhotic patients to unnecessary risks. Highly increased exposure was considered a safety risk when used in non‐acute settings; hence for daily practice we discourage the oral use of lansoprazole and pantoprazole in cirrhosis and recommend the use of PPIs without these large increases, such as esomeprazole. Our results demonstrate major pharmacokinetic alterations in patients with cirrhosis compared to healthy controls. Although maximum plasma concentrations were often comparable between cirrhotics and healthy controls, the exposure (AUC) and elimination half‐life differed to a great extent between the two groups. All PPIs are metabolized by CYP2C19 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4. CYP2C19 is very sensitive to impairment of liver function  96 . Reduced activity of CYP2C19 is probably the most important cause of the observed pharmacokinetic changes. There were also significant differences found between PPIs. The changes in pharmacokinetics were largest for lansoprazole and pantoprazole. Both have a low hepatic extraction ratio, while the other PPIs have an intermediate hepatic extraction ratio  13 ,  31 . In contrast to drugs with an intermediate hepatic extraction ratio, hepatic clearance of drugs with a low hepatic extraction ratio is mostly dependent on intrinsic metabolic clearance (i.e. activity of metabolizing enzymes) and on protein binding. Drugs with a low hepatic extraction ratio are therefore most vulnerable to changes in the activity of hepatic metabolizing enzymes and in protein binding  13 . Esomeprazole pharmacokinetics seemed to be least influenced by cirrhosis. It is remarkable that results of esomeprazole and omeprazole differ. This can be explained by differences in metabolism between the S‐enantiomer and the R‐enantiomer of omeprazole, as the S‐enantiomer (esomeprazole) is metabolized to a lesser extent by CYP2C19 than the R‐enantiomer  97 . Pharmacogenetic studies with PPIs in healthy volunteers also showed that exposure of esomeprazole is least affected by CYP2C19 polymorphisms compared to other PPIs  98 ,  99 . The literature search identified many studies that determine the risk of HE, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and/or infections in patients with cirrhosis using PPIs. Most of these were observational and cross‐sectional by design and provide conflicting results. The nature and quality of the data do not allow a formal meta‐analysis, which precluded a direct comparison. Cautious use of PPIs in these patients is recommended by most authors. Of note is that only one of the 37 studies examined safety risks for each individual PPI, while eight did investigate whether safety risks were dose‐dependent. In our opinion, a sub‐analysis on the dose‐dependency of the risk of HE or infections cannot be calculated in the absence of pharmacokinetic data. For further studies, determining the risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, HE or infections for each PPI would be advisable. A strength of our study is that we are not only reviewing the literature, but also developing practical guidance for health care professionals by combining literature and registration information with expert opinion. For some outcomes (e.g. pharmacokinetics in CTP C patients), our recommendations are limited by the few studies available. Therefore, continuous update of data and advice is warranted. Another strength is that the method used for combining all these data has been peer‐reviewed and published  16 . A limitation of this method is that a number of steps were performed by a single author (R.W.). The most critical steps (i.e. data synthesis, advice formulation) were however, double checked by a second person (S.B.). Interpretation of the findings, discussion and conclusion was in all cases done by a multi‐disciplinary expert panel. We provided safety and dosing guidance for the oral use of PPIs in patients with cirrhosis which can be applied in daily practice. The pharmacokinetic properties of PPIs are affected by the presence of cirrhosis. The combination of pharmacokinetic and safety data used in this study is unique and sheds new light on the current discussion about the safety of PPIs in patients with cirrhosis.

    <Body>Hundreds of researchers are working to develop a vaccine and are evaluating drugs to mitigate the adverse health and economic consequences of COVID‐19 (Coronavirus disease 19) worldwide. If novel compounds are found, geopolitical and economic variables will determine their introduction to communities. Therefore, finding low‐cost and widely accessible drugs for prevention or treatment of COVID‐19 would be ideal. A recent study found that ivermectin, an FDA‐approved anti‐parasitic drug, has inhibitory effects on replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2).

  Ivermectin has broad anti‐viral activity through inhibition of viral proteins including importin α/β1 heterodimer and integrase protein.

  Caly and colleagues reported that the addition of ivermectin at a concentration of 5μM (twice the reported IC 50 ) to Vero‐hSLAM cells, 2 h post infection with SARS‐CoV‐2, resulted in a reduction in the viral RNA load by 99.98% at 48 h. 
 1 
  The authors suggested that this drug could reduce the viral load in infected patients, with potential effect on disease progression and spread. While the findings by Caly and colleagues provide some promise, several pharmacokinetic factors limit the immediate translation of their findings, and there is no evidence that the 5μM concentration of ivermectin used by Caly and colleagues in their in vitro SARS‐CoV‐2 experiment, can be achieved in vivo. First, the pharmacokinetics of ivermectin in humans is well described,

  and even with the highest reported dose of approximately 1700 μg/kg (i.e., 8.5 times the FDA‐approved dose of 200 μg/kg), the maximum plasma concentration was only 0.28μM. 
 5 
  Second, 93% of ivermectin is bound to plasma proteins that limit its cellular uptake by endothelial cells. 
 6 
  Considering both the total plasma concentration and protein binding, the free plasma concentration of ivermectin would be 250 times lower than the concentration required to reduce viral replication of SARS‐CoV‐2 in vitro (Figure  1 ). Third, whilst there is no data on the tissue penetration of ivermectin in human lungs, the total concentration of ivermectin in calves injected with 200 μg/kg reached only 100 ng/g (approx. 0.1μM) in lung tissue, which suggests that its accumulation would not be sufficient to achieve the antiviral effect with conventional doses.

  Although high doses of ivermectin in adults or children are well tolerated,

  the clinical effects of ivermectin at a concentration of 5μM range are unknown and may be associated with toxicity. Consequently, ivermectin has in vitro activity against SARS‐CoV‐2, but this effect is unlikely to be observed in vivo using current dosing.

  When necessary, an estimated body weight of 70 kg was used for calculations. Note that none of the doses reached the 5μM concentration required for the antiviral effect of ivermectin (dotted line) Amidst fear of the pandemic, the public and some physicians are now using ivermectin off‐label for prophylaxis or as adjuvant therapy for COVID‐19. Because ivermectin is only commercially available as a 3 or 6 mg tablets or a 6 mg/ml oral suspension, in order to administer a high dose, some people may experiment with more concentrated veterinary formulations. These actions are not based on clinical trials and have motivated cautionary statements from institutions such as the FDA against the use of pharmaceutical formulations of ivermectin intended for animals as therapeutics in humans.

 Potential avenues for further investigation into repurposing ivermectin for SARS‐CoV‐2 may be to (i) develop an inhaled formulation to efficiently deliver a high local concentration in the lung, whilst minimizing systemic exposure and (ii) evaluate synergistic effects of ivermectin with other compounds that also inhibit SARS‐CoV‐2 replication. With 18 registered clinical trials ( clinicaltrials.gov ) evaluating ivermectin for the treatment of COVID‐19, this letter highlights the critical need to consider pharmacological principles to guide in vitro and clinical testing when repurposing old drugs for therapeutic use for the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic.

    <Body>WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT Cluster randomized trials (randomized policy design studies) can be used to compare the safety and effectiveness of different interventions. Cluster randomized trials are relatively novel in the context of studying drug interventions. Using cluster randomized trials to investigate drug safety and effectiveness would require public and primary-care practitioner co-operation. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS The general public in Scotland is broadly supportive of the concept of cluster randomized trials (randomized policy design studies) to improve understanding of comparative effectiveness and safety of medicines within the National Health Service. There is a spread of opinion among general practitioners in Scotland regarding the acceptability of the concept of cluster randomized trials in the field of drug safety and effectiveness. Of the general public participants, 97% agreed that the National Health Service has a duty to determine the safety and effectiveness of the medicines its doctors prescribe. Introduction Obtaining data on the comparative effectiveness and safety of different drug therapies within the National Health Service (NHS) is essential to make correct and cost-effective decisions regarding treatment recommendations. The ideal way to gather this information is to use routinely collected data in real-life patients who are representative of the whole population of patients within the NHS. Clinical trial populations sometimes have poor external validity due to selection of subjects using inclusion and exclusion criteria and the different trial participation behaviours of different types of patients [ 1 ], while observational data are often confounded by other factors that are difficult to control for [ 2 ,  3 ]. One way of collecting data inexpensively and with good external validity for extrapolation to the general population is to introduce policy changes that randomize groups of patients (i.e. at practice level) within the usual NHS system to different treatments, then compare outcomes using routinely collected data; so-called ‘randomized policy design’ or ‘cluster randomized studies’[ 4 ]. The advantages of cluster randomized studies are that they take account of between-patient variability within a cluster. They also better reflect usual care interventions and thus have better external validity [ 5 ]. The downside of cluster randomization is that there is loss of statistical power because the unit of analysis must be the unit of randomization; thus, they usually need to be much larger studies. There has been an increasing interest in cluster randomized trials over the past 20 years [ 6 ]. Using this model, two established therapies can be compared, or a new therapy can be compared with an established therapy using effective record-linkage techniques. This is done by randomizing certain primary-care practices to use one therapy in their patients, while other practices continue to use the usual existing therapy in their patients. Alternatively, the same intervention can be introduced to all practices, but the implementation delayed in half of the practices [ 7 ]. Patients in all of the participating practices are then followed up for the events of interest, and the rates of events in the two therapy groups are compared. If wide participation of general practices and patients were achieved, research questions could be answered quickly and inexpensively. While we believe that randomized policy design studies would be ideal for studying the comparative effectiveness and safety of drug therapies within the UK NHS system, we felt that it was important to gather the opinions of the general public and general practitioners (GPs) on this subject. To assess public opinion, a survey was conducted in the Scottish general population. Participants were asked questions about their views on randomized policy design studies and changes being made to their prescribed medicines. We also surveyed general practitioners in Scotland to ascertain their attitudes towards the concept of randomized policy design studies to improve understanding of comparative effectiveness and safety of medicines. Methods Two separate surveys were carried out in May 2010. A general population survey was conducted by mruk research as part of a monthly Scottish Consumer Omnibus Survey. mruk research is a market research agency that conducts surveys in samples of the general population. The distribution of sample points was in line with the geographic spread of the population and was collected from 52 constituency-based sample points. Interviews were conducted using CAWI (computer-aided web interviewing) technology. One interview was conducted per household, and quotas were imposed on age and gender to reflect the population. One thousand and forty people took part in the survey. This sample size allowed proportions to be estimated within a margin of error of 3%. The structured sample in terms of gender and age distribution is presented in  Table 1 . In order to understand the nature of the population surveyed better, participants were also asked to report whether they had any long-term medical condition. Interviews were conducted between 10 and 20 May 2010. The questions included in the survey are listed in  Table 2 . Table 1  Population distribution by age and gender in the general population survey  Age group (years) Male [ n  (%)] Female [ n  (%)] Total [ n  (%)] 16–24 43 (8.0) 101 (20.0) 144 (13.9) 25–34 59 (11.0) 144 (28.5) 203 (19.5) 35–44 107 (20.0) 99 (19.6) 206 (19.8) 45–54 123 (23.0) 57 (11.3) 180 (17.3) 55–64 111 (20.8) 24 (4.8) 135 (13.0) 65+ 92 (17.2) 80 (15.8) 172 (16.5) Total 535 (100.0) 505 (100.0) 1040 (100.0) Table 2  Questions included in the general population survey  Scenario Imagine you are a patient with a medical condition for which you take Drug A long term. Another drug, Drug B, is also available for this condition. It is very similar to Drug A and also works well for this medical condition. The NHS in Scotland wants to know if there is any difference between Drug A and Drug B. Letter The following letter from NHS Scotland comes to you in the post, via your GP: NHS Scotland is working to find the best treatment for a range of medical conditions. In line with this policy, your prescription for Drug A will be changed to Drug B at your next prescription renewal. Your care will otherwise remain unchanged. 
 Thank you for your co-operation in this matter.

None of these Data to be recorded for each respondent • Age • Sex • Presence of a long-term medical condition (free text entry if willing to give any details) The general practitioner survey was conducted by writing to a 20% random sample of general practitioners within Scotland ( n  = 1034) in May 2010 with the single question, ‘Assuming that the clinical topics are well chosen and that patient follow-up can be automated as much as possible, what is your view on randomized drug formulary policy changes as a tool for improving drug prescribing?’ General practitioners were asked to indicate on a form whether they were ‘in favour’, ‘undecided’ or ‘not in favour’ of this concept. They were also invited to make any additional free-text comments on the concept, then to return the form to us in a reply-paid envelope. Data are reported as numbers and percentages. Chi-squared test was used to determine the statistical difference between the groups. Results General population survey One thousand and forty people were asked the questions listed in  Table 2 . When asked what would be their reaction to receiving a letter regarding NHS Scotland changing their prescription drug therapy at next prescription renewal in line with a policy of finding the best treatment for a range of medical conditions (Q1), 30% of people said they would be happy, 39% unhappy and 31% would not mind or had no opinion on it. There was a significant difference between women and men, with a higher proportion of women saying they would be unhappy (44% women  vs . 35% men,  P  &lt; 0.01). Participants were then asked how acceptable different reasons for changing their drug therapy would be to them (irrespective of their answer to the first question; Q2). The vast majority of people (96%) found the reasons of ‘a change to a more effective drug’ or ‘a change to a safer drug’ to be acceptable. Men tended to find ‘a change to a cheaper drug’ more acceptable than women (42% men  vs . 35% women,  P  &lt; 0.01) and there were no significant differences in other answers between men and women ( Table 3 ).

Participants were asked whether they agreed that ‘the NHS has a duty to determine the safety and effectiveness of the drugs its doctors prescribe’ (Q3). Ninety-seven per cent of respondents agreed with this statement. Participants were then asked whom they felt had the most responsibility to find out which are the best drug treatments from the options: the NHS in general, my GP practice, my individual GP, drug companies, a UK agency such as the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), a European agency such as the European Medicines Agency or other (Q4). The most popular answers were the NHS in general (62%), a UK agency such as MHRA (57%) and drug companies (48%). Men were more likely than women to agree with the answer of ‘my individual GP’ (25% men  vs . 17% women,  P  &lt; 0.01), while women tended to agree more with the answer of ‘drug companies’ than men (54% women  vs . 43% men,  P  &lt; 0.01;  Figure 1 ). Figure 1 Participants were asked their opinion on whom has the most responsibility to find out which are the best drug treatments. Results are presented as the percentage of positive responses by women (F) and men (M). Abbreviations: EMA, European Medicines Agency; MHRA, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency The principle of comparing the safety and effectiveness of two similar drugs by dividing people who take them into two groups, then following up the results of treatment, was then explained to participants and they were asked whether this would be acceptable or not acceptable to them as a way of comparing drugs (Q5). Seventy-two per cent said that this would be acceptable, 19% not acceptable and 9% had no opinion. There was no gender difference in the answers to this question. Participants were asked whether they would be willing for NHS Scotland to follow up their medical data, with adequate protection in place, so that drug treatments could be compared (Q6). Eighty-one per cent were willing, 9% were not and 10% were unsure. There were no age or gender differences in the answers to this question. In order to correct for any differences in responses to the earlier questions based on personal experience, participants were asked whether they had a medical condition for which they take prescription medicines on a regular basis (Q7; yes 43%, no 56% and declined to answer 1%). If they answered ‘yes’, they were also asked whether they had ever had one of their regular medicines changed by their GP surgery or pharmacist as part of a general policy (Q8; yes 31%, no 60% and unsure 9%) and whether they were asked first (Q9; yes 58%, no 39% and unsure 5%). Those who reported that they had previously had a regular medication changed ( n  = 136) were asked why they think the change was made. They reported the following reasons: ‘the new drug was better’ 44%, ‘the new drug was safer’ 10%, ‘the new drug was cheaper’ 34% and ‘don't know’ 11%. These participants were also asked about their reaction to this change (Q11). The majority (58%) reported that they were ‘happy for their drug to be changed and there were no problems afterwards’. There were significant differences in the answers given to some of the earlier questions (Q1, Q2 and Q4) between the 136 subjects reporting a previous change to their regular medication and the remainder of the study subjects. The subjects reporting a previous change to their regular medication were more likely to be ‘happy’ to receive the letter about prescribing policy change (Q1), more likely to find some of the reasons for changing their medicine ‘acceptable’, namely ‘to find out which drug works better’, ‘to find out which drug is safer’, ‘to compare two older drugs to find the best one’ and ‘to compare a new drug with an older one to find the best one’ (Q2, responses 4–7), and were more likely to nominate ‘my individual GP’ or ‘drug companies’ as having the most responsibility to find out which are the best drug treatments (Q4, responses 3–4). Finally, subjects were asked whether they had a long-term medical condition (Q12) and, if so, to give a brief description. Overall, 58% of subjects said they did not have a long-term condition (69% of women and 49% of men,  P  &lt; 0.01). The types and frequencies of conditions in the participants by percentage are listed in  Table 4 . The five most common types of conditions were blood pressure problems, mental health problems, arthritis, asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/breathing problems and diabetes mellitus. Men had more blood pressure problems, stomach/bowel/reflux problems, cholesterol problems, heart problems/angina and diabetes mellitus than women ( P  &lt; 0.05). Subjects not reporting any long-term conditions were more likely to be ‘unhappy’ than subjects reporting long-term conditions about receiving a letter explaining about randomized policy changes (Q1; 41.8% in the no long-term condition group  vs . 32.5% in the long-term condition group,  P  &lt; 0.01).

General practitioner survey We received 341 replies (33% response rate) from the 1034 general practitioners approached. Of these replies, 154 (45%) general practitioners were ‘in favour’, 65 (19%) were ‘undecided’ and 122 (36%) were ‘not in favour’ of the concept of randomized drug formulary policy changes. Twenty-seven general practitioners returned additional comments on the proposal (six of those in favour of the concept, seven of those undecided and 14 of those not in favour). The majority of these comments, especially from the group of general practitioners not in favour of the concept (11 of 14), referred to the potential extra workload involved for general practitioners. Other negative comments included problems with penalties due to noncompliance with formularies, the lack of electronic formularies, the potential to cause confusion, questionable benefit for patients and consent issues. Two general practitioners expressed a preference to randomize only newly treated patients to therapies rather than change established therapies in treated patients. Positive comments included the need for robust primary-care-based research to underpin treatments and question the risk-to-benefit ratio of long-established treatments, support for using the best and most effective drugs and general indications of support for the idea. Discussion The vast majority of the general public participants agreed that the NHS has a duty to determine the safety and effectiveness of the drugs its doctors prescribe. Traditionally, randomized controlled clinical trials have been seen as the gold-standard way of comparing different therapies. However, these can be very expensive and time consuming and may include a nonrepresentative sample of the population and therefore have poorer external validity than the type of approach described in this paper. Randomized policy design studies to compare different treatments within the NHS could be useful in a number of settings, including the comparison of new treatments with established treatments or the comparison of existing treatments which are widely used but for which we have limited evidence of safety or effectiveness. In some cases, this might be the only realistic way to compare treatments within the real-life NHS setting; for example, for older, cheaper therapies where there is no commercial interest in finding differences in safety or effectiveness, but which are widely used and could therefore have enormous implications for overall patient outcomes and NHS expenditure, e.g. comparing different thiazide diuretics in patients with hypertension. A recent review by Johnston  et al . showed that substitution strategies for antihypertensives have not been tested in large outcome trials and there is little available clinical or economic evidence on which to base decisions to switch drugs [ 8 ]. We believe improved knowledge of effectiveness will translate into improved assessment of cost-effectiveness. Such a mechanism would also be of use in the appraisal of newly marketed medicines. Increasingly, pharmaceutical companies are being asked to carry out postlicensing research to determine the safety and effectiveness of their newly marketed medicines. As cost-effectiveness appraisals drive the prescribing reimbursement of new medicines, postlicensing observational studies cannot be done because the medicine is not prescribed to any extent. Cluster randomization of practices to new medicines  vs . standard therapy would allow a potential solution to this problem, because they could be done relatively quickly and inexpensively. In addition, 50% of practices who participated would be able to give their patients the opportunity to get the most recent medicine. Pharmaceutical companies would be expected to reimburse the cost of the medicines used in such an appraisal phase. This type of design would generate data on the safety and effectiveness  vs . standard therapy and would allow the generation of data that could provide reassurance on safety and robust comparative effectiveness in the setting of normal care. These data would facilitate the capture of cost-effectiveness data that would assist the decision on reimbursement. Recruitment to clinical trials is always difficult [ 9 ]. In randomized policy design studies, patients would be informed that their general practice was participating in a policy change study and given the option to opt out if desired. Performing research of this type driven by randomized policy changes could also encourage participation of more general practices in research. At present, some general practices participate in much research, while others participate in none. In a recent study with minimal input required at the practice level, only one-third of general practices participated [ 10 ]. In more complex studies, requiring additional workload, fewer practices generally choose to participate. In order to gain the answers to important health-related questions in the real-life setting, it is important to achieve widespread participation of primary-care practices in research, with appropriate support for the additional workload involved, as this is usually the main concern preventing participation. Some steps have been taken towards this already, with the introduction of bodies such as the Primary Care Research Networks in the UK. Perhaps further incentives, such as Quality Outcomes Framework points for research activity, should be considered to improve research participation further. However, involvement in medical research is a responsibility of all medical practitioners according to General Medical Council Good Medical Practice guidance, which states that ‘research involving people directly or indirectly is vital in improving care and reducing uncertainty for patients now and in the future, and improving the health of the population as a whole’[ 11 ]. It also states that doctors ‘must help to resolve uncertainties about the effects of treatments’[ 12 ]. However, a major factor in implementing such studies is that they require to be resourced adequately. Changing patient prescription medicines often results in questions, intolerance, requests to stay on current therapy and a host of administrative and other issues that require time and manpower to address. Primary-care physicians will wish to be convinced that the introduction of such evaluations will not increase further their already saturated workload or that extra resources are available to deal with this. Randomized policy studies raise certain ethical issues, which have been discussed in detail elsewhere [ 4 ]. Mainly, these involve the lack of individual informed consent and the use of opt-out systems instead. However, issues such as these have previously been addressed to enable effective research to take place using primary-care data, e.g. General Practice Research Database in the UK ( http://www.gprd.com ). As the results of our survey show, many patients taking long-term prescription medicines are familiar with policy changes being made to their regular medications by their practices (often as a result of formulary initiatives), and it seems from our results that many patients do not object to changes being made for a good reason, particularly if it is to improve safety or effectiveness. In fact, there is little evidence in the literature to assess patient views on such formulary changes to date [ 13 ]. The main concerns from general practitioners were around the potential additional workload involved. The results of this survey are broadly in keeping with our experience of involving GP practices in formal randomized controlled trials. Conclusions The results of the surveys suggest that the general population within Scotland is broadly supportive of the concept of randomized policy design studies to determine the safety and effectiveness of drug treatments within the NHS, while there is a spread of opinion among general practitioners. The next step may be to perform one of these types of studies, to answer an important and widely relevant question in medicine, then further determine the acceptability of this method of studying drug effectiveness and safety with both the public and health professionals. </Body>

    <Body>What is Already Known about this Subject 
 Recently, the impact of inflammation and organ failure on cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A‐mediated midazolam metabolism has been quantified in critically ill children. Before population pharmacokinetic models can be used for clinical decision making and deriving dosing recommendations, they should be thoroughly evaluated in external datasets. 
 What this Study Adds 
 Metabolic midazolam clearance can be accurately predicted in critically ill term neonates, infants and children using C‐reactive protein level and the number of failing organs. While extrapolation to preterm neonates on the basis of this model leads to considerable overprediction of metabolic midazolam clearance, extrapolation to adults and patients beyond the studied disease severity levels yielded unbiased midazolam clearance predictions. 
 Introduction Various studies suggest that cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A)‐mediated drug metabolism may be reduced by inflammation and disease  1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 . Decreases in CYP3A‐mediated clearance may result in overdosing and side effects in certain patient populations. A previous study in critically ill children showed substantially reduced CYP3A‐mediated clearance of midazolam in patients with inflammation and organ failure  6 . A population pharmacokinetic (PK) model for midazolam was developed, based on data both from critically ill term neonates and children between 0 and 17 years of age who were on mechanical ventilator support  6 . Increased inflammation, reflected by a 10‐fold increase in the inflammatory marker C‐reactive protein (CRP) concentrations from 32 mg l –1  to 300 mg l –1 , was found to correlate with a 50% reduction in midazolam clearance in this population. Furthermore, an increase in disease severity, reflected by the number of failing organs (cardiovascular, renal, respiratory, haematological and/or hepatic failure), e.g. increasing from one to three or &gt;3, correlates with 35% or 47% reduced midazolam clearance, respectively (Figure  1 ). Figure 1 Model‐predicted paediatric midazolam clearance for different levels of inflammation, as reflected by C‐reactive protein (CRP) concentrations of 10 mg l –1 , 32 mg l –1  and 300 mg l –1  (top to bottom), and disease severity scenarios, reflected by number of organ failures To allow population models to be used for clinical decision making (e.g. for deriving dosing recommendations), they should be evaluated thoroughly  7 ,  8 ,  9 . Without proper validation and evaluation, models can only be regarded as descriptive rather than predictive, thereby limiting their safe use for clinical and research applications  8 . Three categories in model evaluation with increasing order of quality have been described  9 ,  10 ,  11 : basic internal methods, advanced internal methods and external model evaluation. Marsot  et al .  10  found that only 10% of the population models in paediatric subjects from neonates to 2 years of age developed up to 2010 were evaluated externally, even though this step is essential if the model is to be used to predict adequate dosing regimens in routine clinical practice. An external validation is based on new data that were not used for model development. A valid population model should at least be able to predict accurately data from patients with a distribution of characteristics (e.g. weight/age range or disease severity) comparable with those of the patient population included in model development  8 . When a model is applied to predict pharmacokinetics in individuals with characteristics outside the range of the population used in model development, this not an external validation, but a form of extrapolation and this may affect the model's predictions in the new population  12 . The previously developed PK model for quantifying CYP3A‐mediated midazolam clearance in critically ill children  6  has the potential to define midazolam dosing regimens that reliably achieve target plasma concentrations. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the predictive performance of the population PK model in external data from patients with the same patient characteristics as in the original model (i.e. critically ill children, infants and term neonates). Moreover, the extrapolation potential of the model was investigated by evaluating its predictive performance in populations beyond the studied age range (i.e. preterm neonates or adults) and disease severity (healthy state). Methods Patients and data From the literature, data from six studies were available that could be used for this external validation and extrapolation study  13 ,  14 ,  15 ,  16 ,  17 ,  18 . These studies covered different patient populations, ranging largely in age from preterm neonates to adults with different disease severity levels. All studies had been approved by ethics committees, and informed (parental) consent had been obtained. Table  1  gives an overview of the patient and study characteristics of the available data for external validation  13 ,  14  and extrapolation  15 ,  16 ,  17 ,  18  as well as of the internal data from the original model development  6  as a comparison. The new data included 136 preterm neonates, infants, children and adults, all of whom received intravenous midazolam. Organ failure, scored from 0–5, was defined based on a maximum sub‐score for cardiovascular, renal, respiratory, haematological and hepatic failure on the paediatric logistic organ dysfunction (PELOD) score  19  for the paediatric subjects or on the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score  20  for the adult subjects. For all study participants, information on respiratory function was known, while information on the function of other organs or on CRP levels was not always reported. For missing CRP data in preterm neonates and healthy adult volunteers, values for a healthy individual were assumed (i.e. a CRP concentration of 10 mg l –1 ). In the case of missing sub‐scores on organ dysfunction, it was assumed that there was no organ failure. For missing CRP values in critically ill adults  18 , a CRP concentration of 32 mg l –1  was assumed, which was the median CRP value in the previously reported model  6  (Table  1 ; see section on original model, below). In total, 10 observations from two individuals were discarded because of a substantial increase in the plasma midazolam concentration without a recorded prior dosing event; for at least one individual, this was known to be due to flushing of the intravenous line in the contralateral arm before sampling.

For a median patient of 5 kg body weight, with a CRP concentration of 32 mg l –1  and one failing organ, clearance was 1.29 l h –1 
 6 . Individual clearance (CL) was quantified as follows:
 (1) CL i = CL 5 kg × WT i / 5 1.02 × CRP i / 32 – 0.312 in which CL 5 kg  varies for different numbers of failing organs, with a value of 1.29 l h –1 , 0.96 l h –1 , 0.83 l h –1  or 0.67 l h –1  for one, two, three or &gt;3 failing organs, respectively, WT i  is the body weight (in kg) of individual  i , and CRP i  is the CRP concentration (in mg l –1 ) of this individual. This corresponds to a clearance of 19.0 l h –1  for an individual with a body weight of 70 kg, a CRP concentration of 32 mg l –1  and one failing organ. The volume of distribution in the central compartment for individual  i  was:
 (2) V1 i l = 3.28 · WT i / 5 1.34 corresponding to 113 l for a 70 kg individual, and the peripheral distribution volume and intercompartmental clearance were 5.44 l and 1.52 l h – 1, respectively. Model evaluation The predictive performance of the PK model was evaluated using several tools. First, we obtained population and individual concentration predictions using the model and its published model parameters in NONMEM (version 7.3, ICON, Ellicott City, MD, USA). Using R (version 3.2.2) and R‐studio (version 0.98.1078), goodness‐of‐fit plots were constructed. Concentration predictions were compared visually with the observed concentrations, and the distribution of conditionally weighted residuals (CWRES)  vs . the population prediction of the plasma concentrations and  vs . time were assessed visually. When model predictions are unbiased, CWRES are randomly distributed around zero. Additionally, we plotted individual and population clearance predictions  vs . the most dominant covariate (i.e. body weight), to assess the accuracy of the covariate model. Furthermore, bias was calculated per dataset by taking the median of the prediction error (PE):
 (3) PE = pred − obs × 100 obs in which  pred  is the predicted concentration or the individually predicted clearance, and  obs  the observed concentration or the population‐predicted clearance to evaluate the PE in concentration and clearance, respectively. An MPE of &lt;30% was considered to be an accurate prediction. Moreover, a normalized prediction distribution error (NPDE) analysis was performed using the NPDE package in R  21 . For each observed concentration in the external datasets, 1000 midazolam concentrations were simulated. The simulations were based on the dosing regimen, body weight, CRP concentrations and level of organ failure of the patients, and on the parameter values, including interindividual and residual variability, that were obtained for the original model (Table  2 ). These 1000 predicted concentrations were compared with the observed concentrations in the external datasets. For accurate concentration predictions, the mean of the NPDE is expected to be 0 and an adequate description of the variability in the model is expected to yield a variance in the NPDE distribution of 1.

 −40.6 −1.67 a The MPE is the median of the prediction error, which reflects for plasma concentrations the difference in observed and predicted concentrations (see Methods, Eq.  (3) ). For clearance, the difference in individual predicted and population‐predicted clearance is calculated Results Overall, 1045 plasma concentrations from 136 subjects, aged between 1 day and 84 years, with a body weight ranging from 0.77 kg to 90 kg, were available for the external validation and extrapolation (Table  1 )  13 ,  14 ,  15 ,  16 ,  17 ,  18 . To compare, Table  1  also shows the data used for development of the original model, which were collected in 83 critically ill term neonates and children, ranging in age from 1 day to 17 years  6 . The subjects for the external validation included 18 critically ill children  13  and 26 children following cardiac bypass surgery  14 , who were within the age and body weight range of the model building dataset and had comparable CRP concentrations and levels of organ failure. Furthermore, 55 preterm neonates ranging in age between 1 day and 44 days  15 ,  16 , 17 critically ill adults without alcohol abuse  18  and 20 healthy adults  17  were included to evaluate the extrapolation potential of the model predictions to patients outside the studied age and weight range and with different levels of disease severity. The model described midazolam concentrations in the original dataset (Figure  2 , panels A and B) and was able to predict midazolam clearance and plasma concentrations without bias in critically ill children  13  and children after cardiac bypass surgery  14  (Figure  2 , panels C–F). In addition, no trends were observed in CWRES  vs . predicted plasma concentrations (plot not shown), confirming that there was no bias in the peak and trough concentration predictions. In addition, the MPE was &lt;30% for both concentrations and clearances (Table  2 ). The NPDE results indicated that model predictions are accurate without trends over time or concentration range (see  Figure S1 ). The mean of the NPDE for both populations was not significantly different from 0 (0.034 and −0.062, respectively), while the variance of the variability in the external data was statistically significantly larger than predicted by the model (2.24 and 1.95, respectively). This indicates that the concentrations in the population were accurately predicted, but that more variability is observed in the new data than is predicted by the model. Figure  3  shows that the individual clearance predictions (data points), which are based on the patient's level of inflammation and organ failure, are scattered around the population clearance predictions for patients with varying body weight and a CRP concentration of 32 mg l –1  and one failing organ (black line).

 Figure 3 Population (line) and individual (symbols) predicted clearance  vs . the patient's body weight. The population prediction assumes an individual with a C‐reactive protein (CRP) concentration of 32 mg l –1  and one failing organ. The grey shaded area indicates the range of population‐predicted clearance values from the healthiest patients [without inflammation (CRP 10 mg l –1 ) and without organ failure] (upper boundary) to the patient with the most severe disease state (CRP 300 mg l –1  and &gt;3 failing organs) (lower boundary) The model building dataset included term neonates, but no preterm neonates  22 . Extrapolation of model predictions to preterm neonates without inflammation or organ failure resulted in underprediction of the high plasma concentrations at early time points (Figure  2 , panels G and H), with an MPE &gt;60% for both datasets (Table  2 ). The NPDE results also indicated biased model predictions and an underprediction of the variability (Figure  S1 , panels J–L). Figure  3  shows that clearance was generally overpredicted for this population. When the model was used for extrapolation to healthy adults without organ failure and an assumed CRP concentration of 10 mg l –1 , midazolam clearances were within the predicted range (MPE &lt;30%), albeit at the upper range, which may be expected given their normal CRP concentrations and lack of organ failure (Figure  3 ). However, in the population‐predicted  vs . observed plot (Figure  2 I), the CWRES  vs . time plot (Figure  2 J) and the CWRES  vs . population‐predicted concentration plot (not shown), a biphasic trend was observed, causing a large overprediction of peak and trough concentrations, and underprediction of other plasma concentrations, which is suggestive of a misspecification of drug distribution. The NPDE (Figure  S1 , panels M–O) also indicated this model misspecification for healthy adults. For critically ill adults with varying levels of organ failure and an assumed CRP concentration of 32 mg l –1 , midazolam clearances were also predicted within the range (MPE &lt;30%), although in the lower range (Figure  3 ). Furthermore, the plasma concentrations were predicted with reasonable accuracy (Figure  2 , panels K and L). However, the NPDE also showed some model misspecification (the mean distribution error is significantly different from 0; see  Figure S1 ), which may result from inappropriate information on drug distribution. Discussion In the present analysis, the predictive performance and extrapolation potential of a recently developed population PK model for midazolam, quantifying CYP3A‐mediated clearance in critically ill children  6 , were evaluated. According to the applied model evaluation methods, midazolam clearance and plasma concentrations are well predicted in external data from critically ill children, infants and term neonates, and children after cardiac bypass surgery who are in the same age range and have similar levels of inflammation and organ failure. Extrapolation to subjects outside the age range and with different levels of disease severity resulted in biased clearance for preterm neonates and biased concentration predictions in healthy adults. Extrapolation to subjects outside the age range with similar levels of disease severity (e.g. critically ill adults) resulted in adequate clearance predictions (Figure  3 ). To our knowledge, the evaluated PK model  6  in the present study is the first model to describe and quantify the relationship between inflammation and organ failure on midazolam clearance in children. As in the model, besides maturation, both inflammation and organ failure proved to be of relevance, and these factors could be relevant for the dosing of CYP3A substrates. However, model evaluation is essential before a model can be used for clinical decision making, such as developing dosing recommendations  7 ,  8 ,  9 ,  10 . Ideally, a prospective study, with more subjects for external evaluation, should be undertaken, to ensure that patient characteristics and covariate information are recorded in a standard way. However, with literature data available  13 ,  14 ,  15 ,  16 ,  17 ,  18 , it would be unethical and unnecessary to put additional burden on these vulnerable paediatric critically ill patients by performing another PK study  23 . The external validation of this model in cohorts of critically ill paediatric patients and infants after cardiac bypass surgery also confirmed the accuracy of the relationships obtained in patients who were not included in model building. The PK model predicted a 30% decrease in midazolam clearance when CRP concentrations that reflect the presence of inflammation increase threefold from 32 mg l –1  to 100 mg l –1 , irrespective of the cause of elevated CRP concentrations, which could be respiratory disorders, cardiac disorders, sepsis or (non‐)cardiac surgery  6 . Clearance decreased by 26% when disease severity, expressed as the number of failing organs, increased from one to two (Figure  1 ). Cardiovascular, renal, respiratory, haematological and hepatic failure each contributed to the number of failing organs, in which e.g. cardiac failure and mechanical ventilation may cause changes in cardiac output, thereby having an impact on midazolam clearance. As during an intensive care unit (ICU) stay, the number of failing organs and CRP concentrations may change over time, thereby influencing midazolam clearance, so drug dosing in clinical practice may require adjustments over time, assuming the same effective concentration. In any case, it seems advisable to monitor the effects of midazolam during the ICU stay in patients with major inflammation and/or organ failure. This may be especially relevant in preterm neonates, as there are known risks for adverse neurological effects due to the immaturity of γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. By evaluating the effects both in children and adults, the fact that target plasma concentrations may be influenced by inflammation or organ failure is also taken into account. Whether these results for midazolam also apply to other CYP3A substrates needs further study, and therapeutic drug monitoring may be required in the case of a small therapeutic window for the CYP3A substrate involved. Many PK studies on the CYP3A substrate midazolam  24 ,  25 ,  26  have been performed in children over the past two decades  27 ,  28 ,  29 ,  30 ,  31 ,  32 ,  33 ,  34 ,  35 ,  36 ,  37 , ranging from critically ill children to relatively healthy children undergoing elective surgery, and we compared our clearance predictions to the reported clearance values in the literature, from studies up to 25 years ago (Figure  4 ). The clearance values predicted by our model were within the reported ranges, albeit in the lower range and with high variability. High interindividual variability in clearance in children is partly due to maturation of CYP3A‐mediated metabolism  38 , but CYP3A activity is also known to be downregulated by inflammatory cytokines  in vitro 
 3 . The reasons for our model predictions being generally lower than the paediatric values reported in the literature (Figure  4 ) might have been due to differences in disease states, as the ‘healthiest’ children in our study still had one failing organ and were still admitted to the ICU, while reported values in the literature mainly originated from non‐ICU children. This suggests that within a certain age and weight range, the disease state is relevant for drug dosing. For example, for paediatric oncology patients with acute‐phase inflammatory disease, a decreased midazolam clearance has been reported  39 , while for relatively healthy children undergoing elective craniofacial surgery, a much higher midazolam clearance has been reported  28 . Figure 4 Population predicted clearance (oblique line)  vs . the patient's body weight compared with literature‐reported clearance values (open squares with error bars)  28 ,  29 ,  30 ,  31 ,  32 ,  33 ,  34 ,  35 ,  36 ,  37 . The population prediction assumes an individual with a C‐reactive protein (CRP) concentration of 32 mg l –1  and one failing organ. The grey shaded area indicates the range of population‐predicted clearance values from the healthiest patients [without inflammation (CRP 10 mg l –1 ) and without organ failure] (upper boundary) to the patient with the most severe disease state (CRP 300 mg l –1  and &gt;3 failing organs) (lower boundary). The squares represent the reported clearance for a mean body weight. The horizontal error bars represent the included body weight range or the body weight range derived from the patient's age  42 ,  43 ,  44 . Vertical error bars represent the total range of reported clearances or, in the case of one study, the 95% confidence interval. Literature data were obtained after a search of PubMed, with keywords including midazolam, clearance, paediatric, children and pharmacokinetics, and additional studies were identified from reviews and summarizing studies  27 ,  45 ,  46 ,  47 ,  48 ,  49 ,  50 . Studies published up to 25 years ago were included if paediatric subjects in the study received intravenously administered midazolam. Studies with only preterm neonates and patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation treatment were excluded A limitation of comparing results with literature values is that some studies report only summarized clearance data, which are less informative than individual data. Moreover, the clearance values described in the literature are mostly reported per kg body weight  29 ,  30 ,  31 ,  32 ,  33 ,  34 ,  35 ,  36 ,  37 , without reporting the individual body weight values or body weight ranges  32 ,  33 ,  35 ,  37 . Furthermore, detailed information on inflammation and/or organ failure is missing in these studies. The external validation of our model confirmed accurate predictions of the pharmacokinetics of midazolam in critically ill children. However, the results also showed that the model should not be used for extrapolations to younger populations or populations with different levels of disease severity. Clearance was largely overpredicted in preterm neonates with a body weight below 3.5 kg and a gestational age of less than 37 weeks, which is likely to be due to biased maturation predictions of CYP3A activity and/or abundance in these young patients, or possibly the lower level of inflammation and organ failure in this patient group. Owing to rapid maturation after birth, which is not accounted for in our model, CYP3A capacity is likely to be overpredicted in our model. Based on the current data, however, it is not possible to discriminate between maturation and disease severity in this population. The disease state in the neonatal ICU population is known to be highly diverse, and, unfortunately, information on CRP levels was not available for most of the preterm infants. Assuming CRP values lower than 10 mg l –1  would result in higher predictions of clearance, rather than lower clearance, and with more failing organs (e.g. 1–4), the predicted clearance would be up to 47.3% lower, while the observed clearances in this population are even lower. Therefore, until the additional maturation processes in preterm neonates are accounted for in the model, it should not be used for extrapolation to this very young and critically ill population. The extrapolation to adults included healthy and critically ill subjects alike. In the healthy adult population, clearance was well predicted, assuming normal CRP levels and the lack of organ failure that would be expected (Figure  3 ); however, the drug distribution was misspecified, resulting in a clear trend in the CWRES  vs . time plot (Figure  2 J). This biphasic trend suggests that an additional peripheral compartment is required to describe the distribution after a single (semi‐) bolus dose applied in adults. In the healthy volunteer study, more samples were taken directly after dosing, possibly allowing for the identification of relatively fast‐equilibrating peripheral compartments (Figure  2 J). In critically ill adults who were less densely sampled, this trend in CWRES was indeed not observed (Figure  2 L). Other possible explanations for these observations could be altered plasma protein binding in critically ill patients, which may alter drug distribution or capillary leaking in such patients  40 ; this may result in ultra‐fast equilibration of central and peripheral compartments. This ultra‐fast equilibration in these patients prevents the identification of peripheral compartments that can be identified in healthy patients without capillary leaking. In critically ill adults, midazolam clearance values were predicted in the lower range of the expected clearance values (Figure  3 ). This indicates that, despite the different age and weight range in the external validation data, the model was able to predict clearance in the critically ill adults with similar levels of inflammation and organ failure. Some limitations of the present extrapolation study should be acknowledged. As CRP concentrations were not available for all studies, the assumption was made that in healthy adults and preterm neonates, CRP was 10 mg l –1  and that in critically ill adults this inflammation marker had the median value of the internal dataset, of 32 mg l –1 . To assess the impact of different CRP concentrations on clearance predictions, model‐based simulations were performed, with CRP values of 10 mg l –1  and 300 mg l –1  (see Figure  3 , outer boundaries of the grey area). For preterm neonates in the neonatal ICU, assuming CRP values of 1 mg l –1  or 300 mg l –1  would both result in the overprediction of midazolam clearance (probably due to immature CYP3A in this population), while for critically ill adults, assuming a value of 10 mg l –1  or 300 mg l –1 , yields an prediction of their clearance values within the predicted range (Figure  3 , grey area). The model should therefore not be extrapolated to preterm infants. In our study, we could not account for genetic variation in CYP3A4/5 activity, as in the original dataset the variability in genotype was too low to identify a statistically significant impact of CYP3A4/5 genotype on midazolam clearance, and in the datasets of the current study, information on genotype was not available. However, in the literature it has been suggested that patients with expression of functional CYP3A5 metabolize midazolam faster and may compensate for the suppression of CYP3A4 activity due to inflammation or organ failure  41 . These genotypes may also be of relevance in the different populations studied here but, given the data obtained in the present study, this could neither be confirmed nor rejected. Finally, despite the adequate extrapolation potential of our model to the patient populations included in the current study, it should be noted that extrapolation to (special) populations not included in the current analysis (e.g. obese patients, pregnant women) is not warranted without first formally evaluating the extrapolation potential to these populations. Conclusion The recently published paediatric PK model for midazolam, quantifying the influence of maturation, inflammation and organ failure, can be used for predictions of CYP3A‐mediated midazolam clearance in term neonates, children and adults with varying levels of critical illness, including infants after cardiac bypass surgery and healthy adults. Using the model for extrapolation resulted in biased predictions of clearance in preterm neonates. The predictive performance of our model and its value for the development of paediatric dosing regimens for midazolam and potentially other CYP3A substrates was therefore confirmed for term neonates, infants, children and adults with varying levels of critical illness.

    <Body>What is Already Known about this Subject 
 Interleukin (IL)‐17A, and potentially IL‐17F, are believed to drive pathogenesis in psoriasis. Targeting the IL‐17 pathway with anti‐IL‐17A antibodies has demonstrated clinical efficacy in subjects with moderate‐to‐severe psoriasis. Inhibition of the IL‐17 pathway may leave subjects more vulnerable to infection; neutropenia is a potential anti‐IL‐17 class effect. 
 What this Study Adds 
 First demonstration of safety, tolerability and clinical efficacy of a dual IL‐17A and IL‐17F inhibitor in mild psoriasis. Bimekizumab showed fast onset of clinically‐meaningful efficacy; maximal or near‐maximal magnitude of response was maintained up to Weeks 12–20. Supports continued clinical development of bimekizumab for IL‐17A and IL‐17F‐mediated diseases.

 Introduction 
 Psoriasis is a chronic and debilitating immune‐mediated inflammatory skin disease that affects 1–3% of the worldwide population  4 . Approximately 80% of individuals with psoriasis have mild‐to‐moderate forms of the disease  5 . People with psoriasis typically develop erythematosus and scaly plaques on their skin, and extent of skin surface involvement is a key determinant of disease severity  5 . Beyond physical symptoms, psoriasis imposes a substantial psychosocial burden on individuals and many struggle to cope with the stigma associated with their disease  6 . Moreover, it has been reported that psoriasis can impair quality of life to the same extent as clinically severe conditions such as cancer and diabetes  4 . Psoriasis is also associated with significant comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and depression  7 . Current treatment recommendations are based on psoriasis symptom severity: topical creams (corticosteroids and vitamin D3) for mild‐to‐moderate disease; and systemic or phototherapies for moderate‐to‐severe disease  5 . The aetiology of psoriasis is poorly understood; however, it is known to have an immune‐mediated pathogenesis  8 . Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) plays a role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis  9  and biological treatments include TNF inhibitors (adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab)  10 . Interleukin (IL)‐17 also plays a critical role in psoriasis  8 . Release of IL‐17 triggers a proinflammatory signalling cascade in skin keratinocytes, which is believed to drive chronic inflammation in conditions such as psoriasis  11 . IL‐17 family members share a structural similarity, which is particularly evident in the IL‐17A and IL‐17F isoforms  11 . IL‐17A is pathogenic in mouse models of immune‐inflammatory disease, with IL‐17F considered less important  12 . In humans, IL‐17A and IL‐17F are key proinflammatory cytokines that share similar and overlapping biological functions  13 ,  14 . Both are drivers of chronic inflammation and coexpressed in immune‐inflammatory diseases  14 ,  15 . Although there are limited studies in humans, there is evidence for a role for IL‐17F in the pathogenesis of psoriasis  16 ,  17 . The use of agents targeting the IL‐17 pathway has been evaluated extensively in clinical studies for psoriasis  8  with therapeutic interventions either approved or in clinical development. Notably, secukinumab (IL‐17A inhibitor) is now approved for the treatment of moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis in the USA and EU  18 ,  19 . Ixekizumab (IL‐17A inhibitor) is also approved for the treatment of patients with moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis in the USA and EU  20 ,  21 . Brodalumab (IL‐17RA blocker) is under clinical development for moderate‐to‐severe psoriasis  8 ,  22 ,  23 . Inhibitors of the IL‐17RA receptor, such as brodalumab, exert broad blockade, encompassing inhibition of not only IL‐17A and IL‐17F but also IL‐25 (IL‐17E); IL‐25 has anti‐inflammatory effects in human cells  24 . The currently approved agents have demonstrated clinical efficacy in subjects with moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis  25 ,  26 ,  27 ,  28 , and are considered generally well tolerated  29 . However, IL‐17A and IL‐17F have a critical function in adaptive immune defence from bacterial and fungal infection, and inhibition of this action could potentially leave subjects more vulnerable to infection  30 . In clinical studies involving anti‐IL‐17A or anti‐IL‐17 receptor inhibitors, the most common adverse events (AEs) reported by subjects included: worsening of disease, upper respiratory tract infections, headache, nausea and nasopharyngitis  29 . Neutropenia is also a potential class effect, specifically reported in subjects who have received secukinumab, ixekizumab or brodalumab  26 ,  27 ,  28 . Bimekizumab (formerly UCB4940) is a novel humanized monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin G1 isotype, rationally designed to be able to bind at a similar site on both IL‐17A and IL‐17F, conveying dual inhibition of both isoforms. Comparing this unique mechanism of action with other agents, bimekizumab might improve therapeutic efficacy through its potent selectivity for the IL‐17A and IL‐17F isoforms. Bimekizumab is in early clinical development in several indications, including psoriasis. Here we report the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and effect on clinical features of plaque psoriasis of single‐dose bimekizumab in a first‐in‐human study of subjects with mild psoriasis. 
 Methods 
 Study design This was a Phase I, first‐in‐human, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, single‐dose, dose‐escalating study (NCT02529956). It was conducted in accordance with the applicable regulatory and International Conference on Harmonisation – Good Clinical Practice requirements, the ethical principles originating in the Declaration of Helsinki, and local laws. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the National Research Ethics Service Committee South Central‐Berkshire (Research Ethics Committee reference: 12/SC/0564). All subjects provided documented consent prior to study entry. Treatment administration and data collection were carried out at a single clinical pharmacology site in the UK. Each subject underwent a ≤19‐day screening period, followed by predosing assessments over a 2‐day period, prior to infusion of bimekizumab or placebo. Subjects were randomized to one of six treatment groups to receive: bimekizumab single intravenous infusion dose of 8, 40, 160, 480 or 640 mg, or placebo. A safety follow‐up (SFU) period was also included in the study; subjects were evaluated during a 20‐week period after dosing. Study treatment Dosing Each subject received a single intravenous infusion of bimekizumab (at the dose specified for that cohort), or placebo over a duration of ≥60 min. Subjects were assigned sequentially to cohorts and were randomly assigned to study treatment. The first treatment group received the lowest dose, 8 mg, bimekizumab, or placebo; dose escalations were based on reviews of the safety, PK and laboratory data from the previous cohort. Study population The key inclusion criteria for this study were: male or female (age ≥18 to ≤70 years); subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of mild‐to‐moderate plaque‐type psoriasis for ≥6 months involving ≤5% of body surface area (excluding the scalp); and at least two psoriatic lesions with at least one plaque in suitable biopsy sites. Key exclusion criteria included: use of systemic nonbiological psoriasis therapy (methotrexate, steroids or cyclophosphamide) or psoralen plus UVA/UVB phototherapy within 4 weeks prior to screening; and treatment with biological agents ≤12 months before the study. Objectives The primary objective was to evaluate the safety of single‐dose bimekizumab. Secondary objectives were to characterize the PK profile of single‐dose bimekizumab and to assess its effects on clinical features of plaque psoriasis. An exploratory objective was to assess the immunogenicity of bimekizumab. Study outcome variables Safety Safety variables were assessed during this study, e.g. AEs, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) data, clinical chemistry, haematology (including coagulation/haemostasis tests) and urinalysis. All variables were assessed during the study predose and 0–48‐h postdrug time points, all safety variables except ECG data were assessed during the study screening period. Additionally, AEs were assessed at each time point up to Week 20 of the postinfusion SFU period; vital signs were monitored during Weeks 1–20 of the SFU. Clinical chemistry and haematology parameters were assessed at Weeks 1–4, and Weeks 8, 12 and 20. Urinalysis was measured at Weeks 1, 4, 12 and 20. Pharmacokinetics Bimekizumab concentrations were determined in plasma using a sandwich ligand‐binding assay and visualized using electrochemiluminescence. The assay had a range of quantitation between 150 and 18 000 ng ml –1 . The inter‐ and intraday assay precision, as determined by coefficient of variation, was ≤20%. The impact of interference was not evaluated. Blood samples were taken predose, then at 0–48 h, 72 h and 96 h postdose, and during Weeks 1–20 of the SFU. Immunogenicity Plasma samples were also used to test for the detection of anti‐bimekizumab antibodies at predose, Week 4 and Week 20 of the SFU period. Effects on clinical features of plaque psoriasis Lesion severity score (LSS), Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and hysician's Global Assessment (PGA) of disease severity were investigated. LSS was assessed using five‐point severity scales of lesion redness, induration and scaling (0 = none, 4 = severe), on separate psoriatic lesions to those taken for biopsy. PASI was assessed by the investigator, based on a five‐point scale, as for LSS. PASI scores ranged from 0 to 72 (higher scores indicating more severe disease  31 ). PGA was assessed by the investigator based on their impression of disease severity. A seven‐point scale was used to grade PGA (0 = clear, 6 = severe). These variables were measured during the predose and dosing periods, and during Weeks 1–20 of SFU. Statistical methods This study was designed to have &gt;80% power to detect a 60% improvement in LSS from placebo at Week 2. The power calculations were based on a two‐sided  t  test with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.84, placebo mean score of 6.3, statistical significance level of 5%, and six subjects on bimekizumab and 10 subjects on placebo. Demographic, safety, PK and clinical features of plaque psoriasis were summarized descriptively by treatment group and visit. Descriptive statistics on continuous data included arithmetic means, geometric means (where appropriate), medians, SDs and ranges. Categorical data were summarized using frequency counts and percentages. PK parameters were calculated via noncompartmental analysis methods from the concentration‐time data. Immunogenicity was assessed using the validated method QBR113786 (LGC Limited, UK) to quantify anti‐bimekizumab antibodies, with a screening cut‐off point of 290 ng ml –1 . The LSS at Week 2 was treated as a continuous variable and was analysed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline value (predose) as a covariate and dose as a fixed effect. Estimated means, differences from placebo and 95% confidence intervals were presented by dose. Additionally, a Bayesian analysis of LSS and PASI scores at Week 2 was performed to support internal decision making for bimekizumab and the model was similar to the ANCOVA described above. Vague normal prior distributions were used for these analyses. From the posterior distributions of the model parameters, the posterior mean, 95% credible interval and posterior probability of the treatment effect exceeding certain prespecified thresholds were reported. The results of the Bayesian analyses only are reported in the subsequent section, which were consistent with the ANCOVA results. A decision was made  a‐priori  to not use  P ‐values and so they are not reported here. Statistical confidence in the treatment effect was based on confidence/credible intervals and posterior probabilities. There was no imputation of missing data, nor correction for multiple comparisons. 
 Results 
 Subject disposition is summarized in Figure  1 . Of the 234 subjects screened for study inclusion, 195 (83.3%) failed screening; 39 (comprising the full analysis set [FAS] and PK per‐protocol set) were randomized to treatment (bimekizumab,  n  = 26; placebo,  n  = 13). A total of 37 subjects completed the study; two were withdrawn (one each from the bimekizumab 8 mg group and 480 mg group, neither because of an AE). No subjects received concomitant medication for psoriasis during the study. Figure 1 Subject disposition. iv, intravenous. * Subject 00019 (bimekizumab 8 mg group) and subject 00111 (bimekizumab 480 mg group) withdrew themselves from the study. For both subjects, the reason for discontinuation was listed as withdrawal by subject and was not the result of an adverse event Subject demography and disease characteristics A summary of subject demographics at baseline is shown in Table  1 . The majority of subjects were male (76.9%) and Caucasian (94.9%), and mean age was 39.53 years (range: 21.4–65.0 years). The median PASI score for the study population at baseline was 3.50 (range 0.8–6.7), corresponding to PASI scores for a population with mild psoriasis. The first subject was enrolled on 22nd November 2012; the last subject completed the study protocol on 13th January 2014.

One serious AE of vomiting (moderate intensity), occurring 37 days after dosing, was experienced by a subject receiving 40 mg bimekizumab; this was considered not related to the study medication. No study discontinuations due to TEAEs, severe TEAEs or deaths were reported during this study. No infusion‐site reactions were reported. Mean neutrophil counts were similar between treatment groups (Figure  2 ), and no subject experienced clinically meaningful changes in neutrophil count. Figure 2 Mean neutrophil count by treatment group (full analysis set); LNL, lower normal limit; UNL, upper normal limit. Note: 95% confidence intervals are included for the placebo and bimekizumab highest treatment groups only. The figure was based on protocol‐specified time after administration time points for the x‐axis; however, the time points presented in this figure are offset for each treatment group to avoid overlap of symbols and confidence intervals No notable differences in mean values, or consistent or clinically meaningful changes from baseline, for any laboratory parameters were reported. There were no reports of clinically meaningful ECG changes or physical examination abnormalities during the study. Overall, there were no consistent or clinically meaningful changes from baseline in vital signs observed during the study. PK The PK of bimekizumab increased with dose in a linear fashion (Figure  3 ). Following the end of drug infusion, bimekizumab exhibited a biphasic disposition and a linear elimination across the dose range evaluated.

LOQ, limit of quantitation; Note: the figure was based on protocol‐specified time after administration time points for the x‐axis; however, the time points presented in this figure are offset for each treatment group to avoid overlap of symbols and confidence intervals PK parameters are summarized in Table  3 . Moderate‐to‐high interindividual variability for the area under the curve (AUC; geometric coefficient of variation [%] range: 22.0–64.1%) was observed in the bimekizumab dose groups. Geometric mean (GeoMean) half‐life ranged from 17 days (bimekizumab 40 mg) to 22 days (bimekizumab 160 mg) across the treatment groups. GeoMean volume of distribution in terminal phase ranged from 4.25 l (480 mg group) to 5.82 l (8 mg group). GeoMean of total body clearance ranged from 0.15 l day –1  (480 mg group) to 0.19 l day –1  (8 mg group). GeoMean AUC 0–∞  increased in proportion with increasing doses of bimekizumab (Figure  4 ), as did C max  (data not shown).

Note: at bimekizumab 480 mg, the AUC was reported for five subjects. The AUC was not calculated for one subject because insufficient data points were available in the elimination phase of the pharmacokinetic profile Immunogenicity Anti‐bimekizumab antibodies were detected and confirmed in one subject predose (160 mg treatment group), and five subjects at the SFU visit (Week 20; two subjects in the 8 mg group, two subjects in the 40 mg group, and one subject in the 160 mg group). There was no effect of anti‐bimekizumab antibodies on PK parameters (data not shown). Effects on clinical features of plaque psoriasis After administration, bimekizumab produced dose‐dependent improvements across the evaluated clinical features of plaque psoriasis, LSS, PASI and PGA (Figure  5 ). The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the placebo and bimekizumab 640 mg groups did not overlap at any time point postbaseline for all of these endpoints, indicating a difference between the two treatment groups.

LSS, lesion severity score; PASI, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index; PGA, physician's global assessment. Note: 95% confidence intervals are included for the placebo and bimekizumab highest treatment groups only, to enable clarity of the plots. Note: figure was based on protocol‐specified time after administration time points for the x‐axis; however, the time points presented in this figure are offset for each treatment group to avoid overlap of symbols and confidence intervals LSS A fast onset of response was observed with a mean reduction of &gt;80% from baseline LSS in the top two dose groups at study Week 2. At this time point, in the 40–640 mg treatment groups, it was estimated from the Bayesian analysis that the probability of achieving &gt;0% improvement in LSS over placebo was &gt;99%; in the top two treatment groups, probability of ≥60% improvement versus placebo was &gt;90%. The magnitude of response was reflected by a maximal reduction in mean change from baseline in LSS of &gt;90% in the 160 mg group. This was achieved by Week 8 and was maintained to Week 16. In the 480 mg group a maximal magnitude of response, 100%, was achieved as early as Week 4. The response was also maintained to Week 16. In the 640 mg group, the maximal reduction (100%) was achieved by Week 8 and was maintained between Weeks 12 and 20 (Figure  5 A). In addition to the 640 mg dose group, no overlap in CIs between the other bimekizumab treatment groups (40–480 mg) at Week 2  vs.  placebo was observed, indicating a difference between the two groups. Similar results were obtained for the area under the effect curve (Weeks 0–4, [AUEC 0‐4w ]) variable (data not shown). PASI score A fast onset of response was observed with a mean reduction of &gt;65% from baseline PASI scores in the top two treatment groups at Week 2. Bayesian analysis revealed that the posterior probability of ≥60% improvement over placebo at this time point was &gt;80%. For the bimekizumab 160 mg treatment group, the magnitude of response was reflected by a maximal reduction in the mean change from baseline in PASI score of &gt;85% achieved by Week 6. This response was maintained to study Week 12. In the 480 mg and 640 mg treatment groups, a maximal magnitude of response of ≥94% was observed. This was achieved by Week 6 in the 480 mg group and Week 4 in the 640 mg group. In both groups the response was maintained to Week 12 (Figure  5 B). Additionally, for bimekizumab 40–640 mg treatment groups at Week 2, the posterior probability of a &gt;0% improvement in PASI score over placebo was &gt;99%. PGA A mean reduction of &gt;50% from baseline in PGA was observed at the highest doses of bimekizumab (480 mg and 640 mg) assessed. Maximal reductions in mean change from baseline in PGA scores of &gt;75% were observed in the bimekizumab 160 mg group. This reduction was achieved by Week 6 and was maintained to Week 12. Maximal reductions in mean change from baseline in PGA scores were 100% and 94%, respectively for bimekizumab 480 mg and 640 mg treatment groups (Figure  5 C). These reductions were achieved by Week 8 and were maintained to Week 12 in the 480 mg group, and achieved by Week 4 and maintained to Week 12 in the 640 mg group.

 This is the first time that safety, tolerability and clinical efficacy of a dual IL‐17A and IL‐17F inhibitor have been demonstrated in subjects with mild psoriasis. Bimekizumab, administered by intravenous infusion in a single ascending dose, was tolerated across the dose range assessed (≤640 mg); no safety concerns were identified in this study. The most frequently reported TEAE was headache and only one serious AE (vomiting of moderate intensity) was reported, but it was not considered related to the study treatment. Furthermore, no subject experienced clinically meaningful changes in neutrophil count and no infusion‐site reactions occurred during the study. Importantly, the specific dual inhibition of IL‐17A and IL‐17F by bimekizumab is achieved without interacting with the IL‐17RA receptor, which also binds IL‐25. As such, by sparing IL‐25 in tissues, bimekizumab may reduce the potential for proinflammatory consequences that could result from interfering with the IL‐25 signalling pathway. Bimekizumab demonstrated linear and dose‐proportional PK and a typical half‐life ranging from 17–26 days. The moderate‐to‐high interindividual variability for AUC in the bimekizumab treatment groups is likely to be due to the small number of subjects in the study. Estimated values for volume of distribution in terminal phase were similar to predicted total blood volume distribution, suggesting that distribution of bimekizumab was restricted to the extravascular compartment with limited distribution to peripheral tissues, as expected for a biological agent. The presence of anti‐bimekizumab antibodies in six subjects with mild psoriasis did not have a negative impact on PK or clinical outcomes. The single‐dose nature of this study should be considered when discussing development of anti‐bimekizumab antibodies and any potential effect on clinical outcomes; this topic may be further explored in multiple‐dose studies. All indicators of disease activity measured at baseline were consistent with those expected in subjects with mild psoriasis. Bimekizumab‐treated subjects achieved a fast onset response, observed from study Week 2. Responses reached a maximal magnitude (75–100% reduction in disease activity scores) as early as Week 4. Responses were also maintained up to Weeks 12–20 for 160–640 mg groups, in all measures of disease activity compared with the placebo group, as demonstrated by reductions in LSS, PASI scores and PGA. Observed clinical efficacy appeared to increase with increasing doses of bimekizumab. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that inhibition of both IL‐17A and IL‐17F will lead to significant clinical outcomes in moderate to severe psoriasis and requires larger clinical studies in moderate to severe psoriasis patients to confirm this hypothesis and to explore further dosage regimes. 
 Conclusion 
 This is the first demonstration of safety, tolerability and clinical efficacy using a dual inhibitor of IL‐17A and IL‐17F in subjects with mild psoriasis. Subjects receiving bimekizumab achieved fast onset of clinically‐meaningful efficacy from Week 2. A maximal magnitude of response was observed as early as Week 4 that was maintained up to Weeks 12–20, in all clinical features of plaque psoriasis. These findings support the continued clinical development of bimekizumab for diseases mediated by both IL‐17A and IL‐17F, including psoriasis.

    <Body>What is already known about this subject 
 Most pregnant women use the Internet to search for information on pharmacological treatment. Online pregnancy‐related information is available through many sources, each with different levels of credibility. A complete overview of the quality and quantity of social media information available to pregnant women is lacking. 
 What this study adds 
 There is an abundance of social media posts related to the medication safety during pregnancy. Over 40% of posts were not in line with the current knowledge about the medications' risk. This inaccuracy of online information may affect women's perception and decisions regarding medication use during pregnancy. 
 1 INTRODUCTION Medication use during pregnancy is very common, with &gt;80% of Dutch pregnant women using one or more prescription or over‐the‐counter (OTC) medications. 1  Pregnant women use a wide variety of medications for pregnancy‐related conditions (e.g. nausea and vomiting, gastric reflux, hypertensive disorders) and for conditions unrelated to pregnancy (e.g. asthma, migraine, hay fever), some of which cannot be discontinued. Pharmacotherapy during pregnancy involves a benefit–risk assessment, in which there is a trade‐off between the potential benefits for the mother and possible risks for the foetus. Although there is insufficient data on the safety during pregnancy for many commonly used medications, 2 ,  3 ,  4  drug labelling, including the guidelines from the European Medicines Agency and US Food and Drug Administration, 5 ,  6  may assist clinicians and pregnant women in making decisions regarding pharmacotherapy. The Internet has become an important source of health information to supplement information provided by health care providers. 7  This is also applicable to pregnant women, who increasingly search the Internet for pregnancy‐related information for topics such as foetal development, nutrition and medications in pregnancy, pregnancy complications, and prenatal care. 8  More specifically, most pregnant women use the Internet to search for information on a treatment prescribed and over 80% of the women used information from the Internet to influence their decisions about medication use in pregnancy. 9 ,  10 
 In a multinational cross‐sectional study from 2010, as many as 83% of pregnant and postpartum women considered the quality of online information they retrieved to be  good  or  excellent . 9  Pregnancy‐related information is available on the Internet through many sources, each with a different level of credibility. In addition to information on websites managed by health services or governmental organisations, use of social media sites to search for medication safety information during pregnancy was reported in a 2013 online survey by 85% of a UK sample of women who were pregnant or delivered in the last year. 10  As social media is defined as a collection of websites and applications that enable users to create and share content or to participate in social networking, 11  content is mainly generated by lay people. Consequently, the quality of these unstructured real‐world data is generally not clear for the public. Using social media as a data source for pharmacoepidemiological research or pharmacovigilance is challenging due to technical, regulatory and ethical issues. 12 ,  13  In a 2014 study, a limited number of chats on French forums was analysed to assess the quality and reliability of information on medication use in pregnancy shared by Internet users. 14  Likewise, Hansen et al. reported on YouTube videos as a source of information on medication use during pregnancy in 2016. 15  As both previous studies selected only one source of online information, these do not provide a complete overview of the quality and quantity of social media information available to pregnant women. In the current study, we systematically assessed the availability and accuracy of all social media content in the Dutch language on the safety of medication use during pregnancy using a social media monitoring tool as a novel method of data collection. 2 METHODS 2.1 Search strategy We performed a systematic search of posts published on social media, which included Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, Pinterest, blogs, forums and reviews, between 1 May 2011 and 30 April 2016 related to the safety of medication use during pregnancy using the social media monitoring tool Coosto. 16  This tool enables systematic searches of online content, in different sources and time frames. Furthermore, it keeps an archive of all Dutch posts published on social media and thereby provides the opportunity to extract all posts on a certain topic. Coosto has been used for similar purposes in scientific research before. 17 ,  18  As we used open access Internet sources in which we considered the research as textual representation instead of human subject research, 19  no ethical approval was required. All information included in Coosto datasets is publicly available and does not contain identifiable data besides a nickname and information voluntarily shared by the online contributors. The search strategy consisted of the following elements: (i) a pregnancy‐related term; (ii) commonly used medications during pregnancy; and (iii) a maternal complication related to pregnancy or an adverse outcome for the child, including general statements of safety. The list of commonly used medications ( n  = 127, Appendix  A ), which included both prescription and OTC medications, was compiled using recent data from the PRegnancy and Infant DEvelopment (PRIDE) Study. 20  We used both the generic and the brand name of the medications. The complications and adverse outcomes included miscarriage, gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia, haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet (HELLP) syndrome, stillbirth, preterm birth, low birth weight, birth defects, small‐for‐gestational age, large‐for‐gestational age, and macrosomia. The complete search strategy is available in Appendix  B . All search terms were entered as free text, because Coosto does not contain keywords or subject headings comparable to the common bibliographic databases. 2.2 Inclusion and exclusion criteria We included posts published in the Dutch language describing a potential association between the use of a specific medication during pregnancy and maternal complications or adverse outcomes for the child, as well as posts implying overall safety or risks of the use of medication during pregnancy. All posts from the web site  https://www.apotheek.nl  were excluded, because these were only described in interactions with other medications, providing no information on the safety or potential risks of the medications selected. Furthermore, duplicate posts were excluded, as well as posts without text. A random sample of 101 posts was independently assessed for eligibility by 3 reviewers (M.v.G., A.R. and T.v.d.B.), which showed good to excellent agreement between the pairs of reviewers (kappa statistics ranging between 0.79 and 0.83). Therefore, the remaining posts were assessed by a single reviewer. In case of doubt about eligibility, the post was discussed with the other reviewers to accomplish a joint decision. 2.3 Data abstraction From each post, we extracted the date of publication, URL, text, source, medication mentioned, pregnancy complication or other adverse outcome for the child mentioned, and the perception of safety implied in the post. The latter was classified into 4 mutually exclusive categories: (i) safe; (ii) use on strict indication or second‐line drug; (iii) insufficient knowledge on the safety during pregnancy available; or (iv) unsafe or contraindicated. Posts with an unclear perception (e.g. stating that a medication was safe in one part of the post, but also stating unsafe in another part) were discussed among the reviewers to determine the conclusion on the perception of safety implied. For all medications mentioned in the posts included, we retrieved the safety information as communicated by the Teratology Information Service (TIS) of the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb. 21  This safety information is grouped into 6 categories; to match the safety classification of the social media posts we combined the categories  pharmacologic effect, monitor use  and  teratogenic, monitor use  into  use on strict indication  or  second‐line drug  and the categories  pharmacologic effect, contraindicated  and  teratogenic, contraindicated  into  unsafe  or  contraindicated . If a medication was listed in multiple categories depending on dose or indication for use, we selected the safety application that is most applicable to pregnant women (i.e. OTC medication, most commonly occurring indication). 2.4 Statistical analysis We used descriptive statistics to characterize the information abstracted from the social media posts. To evaluate the accuracy of the social media content, we compared the perception of safety from the posts with the TIS classification as reference standard. Furthermore, we assessed whether the calendar year of publication, source of publication, type of medication (OTC  vs  prescription) and TIS classification were associated with accuracy by determining the risk difference in incorrect perception with its 95% confidence interval (CI). Analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics version 25 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). 3 RESULTS The search yielded 9227 posts published between May 2011 and April 2016, of which 1224 posts related to the safety of medication use were included in this study. Posts were excluded because they were empty ( n  = 92), duplicates ( n  = 933), did not describe the association between medication use and outcomes (e.g. focused on pharmacological treatment for the outcome or mentioned medication use and pregnancy without any connection;  n  = 6780), only included unselected medications or outcomes ( n  = 100) or groups of medication ( n  = 53), or were inconclusive about the association (e.g. asked a question about safety;  n  = 45). The majority of posts included originated from forums (78%), followed by blogs (12%) and Facebook (7%). The posts described 1441 scenarios on medication safety in pregnancy. These scenarios concerned 111 medications and 30 outcomes; the most frequently mentioned medications and outcomes are listed in Tables  1  and  2 , respectively. According to the TIS classification, 57 of these medications (51%) are considered safe during pregnancy, 4 medications (4%) are contraindicated, 21 medications (19%) may only be used on strict indication and, for 29 medications (26%), insufficient knowledge on the safety during pregnancy is available.

 11 Preterm birth 10 In Table  3 , the agreement between safety as perceived in the online posts and safety information as communicated by the TIS is shown. A total of 820 (57%) scenarios described in the posts were in line with the TIS classification. The level of agreement was highest for contraindicated medication (80%), followed by medications considered safe during pregnancy (76%), medications with insufficient knowledge (24%), and medications on strict indication or second‐line drugs (7%). More specifically, risks of adverse outcomes were overestimated in 24% of posts on medications considered safe, 44% of posts on medications on strict indication or second‐line drugs, and 32% of posts on medications with insufficient knowledge. Underestimation of risks was most common for medications on strict indication or second‐line drugs (49%), followed by medications with insufficient knowledge (44%) and contraindicated medication (20%). For the individual medications considered safe during pregnancy with at least 10 posts, the percentage of correct online perceptions ranged between 20% (codeine and metronidazole) and 100% (beclomethasone for asthma, lactulose and methyldopa). These percentages ranged between 54% (acetylsalicylic acid) and 91% (ibuprofen) for contraindicated medication, 0% (fluoxetine, paroxetine, progesterone, and venlafaxine) and 33% (morphine) for medication on strict indication of second‐line drugs, and 13% (ondansetron) and 39% (metformin) for medications with insufficient knowledge. In Table  4 , examples of correctly and incorrectly perceived risks by TIS classification are shown.

The year of publication of the online post and the source of publication were not associated with incorrect perception of the safety of medication use during pregnancy, although posts on Twitter seemed somewhat more likely to be incorrectly perceived compared to forum posts (59%  vs  42%; risk difference 17.7, 95% CI 0.0–35.1; Table  5 ). The safety of medications that are available on prescription only was more often incorrectly perceived than the safety of medications that are available OTC (60%  vs  25%; risk difference 35.5, 95% CI 30.7–40.3). Furthermore, medications with the TIS classification on strict indication or second‐line drugs (93%, risk difference 69.8, 95% CI 65.7–73.9) and medications with insufficient knowledge (76%; risk difference 52.1, 95% CI 44.9–59.4) were far more likely to receive an incorrect perception of safety compared with medications that are considered safe according to the TIS classification (24%).

TIS, Teratology Information Service. 4 DISCUSSION In this study, we reviewed over 9000 social media posts and abstracted information from 1224 posts on forums, blogs, Facebook, Twitter and other social media sources on the safety of medication use during pregnancy. We compared the perceived safety as reported in the posts on 1441 scenarios between selected medication use during pregnancy and safety outcomes with the information from the TIS of the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb, suggesting that over 40% of posts were not in line with the current knowledge about the medications' risk. This was particularly the case for prescription medication and medications with a TIS classification on strict indication or second‐line drugs, and medications with insufficient knowledge on their safety during pregnancy. This is the first study to systematically review a large number of posts published publicly on multiple social media platforms related to the safety of medication use during pregnancy. Two previous studies focussed on a single social media source only: chats on French forums 14  and English YouTube videos. 15  Similar to those studies, we observed low concordance between the perceived online safety and official ratings. Concordance was lowest for the TIS categories with more subtle interpretations (i.e. on strict indication or second‐line and insufficient knowledge), which may resemble the binary treatment decision pregnant women have to make: should I take this medication? Indeed, most medications within these TIS categories were perceived as either safe or contraindicated based on the social media posts. This may particularly be a problem for the commonly used antidepressants, for which an individual‐based benefit–risk assessment of pharmacological treatment is vital. To complicate this assessment of medication safety using online sources, articles in which harm was associated with antidepressant use during pregnancy receive more tweets than articles with reassuring results, 22  biasing public opinion towards potential risks. However, for the medications in the more definitive TIS classifications safe and contraindicated, concordance was also suboptimal (approximately 80%). This may have profound impact on clinical practice. For medications that are considered safe during pregnancy, perceived risks associated with use may result in non‐adherence, which for some medications, including salbutamol, lamotrigine and different types of antibiotics, may impair maternal and/or infant health. Several studies on women's beliefs and risk perception on medication use in pregnancy confirm that pregnant women tend to overestimate the potential risks and subsequently chose to avoid the use of certain medications. 23 ,  24 ,  25 ,  26  By contrast, when contraindicated medication is perceived as safe, pregnant women may decide to take this medication, putting their unborn infants at risk of adverse outcomes. A recent qualitative study stresses that women lack knowledge about the effects of their medication use on the unborn child and that they use, among others, online sources such as blogs and social media to make decisions about medication use during pregnancy. 27  In light of the inaccuracy of information in online posts, health practitioners involved in care for pregnant women should be aware of this need for information and provide pregnant women with reliable resources to make an evidence‐based decision regarding pharmacological treatment. However, we do not have data available on the number of times correct and incorrect posts are actually being read by pregnant women. This information, which may be collected using other study designs and methods of data collection, could shed more light on the actual consequences of inaccurate information in online posts. The medications most often mentioned in relation to safety of use during pregnancy include relatively many medications that are available OTC, such as paracetamol, ibuprofen and omeprazole. This seems to largely agree with the medications most often used during pregnancy in Europe and North America. 3 ,  28 ,  29 ,  30 ,  31  Although valid prevalence estimates of OTC medication use during pregnancy in the Netherlands are not available, ibuprofen use during pregnancy, which is contraindicated, seems far less common in the Netherlands compared to the USA (&lt;2  vs  &gt;15%, respectively), 20 ,  32  whereas this medication was often mentioned in the Dutch online posts. Therefore, mentions in online posts do not imply actual medication use and these results cannot be extrapolated to indicate which medications are most often used during pregnancy in the Netherlands. In addition to the ability to review posts on multiple social media platforms, other strengths of this study include the predefined selection of prescription and OTC medications based on real‐world data and the inclusion of a wide variety of maternal complications and adverse pregnancy outcomes. The latter gives a broader overview of medication safety during pregnancy than the frequent focus on birth defects as the outcome of interest only. However, our study also has some limitations. First, we included online posts in the Dutch language only. Petersen et al. showed that there may be substantial individual and geographical variations in risk perception regarding medication, 25  so our results may not be generalizable to other countries. Second, we may have missed posts due to typos in medication names and pregnancy complications or outcomes, which might be more likely to contain incorrectly perceived safety information. In future studies, including commonly made typos could be included to further improve identification of relevant posts. Additionally, although Coosto claims to find every post that fulfils the search criteria, 16  currently no reference standard is available to confirm its validity and reliability. However, there is no reason to assume that posts with an incorrect perception of risk are more likely to be detected than posts with a correct perception and vice versa, limiting the probability of bias in the accuracy analyses. Third, the posts were hand‐coded by a single reviewer as it was too time‐consuming to code all posts in duplicate. Although agreement between reviewers was good to excellent in a random sample of posts, this may have led to inaccuracies in the selection and abstraction of data. Natural language processing may overcome this problem as it is capable of generating structured information from unstructured free text, 33  but no algorithms for this task are currently available in the Dutch language. Finally, the identity of the authors of the online posts is unknown, but based on the context of the posts, we may assume that the results reflect the actual knowledge of pregnant women themselves. In conclusion, there is an abundance of Dutch social media posts on the safety of medication use during pregnancy, but a large proportion of these posts provides inaccurate information. As this information may influence individual treatment decisions during pregnancy, recognition and adequate communication between pregnant women and healthcare providers may assist women in making evidence‐based decisions regarding pharmacotherapy during pregnancy.

    <Abstact>SARS‐CoV‐2 is the novel coronavirus behind the COVID‐19 pandemic. Since its emergence, the global scientific community has mobilized to study this virus, and an overwhelming effort to identify COVID‐19 treatments is currently ongoing for a variety of therapeutics and prophylactics. In order to better understand these efforts, we compiled a list of all COVID‐19 vaccines undergoing pre‐clinical and clinical testing using the WHO and ClinicalTrials.gov database, with details surrounding trial design and location.

    <Body>What is Already Known about this Subject 
 The potency of topical corticosteroids is determined by the human vasoconstrictor assay, which is a surrogate method for anti‐inflammatory effect. Human methods for testing the anti‐inflammatory potency of topical corticosteroids are reported; however, there is no standardized quantitative human test method for simultaneous testing of both corticosteroids and nonsteroidal drugs. 
 What this Study Adds 
 These studies provide a standardized method for testing and comparing the anti‐inflammatory potencies of topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors in human volunteers. 
 Introduction Corticosteroids are the major topical anti‐inflammatory drugs used in the treatment of a wide range of inflammatory skin diseases. There is a need for new therapies and for reliable human testing methods that allow the anti‐inflammatory potencies of topical corticosteroids to be compared, as well to compare topical non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs with topical corticosteroids. Traditionally, the potency of topical corticosteroids has been determined using the human vasoconstrictor assay in which cutaneous pallor is evaluated after occluded application of agents on healthy skin  1 . This classical assay has inherent limitations as follows: (i) the vasoconstrictor assay methodology relies primarily on the subjective nature of clinical inspection to estimate the blanching effect; (ii) it uses the degree of skin blanching as an indicator of drug potency and, as such, only functions as a surrogate assessment of the anti‐inflammatory effect; and (iii) it is not possible to compare the effect of topical corticosteroids with nonsteroidal therapies such as topical calcineurin inhibitors, which have no vasoconstrictor activity  2 ,  3 . At present, tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are only approved for the treatment of atopic dermatitis; however, there is evidence to support their efficacy in the treatment of other types of eczema including seborrheic dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis  4 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7 ,  8 . Several studies have compared the therapeutic potency of topical corticosteroids by assessing their effects on allergic reactions elicited by environmental allergens such as nickel or poison ivy in spontaneously sensitized patients  2 ,  9 ,  10 ,  11 ,  12 ,  13 , while use of a standardized immunological challenge with an experimental sensitizer, dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB), in healthy volunteers has only been reported once as a tool to quantify the potency of anti‐inflammatory agents  3 . To develop a human testing method to quantify the relative potencies of topical anti‐inflammatory drugs, we chose diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP) as the experimental allergen. We recently showed that following sensitization of healthy volunteers with DPCP, reactivity to repeated challenges with DPCP initially became progressively stronger, but following the second epicutaneous challenge, the responses become stable and reproducible as assessed by both visual scoring and as measured by skin fold thickness  14 . This clinical finding was supported by histopathology and immunohistochemistry staining together with microarray gene expression profiling using skin biopsies taken from DPCP‐challenged sites  15 . We aimed to develop a human testing method for a T‐cell mediated inflammatory process in the form of a quantified and standardized allergic contact hypersensitivity response, to evaluate the relative potencies of a variety of topical anti‐inflammatory drugs. We designed the study so that the inflammatory challenge used for testing anti‐inflammatory effects was not too aggressive and therefore had the best chance of revealing weaker drug effects. This was achieved by pretesting volunteers to determine the ability of the DPCP challenge concentrations to elicit measurable inflammatory responses. We also wanted to compare the sensitivity of the test system to detect potency differences when the agents were applied before or after the DPCP challenge, or were applied both before and after the challenge. We performed two randomized, double blind, vehicle‐controlled studies in which tacrolimus, pimecrolimus and four topical corticosteroids of different strengths/ potencies  were compared in randomized block designs. Methods Volunteers Healthy volunteers were recruited by advertising on internal notice boards. Twenty‐nine volunteers participated (13 women and 16 men, aged 20–43 years, median 25 years) in study I, and 47 volunteers (16 women and 31 men, aged 20–44 years, median 26 years) in study II. Participants comprised two different groups; pre‐sensitized volunteers ( n  = 5) from a previous DPCP study  14 ,  15  and first‐time volunteers (Study I:  n  = 24; Study II:  n  = 23). Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Exclusion criteria included the following: (i) active skin disease; (ii) a history of atopic dermatitis; (iii) endocrine or immune system disorders; (iv) pregnancy or breastfeeding; and (v) active or prior (i.e. 30 days before study inclusion) treatment with UV radiation, systemic/topical corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents that might influence the treatment response. The studies were approved by the Regional Scientific Ethical Committees for Southern Denmark (Study‐ID: S‐20140149 and S‐20130074) and conducted in accordance with the Helsinki declaration. Induction of DPCP contact allergy Induction of allergic sensitivity was performed using a single DPCP dose of 30 μg cm –2  (22.8 μl of 0.125% DPCP in acetone) applied to a filter‐paper‐lined, 12‐mm Finn chamber (SmartPractice, Phoenix, AZ, USA). The patch test chamber was attached to the skin on the upper buttock then left in place for 48 h  16 . Presensitized volunteers ( n  = 5) from a previous DPCP study  14 ,  15  and all participants in studies I and II were sensitized using the same sensitization protocol. All DPCP (CAS no. 886–38‐4; Alfa Aesar, Karlsruhe, Germany) solutions used in the study were provided by Central Pharmacy, Odense University Hospital. The initial elicitation challenge The initial elicitation challenge was carried out four weeks after the induction phase. Volunteers received a DPCP dose series consisting of seven doses (dose per unit areas) that were increased in 60% increments: 0.484, 0.774, 1.24, 1.98, 3.17, 5.1 and 8.12 μg cm –2 . The DPCP doses were applied to filter‐paper‐lined 8‐mm Finn chambers as 10 μl of the appropriate concentration in acetone to give the required dose‐range. A (negative) control of acetone only was also applied in a separate patch test chamber. The patch test chambers were loaded immediately before their attachment to the upper back. The elicitation patches were removed after 6 h and the patch test sites were marked with a skin marker. At 24 and 48 h, the elicitation responses were assessed visually and by skin ultrasound. In study I, two consecutive DPCP doses were selected for each volunteer at the final (48‐h) reading. This was done to: (i) ensure that a clinically detectable and quantifiable degree of DPCP reactivity was elicited in the subsequent topical treatment phase; and (ii) examine the inhibitory effects of topical treatments on patch test reactions of different inflammatory levels elicited by lower versus higher DPCP doses. Based on the findings from study I, we selected a single DPCP dose in study II for each volunteer that elicited a patch test reaction, corresponding to a doubtful/weak positive reaction or higher, at the final (48‐h) visual reading. Study designs Both studies were conducted as randomized, double‐blind, vehicle‐controlled trials comprising four phases as follows: (i) induction of DPCP contact allergy in first‐time volunteers; (ii) initial elicitation challenge with a DPCP dose series to determine the desired dose (i.e. a mild to moderate positive reaction) to be used in the drug treatment phase; (iii) topical drug treatment of DPCP‐induced allergic patch test reactions; and (iv) visual scoring and skin ultrasound measurement of test sites at 48 and 72 h. The placement of test drugs was rotated (randomized) between volunteers. In study I, 3 topical corticosteroid ointments were evaluated in comparison with a negative control [i.e. an occluded (empty) patch test chamber] and vehicle ointment on both sides of the upper back in each individual. A randomized complete block design was applied for this study. In study II, the anti‐inflammatory effect of six topical agents was evaluated using a similar patch test method, and in comparison with an untreated (positive) DPCP control, negative control, and vehicle ointment and cream. The number of DPCP patches on each volunteer was limited to six on each side of the upper back; therefore, due to the increased number of tested agents, a balanced incomplete block design was applied for this study. Visual scoring An extended version of the International Contact Dermatitis Research Group scoring scale was used (Table  1 )  17 . The responses were graded as negative (–), doubtful (?+), weak positive (1+), definite positive (2+), strong positive (3+) or extremely strong positive (4+).

The ultrasound image contains a specific curve (a  super A‐scan) , which describes the total intensity of the scanned skin area as a function of the depth into the skin. The full ultrasound image is composed of the accumulated average of 188 A‐scans. The average thickness of the dermis was calculated based on the super A‐scan. Dermal inflammation was determined by recording two dermal thickness scans at each test site at both 48 h and 72 h after treatment (Figure  1 ). The means of the two dermal thickness measurements were used in the data analysis. For all recordings, the same operating conditions were used for all volunteers. Figure 1 Automated skin ultrasound measurements of dermal thickness in allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) and control reactions. The  red left  part of the ultrasound curve shows the intensity of the ultrasound passing through the water chamber in the probe. The high left peak originates from the combined film/epidermal reflection. The  red right  part of the curve shows the intensity of the ultrasound passing through the subcutaneous layers. The  yellow  part of the curve indicates the less reflective part of the dermis, while the  green  part indicates the more reflective part of the dermis. The average thickness of the dermis is calculated based on the super A‐scan. The dermal thickness measurements (in μm) are shown next to the ultrasound images (i.e. C and D) and represent the  yellow  and  green  part of the curves.

Data from a participant in Study I are shown Treatment of DPCP‐induced allergic contact dermatitis with test drugs Study I assessed the effects of the topical anti‐inflammatory drugs applied after removal of the DPCP challenge (post‐treatment) because this mimics normal use in clinical practice. Volunteers were rechallenged 5 days after the initial elicitation challenge on either side of the upper back with the two consecutive DPCP doses that had elicited mild to moderate reactions in the first challenge. These two doses were applied in two separate panels, each containing four patches and a vehicle (acetone) control patch. The DPCP doses were applied to filter‐paper‐lined, 8‐mm Finn chambers and were attached to the skin for 6 h. After removal, elicitation sites were marked with a skin marker. Large (12‐mm) Finn chambers were then loaded with approximately 45 mg (corresponding to a dose per area of ≈ 40 mg cm –2 ) ointment and placed as a treatment to three of the highlighted elicitation/challenge sites, while the fourth DPCP elicitation area was treated with a vehicle (white soft paraffin) patch. The vehicle (acetone) control area was occluded with an empty patch test chamber (i.e. negative control). All treatment patches were removed after 48 h. The response at each test site was assessed visually and measured with skin ultrasound immediately and after a further 24 h. In study II, the anti‐inflammatory effects of six topical drugs (four corticosteroid ointments, tacrolimus 0.1% ointment, pimecrolimus 1% cream, and vehicle ointment and cream) were compared following pre‐treatment alone and following combined pre‐ and post‐treatment. The combined pre‐ and post‐treatment was used in order to maximize the possible effect. The same patch test technique was used as described for study I. Two panels were applied on each side of the upper back (i.e. a left and right panel), each with six test sites. According to the incomplete block design, the test sites on each volunteer were pretreated for 24 h with four of the topical products applied in duplicate in 12‐mm Finn chambers. In addition, four empty Finn chambers were applied. All chambers were removed after 24 h and the test sites were marked. Subsequently, the selected DPCP dose was applied in filter‐paper‐lined, 8‐mm Finn chambers and placed for 6 h on the eight pretreated sites and on two untreated sites. The two remaining sites were occluded with empty Finn chambers. After removal of the DPCP patches, the right panel test sites were post‐treated for 48 h with the same agents as had been used for the pre‐exposure treatment. The response at each test site was assessed visually and measured with skin ultrasound immediately and after a further 24 h. For volunteers who had participated in study I, the challenges were performed on previously nonchallenged sites to avoid increased reactivity at previous DPCP‐challenged sites  18 . A flow chart and schematic diagrams illustrating the study designs are shown in Figure  2 . Figure 2 Protocols for sensitization, challenges and topical drug treatment. (A)  Flow chart (study I):  Volunteers were sensitized on the upper buttock for 48 h. Four weeks later, an initial elicitation challenge (IEC) was performed with a diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP) dose‐series. After IEC, volunteers were rechallenged with two DPCP doses applied in two separate panels on the upper back followed by post‐treatment with topical drugs. (B)  Flow chart (study II):  The same setup was used as in study I except that after IEC, test sites were pretreated with four topical products on either side of the upper back (left and right panel). This was followed by rechallenge with a select DPCP dose and finally post‐treatment with topical drugs. (C)  Schematic setup of rechallenge and post‐treatment with topical drugs (study I) : The two panels each consisted of four small (8‐mm) DPCP patches (shown as vertical hatchings) and a vehicle (acetone) control patch (cross‐hatching). Upon removal of these chambers, three large (12‐mm) chambers loaded with topical drugs (dotted rings), a large vehicle ointment chamber (solid ring), and a large empty (negative control) chamber (dashed ring) were placed on the elicitation areas. (D)  Schematic setup of pre‐treatment, rechallenge, and combined pre‐ and post‐treatment with topical drugs (study II) : The two pre‐treatment panels each consisted of six test sites comprising four large Finn chambers filled with topical drugs (dotted rings) and two empty chambers (dashed rings). Small (8‐mm) DPCP chambers (vertical hatchings) were placed on the eight pretreated sites and on two untreated sites. The two remaining sites were occluded with empty Finn chambers (cross‐hatchings). The right panel was post‐treated with the same drugs as used for pre‐treatment, again using large Finn chambers (dotted rings) Sample size The sample size estimation was performed using the statistical software, SAS (software package: Proc Power, version 9.2, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Sample size estimation was performed using a two‐tailed paired  t  test and a level of significance of 0.05. Skin ultrasound was used as the primary measurement variable. In study I, a randomized complete block design was chosen, and a sample size of 24 volunteers was required to achieve 90% power and enabling detection of a 0.3‐mm mean treatment difference based on a standard deviation of 0.3 mm. In study II, because of the larger number of test drugs included and to limit the number of DPCP patches on each volunteer, a balanced incomplete block design was chosen  19 . The parameters of the balanced incomplete block design were:  t  (total number of treatments) = 8,  b  (number of blocks) = 14,  k  (block size) = 4, and  r  (number of repetitions) = 3. The design contained 4 × 14 = 56 subexperiments and had a relative efficacy (variance of pairwise comparison) of 0.86 corresponding to a complete block design with 56/0.86 = 65 subexperiments. To achieve the desired power equal to 24 × 8 = 192 subexperiments, the balanced incomplete block design had to be repeated (192/65) three times. Hence, the total number of participants required for this study was 3 × 14 = 42. Data and statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed with the statistical software package GraphPad Instat (version 3.00, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Experiments and data collection were done by operators blinded to the treatment identity. The blinding of treatments was broken after completion of all tests. Visual scores were transformed to numerical values, and non‐parametric tests were applied for statistical analysis. In study I, the visual scores were analysed globally using a Friedman test, whereas a Kruskal–Wallis test was applied in study II. In the case of global significance,  posthoc  multiple comparison tests (Dunn's post‐test in study I and Dunnett's post‐test in study II) were further applied to examine values between reference points [vehicle ointment in study I and untreated (positive) DPCP control in study II] and each topical drug. In study I, the skin thickness values of test areas treated with drugs measured at 48 h and 72 h, respectively, were expressed as percentages of the vehicle ointment value (reference point). Vehicle values were arbitrarily set at 100%. In study II, untreated (positive) DPCP control was used as the reference point instead of vehicle ointment due to the incomplete block design. Skin thickness data were expressed as a percentage of the absolute values at each time‐point in order to allow for accurate statistical analysis. One‐way analysis of variance with  posthoc  test (Dunnett's post‐test), adjusted for multiple comparisons, was applied for the ultrasound data. The level of significance was set to  P  &lt; 0.05. The data and statistical analysis comply with the recommendations on experimental design and analysis in pharmacology  20 . Materials (topical anti‐inflammatory agents) The topical agents were: clobetasol propionate 0.5 mg g –1  ointment (Dermovate; GlaxoSmithKline Pharma, Brøndby, Denmark), betamethasone‐17‐valerate 1 mg g –1  ointment (Betnovate; GlaxoSmithKline Pharma, Brøndby, Denmark), hydrocortisone‐17‐butyrate 1 mg g –1  ointment (Locoid; Astellas Pharma, Kastrup, Denmark), hydrocortisone 10 mg g –1  ointment (Hydrocortisone  DnE ; Den Norske Eterfabrikk, Oslo, Norway), tacrolimus 1 mg g –1  ointment (Protopic; Astellas Pharma, Kastrup, Denmark) and pimecrolimus 10 mg g –1  cream (Elidel; Meda, Allerød, Denmark). Vehicle ointment [Apotekets Vaseline (Ph. Eur.); Apotekernes Amba, Skovlunde, Denmark] and cream (Helo creme; Faaborg Pharma, Faaborg, Denmark) were included. The volunteers and investigators were blinded to all topical agents and vehicles. The Central Pharmacy, Odense University Hospital, conducted the blinding and coding. Results Response to initial DPCP elicitation challenge In study I, positive contact hypersensitivity to DPCP was induced in 20 of 24 first‐time volunteers (sensitization rate: ≈ 83%) based on the positive patch test responses at the initial elicitation challenge. Of the five presensitized volunteers, four responded to the dose series at the initial elicitation challenge; thus, 24 volunteers were included in the study. In study II, sensitization to DPCP was obtained in 21 of 23 first‐time participants (sensitization rate: ≈ 91%). All presensitized volunteers from study I responded to the dose‐series in the initial elicitation challenge; thus, 45 volunteers participated in study II. The anti‐inflammatory effect assessed by visual scoring In the post‐treatment study (study I), assessment by visual scoring revealed a significant anti‐inflammatory effect for clobetasol propionate and betamethasone valerate ( P  &lt; 0.001), while hydrocortisone was similar to vehicle. The same degree of inhibitory effects of clobetasol propionate and betamethasone valerate was found for both DPCP doses (Table  2 ).

 P ‐values &lt;0.05 are considered statistically significant (NS = not significant) The anti‐inflammatory effect assessed by skin ultrasound In study I, significant anti‐inflammatory effects ( P  &lt; 0.01) were shown at both 48 h and 72 h for betamethasone valerate and clobetasol propionate on challenge sites elicited by higher DPCP doses. Betamethasone valerate and clobetasol propionate reduced the inflammatory thickness up to 23.3% and 22.5%, respectively. For lower DPCP doses, the anti‐inflammatory effects were less pronounced (Figure  3 A, B). Figure 3 Anti‐inflammatory effects of topical drugs evaluated by skin ultrasound. (A, B) Post‐treatment at 48 h and 72 h using lower and higher diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP) doses; (C, D) pre‐treatment at 48 h and 72 h; (E, F) combined pre‐ and post‐treatment for 48 h and 72 h. SEM: standard error of the mean; TCS: topical corticosteroids; TCIs: topical calcineurin inhibitors; Pc: pimecrolimus; Tc: tacrolimus; HC: hydrocortisone; HCB: hydrocortisone butyrate; BV: betamethasone valerate; CP: clobetasol propionate. Asterisks indicate *  P  &lt; 0.05 and ** P  &lt; 0.01 In Study II (pre‐treatment of DPCP challenge sites), the anti‐inflammatory effects of tacrolimus were significant ( P  &lt; 0.01) at both 48 h and 72 h, with a 26% and 18% reduction in the inflammatory thickness, respectively. Betamethasone valerate ( P  &lt; 0.05) displayed significant inhibition (11.5%) only at 48 h compared with untreated (positive) DPCP control. For combined pre‐ and post‐treatment, there was a significant anti‐inflammatory effect of tacrolimus (28% reduction in inflammatory thickness at 48 h and 26.5% at 72 h;  P  &lt; 0.01), clobetasol propionate (28% at 48 h and 19% at 72 h;  P  &lt; 0.01), betamethasone valerate (22% at 48 h and 16% at 72 h;  P  &lt; 0.01), and hydrocortisone butyrate (11% at 72 h;  P  &lt; 0.01), while the effects of pimecrolimus and hydrocortisone were not significant in this model (Figure  3 C‐F). Discussion These studies showed that an  in vivo  human model using an inflammatory response driven by contact hypersensitivity to DPCP succeeded in ranking the anti‐inflammatory effect of four topical corticosteroid ointment preparations and two topical calcineurin inhibitors. Both visual assessment and objective measurement of DPCP induced skin inflammation (skin ultrasound thickness) were used. Three modes of application of the test drugs were explored; post‐treatment, pre‐treatment, and combined pre‐ and post‐treatment of DPCP‐induced allergic patch test reactions. Post‐treatment was used in the first study; however, this study only revealed a significant anti‐inflammatory effect for clobetasol propionate and betamethasone valerate. In the second study, two calcineurin inhibitors were included in addition to the four corticosteroids. The only topical drug showing a significant effect upon pre‐treatment was tacrolimus ointment, while the combined pre‐and post‐treatment design was successful in ranking all six products in the following order: tacrolimus 0.01% ointment ≥ clobetasol propionate ointment ≥ betamethasone valerate ointment ≥ hydrocortisone‐17‐butyrate ointment &gt; pimecrolimus cream = hydrocortisone ointment = vehicle ointment and cream and untreated (positive) DPCP control. DPCP elicited controlled, reliably reproducible, and acceptable degrees of allergic patch test reactions in sensitized volunteers. There were no dropouts, and several volunteers participated in 2–3 studies without noticeable adverse side effects. We have previously demonstrated that repeated DPCP challenges in newly sensitized volunteers results in a clinically reproducible and constant level of contact allergy measured by several  in vivo  and  in vitro  methods  14 ,  15 . This constitutes the ethical and scientific basis for the possibility of asking volunteers to participate in repeated tests for the purpose of developing a human model for testing topical anti‐inflammatory drugs. Previous studies attempted to develop appropriate  in vivo  models to assess the anti‐inflammatory effects of drugs using various types of inflammatory challenges. Experiments in human volunteers using skin irritants (e.g. nonanoic acid, sodium lauryl sulphate and sodium dodecyl sulphate) as model inflammatory agents showed that irritant skin reactions cannot be used as a tool in models testing the anti‐inflammatory effects of topical drugs  21 ,  22 ,  23 . Possible explanations for these failures include difficulty in standardization with regards to the choice of irritant, determining an adequate irritant concentration to elicit suitable irritant reactions, a pronounced interindividual variation in skin irritancy studies, and the lack of effect of systemically administered prednisone on irritant patch test reactions  21 ,  22 ,  23 ,  24 ,  25 . Several  in vivo  models have been developed that aimed to quantify the relative anti‐inflammatory potencies of topical corticosteroids using allergic hypersensitivity reactions elicited by environmental allergens in spontaneously sensitized patients. Most models used post‐treatment application of topical drugs because this represents the normal situation for clinical usage. Some studies have showed differences in the anti‐inflammatory effects of topical drugs on patch test reactions. Alomar  et al .  5  used visual scoring of nickel‐induced contact allergic reactions in a randomized, ointment‐controlled, double‐blind study. It was shown that topical tacrolimus 0.1% and mometasone furoate 0.1% applied under occlusion for 48 h as post‐treatment had significant inhibitory effects  5 . Queille‐Roussel  et al . also used nickel‐induced allergic reactions and reported that twice daily open application of pimecrolimus 0.2% and 0.6% was superior to vehicle and equal to betamethasone valerate 0.1%  4 . Only a few studies have used DNCB‐ and nickel‐induced allergic reactions to test the relative efficacy and safety of tacrolimus  in vivo  in humans by means of visual scoring  7 ,  26 ,  27 . These studies showed that tacrolimus was more effective than the corresponding vehicle in ameliorating allergic reactions to nickel and DNCB, respectively  7 ,  26 ,  27 . Not only is tacrolimus effective in suppressing allergic skin reactions in various animals and in man during the elicitation phase  28 ,  29 , there is also additional evidence to suggest that it may be efficacious when skin is treated before elicitation of allergic reactions  26 ,  29 . This prechallenge treatment effect may be explained on the basis that calcineurin inhibitors will exert significant suppressive effects on the cytokine response of resident memory T cells in the skin, thereby reducing their capacity to initiate the inflammatory process following exposure to an allergen  30 ,  31 . While the use of an experimental challenge with contact allergens would seem to be a highly appropriate and relevant form of inflammatory reaction for analysis of the anti‐inflammatory effects of drugs, use of spontaneously arising contact allergies in humans presents problems. First, suitable experimental subjects must be selected from the patient population who have spontaneous contact allergy to the desired allergen. Secondly, the process of eliciting reproducible responses with an appropriate strength of response is not straightforward. Many dose–response studies in nickel‐sensitive subjects have shown large intraindividual variation in the threshold dose that elicits a positive patch test reaction. The highest dose difference observed was 250‐fold  32 . Therefore, to obtain responses of similar intensity across test subjects, it is necessary to perform similar prechallenges to those we undertook. Thus, a prechallenge with a dose‐series could indicate the appropriate challenge doses to elicit mild to moderate inflammatory responses. The advantage of an experimental sensitizer such as DPCP is that it can be used on all healthy human volunteers. DPCP is a strong sensitizer that is able to sensitize virtually 100% of healthy humans. Stable and reproducible responses to DPCP skin challenge develop after the second exposure. By dose‐titration, it is possible to elicit low level inflammation, which creates a suitable inflammatory reaction to be able to discriminate between the different topical anti‐inflammatory drugs. Strong contact hypersensitivity reactions present too big a therapeutic challenge for existing topical anti‐inflammatory drugs, which reduces the possibility of revealing differences in their potency. Another important aspect of the DPCP model is the short application time (6 h) of the allergen challenge. This means that the treatment with the drugs can be started before the reaction is fully developed and increases the possibility of detecting effects that inhibit the processes involved in generating the inflammation. The main problem with initiating anti‐inflammatory treatment 48 h after the activation of the contact hypersensitivity response is that the reaction is virtually fully developed by that time, so the  task  for the anti‐inflammatory drugs is harder or possibly even different. Our data show that the combination of pre‐ and post‐treatment augments the sensitivity of detection. Because of the incomplete block design in study II, we could not select vehicle ointment as a reference point as we did in study I. It appears from Figure  3 E and 3F that vehicle (ointment and cream) enhanced the DPCP reactions, probably due to increased absorption. This is the first human  in vivo  model that has succeeded in comparing and ranking the anti‐inflammatory potency of various types of topical drugs, including both corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors. The DPCP model in healthy volunteers is a promising alternative to the vasoconstrictor assay, which is only relevant for corticosteroids. Furthermore, the traditional classification of topical corticosteroids has been questioned due to the fact that a strong vasoconstrictor effect, as determined by the vasoconstrictor assay, is not necessarily equivalent to a strong anti‐inflammatory effect  33 . To increase the chances of the model being able to detect more subtle differences between different active agents design modifications such as use of repeated applications of the drugs under test may be introduced to allow for a cumulative effect over time. Also, effects may be distinguished over longer repetitive challenges; hence, combining repeated DPCP exposures and drug applications could increase the sensitivity. This has proven useful in a few studies with nickel and tacrolimus  7 ,  27 . However, when several topical drugs are compared in each individual, we consider that occluded patches are needed to effectively control exposure. In conclusion, the DPCP model developed here could detect significant anti‐inflammatory effects for the three strongest groups of corticosteroids and tacrolimus, and offers a highly relevant alternative to the vasoconstrictor assay for topical drug potency testing.

    <Body>What is Already Known about this Subject 
 Pridopidine is a novel drug in development for treatment of Huntington's disease. It is believed to have partial affinity for the dopamine D2 receptor and its effects on motor symptoms may be related to its binding to the sigma‐1 receptor. A single dose of pridopidine undergoes hepatic metabolism by CYP2D6 with an elimination half‐life of 6 and 15 h for extensive and poor CYP2D6 metabolizers, respectively. Pridopidine exposure is thus higher in poor CYP2D6 metabolizers after a single administration. Following repeated administration, the pridopidine elimination half‐life is 10–14 h regardless of metabolizers genotype and the pridopidine exposure is similar for extensive and poor metabolizers under steady‐state conditions. 
 What this Study Adds 
 Pridopidine is a metabolism‐dependent inhibitor of its own metabolizing enzyme, CYP2D6. Exposure to metoprolol, a probe substrate for CYP2D6 inhibition, was markedly increased when coadministered with pridopidine. Food does not impact the exposure to pridopidine.

 Introduction 
 Pridopidine (4‐[3‐(methylsulfonyl)phenyl]‐1‐propylpidperidine; formerly known as ACR16, is an investigational drug under development by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries for treatment of Huntington's disease (HD; e.g., PRIDE‐HD, NCT02006472). HD is a rare neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) with an autosomal dominant model of inheritance and a prevalence of 1/100 000 to 5/100 000  5 ,  6 . In HD, progressive neurodegenerative processes in the CNS, particularly in the striatum, lead to motor impairment, cognitive decline and abnormal psychiatric symptoms  6 ,  7 . Pridopidine belongs to a new class of compounds known as dopidines and appears to normalize regulation of psychomotor behaviours in preclinical models  8 . Although the entire scope of biological activity for pridopidine is not established, it is known to bind to dopamine D2 receptors  9  and shows highly selective and robust affinity for sigma‐1 receptor (S1R)  10 . Recent findings suggest that the effects of pridopidine on motor behaviour abnormalities may be related to its binding to the S1R  11 . The S1R is an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein involved in cellular differentiation and neuroplasticity  12 . In Phase 2 trials conducted in patients with HD (i.e. HART, MermaiHD), the observed effects in the primary endpoints of the studies, the modified motor score of the Unified HD Rating Scale, in the pridopidine‐treated cohorts  vs.  the placebo group did not reach statistical significance although the directionality of the changes suggested a benefit of treatment with pridopidine. However, pridopidine improved the secondary endpoint, the total motor score  13 ,  14 ,  15 . In both studies, pridopidine was considered safe and well tolerated. Pridopidine is absorbed relatively rapidly after oral administration with time (t max ) to reach maximum observed plasma concentration (C max ) of roughly 2 h  16 . Pridopidine is  N ‐dealkylated by the polymorphic enzyme, cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) to an inactive metabolite TV‐45065 (formerly known as ACR30  17 . Pridopidine's elimination half‐life (t 1/2 ) after a single dose is approximately 6 and 15 h for extensive or poor metabolizers, respectively, and is approximately 10–14 h after repeated administration in both populations  16 . Accordingly, pridopidine exposure in poor metabolizers (11 192 ng h ml –1 ) is almost three times higher than in extensive metabolizers (3782 ng h ml –1 ) after a single dose. However, at steady state, poor and extensive metabolizers had comparable exposures (12 080 ng ml –1  and 9338 ng h ml –1 , respectively) due to a reduction in pridopidine elimination in extensive metabolizers over time. A similar pattern is seen for TV‐45065 with regard to half‐life. That is, the elimination half‐life is different between extensive and poor metabolizers after a single dose administration (approximately 8 and 32 h, respectively) but is similar after repeated administration (17 and 19 h, respectively). The primary objective of this report is to describe the  in vitro  studies that identified potential interactions of pridopidine with cytochrome P450 activity and the subsequent clinical study that characterized the impact of pridopidine on CYP2D6 activity  in vivo . Following the European Medicines Agency guidelines, metoprolol was used as the CYP2D6 probe of choice for this study because it is a substrate of this CYP isoenzyme and is acknowledged for use as a pharmacological marker to evaluate the inhibitory potential of the drug in question  18 . Dosing of pridopidine to steady state represented the more clinically relevant scenario, which was equally important given autoinhibition of CYP2D6 by pridopidine. Additional objectives of the clinical study included the assessment of the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of pridopidine as well as the safety and tolerability of pridopidine. 
 Methods 
 In vitro inhibition/induction of cytochromes P450 Evaluation of pridopidine as a CYP inhibitor The ability of pridopidine and TV‐45065 to inhibit and/or induce the  in vitro  activity of major drug metabolizing enzymes was assessed according to standard practices  18 ,  19 ,  20 . Inhibition experiments assessed changes in enzymatic activity in human liver microsomes (HLM) by quantitation of the relevant metabolic transformation of probe substrates specific for CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5 following incubation in the presence of pridopidine or TV‐45065. Briefly, pridopidine and TV‐45065 were incubated with probe substrates and pooled HLM at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 500 μmol l –1  pridopidine and 0.05 to 50 μmol l –1  TV‐45065. These concentrations represent the levels administered clinically and up to &gt;100‐fold higher. Time‐ or metabolism‐dependent CYP inhibition was assessed by preincubating pridopidine (or TV‐45065) with microsomes for 30 min in the absence or presence of NADPH, respectively. For the determination of CYP2D6 inhibitor potency (K i ), activity was assessed using dextromethorphan concentrations ranging from 2.25 to 75 μmol l –1  and pridopidine concentrations ranging from 9.25 to 370 μmol l –1 . Additionally, the reversibility of CYP2D6 inhibition by pridopidine was assessed by incubating pridopidine and microsomes for 30 min with NADPH followed by 10 min in the presence or absence of 2 mmol l –1  ferricyanide. Freshly isolated cultured human hepatocytes were treated with pridopidine (at 0.1–100 μmol l –1 ) for 3 consecutive days followed by isolation of microsomes  21 . Isolated microsomes were preincubated with pridopidine and NADPH as described above, and then re‐isolated using ultracentrifugation of the incubation mixtures and washed prior to 5‐min incubation with dextromethorphan. Metabolism‐dependent inhibition (MDI) of CYP2D6 by pridopidine was further evaluated by incubating pridopidine with human liver microsomes hourly (1–4 h) prior to a dextromethorphan O‐demethylation assay. To assess whether flavin‐containing monooxygenase (FMO) enzymes may be contributing to the observed MDI of CYP2D6 by pridopidine, FMO was inactivated by exposing human liver microsomes to 50°C for 2 min prior to 2 h preincubation and dextromethorphan O‐demethylation as described above. Additional details can be found in Supplementary Tables  S1  and  S2 . Evaluation of pridopidine and TV‐45065 as a CYP inducer Induction experiments assessed changes in enzymatic activity and mRNA levels for CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5 in cultured human hepatocytes following treatment with pridopidine or TV‐45065. Three preparations of freshly isolated human hepatocytes, each from a single donor  22 ,  23 ,  24  were treated daily for 3 days with vehicle control, one of four concentrations of test article (0.1, 1, 10, or 100 μmol l –1  pridopidine or 0.05, 0.5, 5 or 50 μmol l –1  TV‐45065), or one of three known human CYP enzyme inducers: omeprazole (100 μmol l –1 ), phenobarbital (750 μmol l –1 ) or rifampcin (10 μmol l –1 ). Approximately 24 h following the final treatment, microsomes were isolated  22 , protein levels were quantified using BCA (bicinchoninic acid) methodology  25 , and CYP activity was assessed as described above, except that protein concentrations ranged from 0.020 to 0.1 mg ml –1  and reactions were allowed to proceed for 10 or 30 min. RNA was isolated and purified, and its integrity and levels were determined. Quantitative RT‐PCR was performed in triplicate. Relative quantity of target cDNA was compared to GAPDH (glyceraldehyde‐3‐phosphate dehydrogenase) cDNA using the ΔΔCt method. Further details can be found in the Supplementary Appendix. Data analysis Where possible, IC 50  calculations were performed using nonlinear regression (per the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm) and K i  values were determined by processing data using a LIMS (including Galileo version 3.3, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., and reporting tool, Crystal Reports 2008, SAP). The entire data set (i.e., reaction rates at all concentrations of pridopidine and TV‐45065, at all marker substrate concentrations) was fit with Michaelis–Menten equations for competitive, noncompetitive, uncompetitive and mixed (competitive‐noncompetitive) inhibition by nonlinear regression analysis. The goodness of fit to each inhibition model was indicated by a lower Akaike information criterion value, which provided an initial basis for selection of the type of inhibition. Induction was evaluated through folds increase of relevant CYP isoform activity in separated HLM, and through increase in relevant CYP isoform mRNA levels following incubation of the hepatocytes with pridopidine or TV‐45065 compared to vehicle control and with comparison to a relevant prototypical inducer positive control, where applicable. Clinical evaluation Study design The phase‐1 clinical study was conducted at the Early Phase Clinical Unit of Parexel, International GmbH Berlin, Germany, and was approved by the responsible Independent Ethics Committee (Landesamt für Gesundheit und Soziales, Ethik‐Kommission Berlin, Germany) and relevant Competent Authority (BfArM, Bundesinstitut fürArzneimittel und Medizinprodukte, Germany). All subjects signed informed consent, and the study was conducted in compliance with International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. A total of 22 healthy subjects (11 male and 11 female; age 18–65 years) participated in the study. The subjects were genotyped to exclude poor metabolizers for CYP2D6. The following alleles were analysed: *2, *3, *4, *5, *6, *7, *8, *9, *10, *35, *41 and *MxN; and poor metabolizer genotype was assigned if the subject had two nonfunctional CYP2D6 alleles. Other standard inclusion/exclusion criteria for clinical pharmacology studies in healthy volunteers were applied, such as limitations on smoking (&lt;10 cigarettes/day), the presence or history of any clinically significant diseases known to interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs as judged by the investigator, and prohibition of concomitant medications other than acetaminophen and those used to treat an adverse event. The randomized open‐label study consisted of a single‐sequence crossover drug–drug interaction (DDI) evaluation and a randomized crossover food effect (FE) assessment in three periods. As described below and in Figure  1 , the DDI evaluation single‐sequence part was carried out in Period 1 (metoprolol alone) and Period 3 (metoprolol with steady‐state pridopidine) while the FE assessment was conducted in Period 2 and 3 when pridopidine was administered as a single dose. Given the time‐dependent inhibition of CYP2D6, and pridopidine being a substrate of CYP2D6, it was deemed more clinically relevant for the assessment to occur when pridopidine was at steady‐state. Figure 1 Study design Use of prescribed medication or over‐the‐counter (OTC) medication within 2 weeks prior to dosing, or use of any drug or substance that was known to induce or inhibit metoprolol for 30 days or 5 half‐lives (whichever was longer) prior to admission (Period 1, Day −1), except for paracetamol was excluded. Inhibitors and inducers of CYP2D6, antidepressant and medication known for causing significant QT‐prolongation such as antiarrhythmic drugs class Ia and II were not allowed within 30 days prior to admission to the clinic. Xanthine‐containing products, alcohol or alcohol‐containing products were restricted from 2 days prior to admission until end of treatment phase. Grapefruit or grapefruit‐juice‐containing products (including Seville oranges, bitter oranges and pomelos) were excluded from 7 days prior to admission (Period 1, Day −1) until end of treatment phase. Screening took place within 28 days prior to dosing of metoprolol in Period 1. Subjects were housed in the clinic for the duration of the study (Periods 1–3) apart from days 4–7 of Period 3. During Period 1, 100 mg metoprolol  26  was given as a single oral dose on Day 1 after an overnight fast, and PK samples for metoprolol concentration were collected from predose up to 24 h postdose. After 3 days of washout, subjects were randomly assigned to receive a single 90‐mg oral dose of pridopidine (two capsules of 45 mg) under fed or fasted conditions, with PK samples being collected from predose up to 48 h postdose. The composition of the test meal, which was given 30 min prior to dosing, was per FDA Guidance on Food‐Effect Bioavailability and Fed Bioequivalence Studies  27  (high‐fat, high‐calorie). After an additional 4 days of washout and on Day 1 of Period 3, a second single 90‐mg oral dose of pridopidine was administered under fed or fasted conditions (crossover with FE Period 2). Starting on day 3 of Period 3, multiple doses of 45 mg pridopidine were administered twice daily (BID) for 7 days. A 6‐h period separated the morning and afternoon doses of pridopidine, similar to the dosing instruction given to patients with HD. Trough PK samples were collected on Days 6–8 to confirm attainment of steady state. On the last day of dosing (Day 9 Period 3), 100 mg metoprolol was administered with the afternoon dose of pridopidine, 6 h after the morning pridopidine dose. PK sampling for pridopidine and metoprolol were collected predose and at multiple times through 66 h postdose. A follow‐up visit was conducted 5–10 days after the last dose of study drug. Safety of study subjects was assessed by physical examinations, laboratory parameters (clinical chemistry, haematology including coagulation and urinalysis), vital signs and electrocardiograms (ECGs), concomitant medications, and adverse events monitoring. ECGs were obtained on Day 1 of each treatment period and on Day 9 of Period 3 before the morning dose, and at 1, 2 and 12 h postdose. On all other days except baseline (Day −1 of each period) ECGs were obtained before the morning dose. Bioanalytical methods Pridopidine, TV‐45065 and metoprolol concentrations in plasma were determined using validated LC–MS/MS methods. Pridopidine, TV‐45065, and their respective internal standards were extracted from human EDTA plasma by solid phase extraction using Evolute CX cartridges and 1.25% ammonia in methanol–water (95:5,  v /v) elution. Metoprolol and its d 7  internal standard were extracted from EDTA plasma by liquid–liquid extraction into tert‐butyl‐methyl‐ether at alkaline pH. Following extraction samples were injected into a liquid chromatograph equipped with a tandem mass spectrometry detector. Separations were performed on a reversed‐phase column (XBridge C 18 , 50 × 2.1 mm ID, 5 μm, Waters) with a mobile phase of 60% water with 0.05% ammonia and 40% acetonitrile. Calibration range was 1.41–1400 ng ml –1  for pridopidine, 0.240–120 ng ml –1  for TV‐45065 and 0.300–300 ng ml –1  for metoprolol. The assay passed linearity for pridopidine ( r  = 0.9996), TV‐45065 ( r  = 0.9991) and metoprolol ( r  = 0.9991) over each of the calibration ranges tested. Mean accuracy values for pridopidine, TV‐45065 and metoprolol were ±5%, ±8.6% ±3.6%, respectively. Selectivity was confirmed and no interference of any of the analytes of any of the other analytes was observed. PK analysis PK parameters were calculated by standard noncompartmental methods using Phoenix WinNonlin version 5.2 (Pharsight, St Louis, MO, USA). Concentrations below the LLOQ were set to zero when preceding the first measurable concentration and set to LLOQ/2 when between measurable samples and excluded following the last quantifiable sample. The terminal elimination rate constant (λ z ) was estimated by linear regression of logarithmically‐transformed concentration–time data. Terminal elimination t 1/2  was calculated as ln(2)/λ z . The maximum observed plasma concentration (C max ) and time to reach C max  (t max ) were obtained directly from the concentration–time data. Area under the plasma concentration–time curve from time 0 to the time t of the last quantifiable concentration (AUC 0–last ) was calculated by means of the mixed log‐linear trapezoidal rule. The AUC from time zero to infinity (AUC 0–∞ ) after a single dose was calculated as the sum of AUC 0–last  and AUC extrap  where AUC extrap  is C last /λ z . The area under the plasma concentration–time curve from time zero to the end of the dosing interval, tau, for the morning and evening dose (AUC AM , AUC PM ) was calculated by means of the mixed log‐linear trapezoidal rule. As the afternoon dose of pridopidine was given 6 h after the morning dose of pridopidine, the AUC intervals from the timing of the morning dose were 6, 18 or 24 h. The steady‐state equilibrium ratio was calculated as AUC 0–24PM,ss /AUC 0–∞,sd . The accumulation ratio (R acc ) was calculated as AUC 0–24PM, ss  / AUC 0–24,sd . Statistical analysis The drug interaction between pridopidine and metoprolol was evaluated according to guidelines  28 ,  29 ,  30 . The point estimate and 90% confidence interval (CI) for the ratio of geometric means of AUC 0–last , AUC 0–∞  and C max  of metoprolol (with or without pridopidine) were compared to the bioequivalence range of 0.80–1.25. The primary endpoints were calculated with a linear model on the log‐transformed parameters including sequence, treatment and period as fixed effects and subject (sequence) as random effect. As a secondary analysis, t max  and t 1/2  of metoprolol were analysed for differences by calculating the Hodges–Lehmann estimator for the median difference together with the corresponding exact 90% CI for small sample sizes. To evaluate the FE, AUC 0–last , AUC 0–∞  and C max  of pridopidine were log‐transformed and analysed for differences between treatments (fed  vs.  fasted) using an analysis of variance model including period (Periods 2 and 3), treatment and sequence as fixed effects and subjects within sequence as random effect. The primary endpoints (AUC 0–∞  and C max ) and secondary endpoint (t max ) were analysed as described above for the DDI analysis. Additionally, AUC 0–∞  of Day 1 in fasting condition pooled  vs.  AUC 0–24  of Day 9 in fasting condition (Period 3), were compared to examine PK linearity at steady‐state equilibrium using 90% confidence intervals constructed for the ratio of the geometric means. 
 Results 
 In vitro results Evaluation of pridopidine and TV‐45065 as CYP inhibitors Pridopidine did not show any direct or time‐ (or metabolism‐) dependent inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP3A4/5 when investigated in HLM at concentrations of 0–500 μmol l –1  (Supple mental Table S1 ). Weak direct inhibition was observed towards CYP2D6. Further investigation revealed pridopidine as a competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 with a K i  of 33 μmol l –1  (Figure  2 ). Figure 2 Inhibition of CYP2D6 by pridopidine: K i  determination Very weak metabolism‐dependent inhibition (NADPH‐dependent) was observed after a 30‐min preincubation (less than a 1.3‐fold decrease in IC 50  values). The time‐/metabolism‐dependent inhibition of CYP2D6 was further investigated in human liver microsomes with preincubation times of 2, 3 and 4 h. After 4 h of preincubation with NADPH, an approximate 14‐fold shift was observed in the IC 50  value, indicating metabolism‐dependent inhibition. In agreement with the inhibition experiments described above, treatment of hepatocyte cultures with up to 100 μmol l –1  pridopidine resulted in a statistically significant, concentration‐dependent decrease in CYP2D6 activity of up to 64.2% when compared to the vehicle control (0.1% DMSO). The metabolism‐dependent inhibition of CYP2D6 was not reversed with microsomal re‐isolation or by the addition of potassium ferricyanide, suggesting that pridopidine is an irreversible metabolism‐dependent inhibitor of CYP2D6. In addition, heat treatment of the human liver microsomes to inactivate FMO did not affect pridopidine CYP2D6 MDI extent, suggesting that FMO was not involved in the metabolic conversion resulting in the observed metabolism‐dependent inhibition (Table  1 ).

 39 42 2.8 a Microsomes were heat treated to inactivate flavin‐containing monooxygenase The main metabolite of pridopidine, TV‐45065, did not show any direct inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2C8/9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A4. However, time‐/metabolism‐dependent inhibition of CYP2D6 was also observed for TV‐45065, although the IC 50  value was above 50 μmol l –1 , suggesting that TV‐45065 is unlikely to be directly responsible for the observed MDI. Irreversible inhibition parameters, K inact  and K I , could not be determined, due to the  in vitro  instability of CYP2D6 in the presence of its probe substrate (data not shown). Evaluation of pridopidine and TV‐45065 as CYP inducers Treatment with up to 100 μmol l –1  pridopidine caused little (&lt;2‐fold change) or no increase in CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 mRNA levels (data not shown) in any of the three tested hepatocyte cultures. In addition, treatment of cultured human hepatocytes with up to 100 μmol l –1  pridopidine had little (less than 2‐fold change) or no effect on CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP3A4/5 activity (data not shown). Overall, treatment of cultured human hepatocytes with up to 50 μmol l –1  TV‐45065 for three consecutive days caused little or no effect on CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP3A4/5 activity, or mRNA expression (on average, ≤2.0‐fold increase and ≤20% as effective as the respective positive control CYP inducers). In vivo results Subject disposition and demographics A total of 11 females and 11 males of Caucasian ethnicity were enrolled in the study. Average demographic characteristics of subjects were as follows: mean (SD) age 51.3 (6.7) years, height 172 (10.8) cm, weight 74.3 (11.8) kg and body mass index 25.0 (2.72) kg/m 2 . Of the enrolled subjects, safety assessments were completed for all subjects, and PK was assessed for 21 subjects, as one subject withdrew on Day 15 from the study after breaking her arm, which was not considered study drug‐related. Safety Study treatments were well tolerated in general, apart from minor deviations from normal laboratory ranges, there were no findings in haematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation or urinalysis that constituted an adverse effect (AE). An increase in pulse rate by up to 12 beats min –1  was observed in subjects treated with pridopidine 45 mg BID. No clinically significant changes in remaining vital signs, 12‐lead ECG parameters or physical examination were observed. There was a total of 40 recorded AEs in 15 subjects (68.2%) in this study, six AEs during the food‐effect portion and 34 AEs during the DDI portion of the study (Supplement Table  S3 ). All AEs were of mild ( n =  35) or moderate ( n =  5) intensity. The most frequent AE in the DDI single‐sequence part was  feeling hot  ( n =  8; 36.4%) during the coadministration of metoprolol and pridopidine, followed by nausea (18.2%) during the period of BID dosing of pridopidine. It is noteworthy that amnestic aphasia was reported by two subjects (9.1%) following BID administration of pridopidine. These events occurred on the 3 rd  and 6 th  day of Period 3, respectively. In the FE crossover part, AEs occurred only as single incidences; therefore, a most frequent AE could not be specified. Impact of pridopidine on metoprolol pharmacokinetics The plasma concentration–time plots of metoprolol alone and under coadministration of pridopidine at steady state showed that the exposure to metoprolol was larger when it was coadministered with pridopidine (Figure  3 ). The exposure to metoprolol was markedly increased when coadministered with pridopidine as shown by the 3.5‐fold increase in mean C max , 6.5‐fold increase in mean AUC 0–last , and 5.1‐fold increase in mean AUC 0–∞ . As shown in Table  2 , the geometric mean ratio and 90% CIs entirely exceeded the upper no‐effect boundary of 1.25 for C max  and AUC. The t max  (approximately 2 h) values were comparable between the two periods; however, the range of t max  was longer during the coadministration with pridopidine (1–4 h) compared to metoprolol alone (0.75–2 h). This difference is not considered to be of clinical relevance. The median t ½  was prolonged from 3.7 to 5.6 h when metoprolol was coadministered with pridopidine, which is consistent with the inhibition of CYP2D6 by pridopidine.

 Discussion 
 Of the CYP enzymes tested  in vitro , pridopidine showed inhibitory potential only for CYP2D6. The direct, competitive inhibitory potential (K i ) of pridopidine (33 μmol l –1  or 9300 ng ml –1 ) was roughly 30‐fold higher than mean peak concentrations of pridopidine in plasma following a single 45‐mg dose (303 ng ml –1 ) and roughly 15‐fold higher than mean peak concentrations of pridopidine in plasma at steady state following 14 days of 45 mg BID dosing (620 ng ml –1 ) as reported in a previous study of pridopidine  16 . Since the I/K i  ratio is smaller than the conservative threshold of 0.1, a significant interaction would not be expected solely due to reversible, competitive inhibition of CYP2D6  28 . However, the irreversible metabolism‐dependent inhibition of CYP2D6 seen in both microsomes and hepatocytes provides evidence that pridopidine could cause CYP2D6‐related interactions through mechanisms other than competitive inhibition. To test the interaction potential in a clinically relevant dosing regimen, pridopidine was dosed to steady state, and the FDA‐recommended CYP2D6 probe substrate, metoprolol, was coadministered. Pridopidine caused statistically significant and clinically relevant increases in metoprolol AUC (up to 5‐fold) and peak concentrations (up to 3‐fold), and prolonged the elimination phase, indicating that pridopidine is a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity  in vivo . As steady‐state pridopidine concentrations are reached, pridopidine inhibits CYP2D6, which in turn reduces its own hepatic clearance pathway leaving renal excretion as the primary route of elimination  31 . The pridopidine AUC 0–24,ss  calculated in this study is consistent with those reported by Lindskov  16  for CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, indicating that the auto‐inhibition of CYP2D6 acts as a source of phenoconversion. This finding is supported by the 2‐fold ratio of AUC 0–24PM  of the 45‐mg pridopidine dose at steady state to the AUC 0– ∞  of the 90‐mg single dose of pridopidine which would have been expected to be 0.5, if pridopidine displayed linear kinetics. In essence, multiple doses of pridopidine decrease the activity of CYP2D6 in extensive metabolizers into the range of CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. The results of this study are important for treatment of HD patients as coadministration of pridopidine once approved with other CYP2D6 substrates may result in clinically significant DDIs. Specifically, systemic levels of coadministered CYP2D6 substrates may increase with chronic dosing of pridopidine and approaches those observed in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. Myriad CNS‐active drugs, including multiple drugs used concomitantly in patients with HD (e.g. risperidone, sertraline, paroxetine), are also metabolized by CYP2D6  32 ,  33 . Adequate clinical monitoring should therefore be exercised when pridopidine is coadministered with other CYP2D6 substrates. The FE portion of this study demonstrated that the plasma concentration profiles of pridopidine meet bioequivalence criteria between the fed and fasted states, indicating that there is no significant FE and that pridopidine can be administered with or without meals. While the C max  and AUC values were similar, the t max  was slightly delayed as expected due to the slower gastric emptying rate under fed conditions  34 . In summary, the results from this study provide valuable data on factors that may impact dosing of medications metabolized by CYP2D6 when concomitantly administered with pridopidine.

    <Body>What is Already Known about this Subject 
 α 1 ‐Acid glycoprotein (AAG), which is a major binding protein of docetaxel, is regarded as a determinant for docetaxel pharmacokinetics. Docetaxel‐induced severe haematological toxicity occurs more frequently in the elderly, whereas there are no significant age‐related differences in the pharmacokinetics. 
 What this Study Adds 
 Regardless of ageing, serum AAG level that increases in cancer patients determines docetaxel unbound exposure and related dose‐limiting toxicity. Neutropenia can be predicted by serum AAG level and absolute neutrophil count at baseline for patients of all ages following the administration of docetaxel. 
 Introduction As the population ages, a significant and rapidly increasing number of older cancer patients require treatments appropriate for age‐related physiological changes affecting pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in elderly individuals. As such, the International Society of Geriatric Oncology published clinical practice recommendations for dose adjustments of renally excreted cancer drugs in geriatric patients  1 ,  2  that take into consideration the decline in renal function with ageing  3 . Unfortunately, no dosing information for non‐renally excreted cancer drugs has been provided for this population. Predominantly eliminated by hepatic metabolism,  docetaxel  shows effective antitumor activity against numerous tumours, and is approved for treatment of breast cancer, non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), hormone‐refractory prostate cancer, gastric adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck  4 . Docetaxel monotherapy is one of the standard approaches for pre‐treated NSCLC patients  5 ,  6 , and is a first‐line treatment for older patients aged ≥70 or 75 years  7 ,  8 ,  9 . Previous reports suggesting older patients (aged ≥65 or 75 years) were more sensitive to docetaxel‐induced neutropenia indicate the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel were unaltered; however, severe haematological toxicity was observed more frequently in the older patient population  10 ,  11 . As docetaxel is extensively bound to serum proteins (binding percentage &gt; 90%), the concentration of unbound docetaxel correlates with both beneficial and harmful effects of the drug. According to binding parameters, it is thought the major binding protein of docetaxel is α 1 ‐acid glycoprotein (AAG) rather than albumin (ALB)  12 . Hence, variability of serum AAG levels contributes to differences in the unbound fraction and systemic clearance of docetaxel. Area under the concentration–time curve (AUC) of total docetaxel during the first course and baseline serum AAG levels have previously been shown to be independent predictors of treatment efficacy in NSCLC patients  13 ,  14 . Moreover, first‐course total and unbound exposure of docetaxel, as well as baseline serum AAG levels, are related to severity of haematological toxicity  13 ,  14 ,  15 ,  16 . Based on these pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics, the aim of this study was to prospectively elucidate the effects of advanced age and serum AAG level on docetaxel unbound exposure and neutropenia, a dose‐limiting toxicity, in cancer patients. Patients and Methods Eligibility Patients ≥20 years of age were eligible if they had pathologically confirmed NSCLC with a plan to receive docetaxel monotherapy. Patients with interstitial pneumonitis identified by chest X‐ray were excluded. Study design The objective was to evaluate the impacts of the advanced age and serum AAG level on unbound docetaxel exposure and neutropenia in cancer patients. Baseline serum levels of AAG and ALB were measured before administration of docetaxel. US National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 was used to assess neutropenia as neutrophil counts decreased  17 . The study duration included the first 3‐week course. This study protocol was approved by the institutional review board at Shizuoka Cancer Center in Shizuoka, Japan, where the study was conducted. This study was registered at the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN 000014701). Study procedures were in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient prior to enrolment. Drug treatment Docetaxel (Taxotere ® ; Sanofi K.K., Japan) monotherapy was administered over the course of 1 h at a dose of 60 mg m −2  once every 3 weeks to patients with an adequate bone marrow reserve. Dexamethasone was administered at a dose of 8 mg before docetaxel treatment. Pharmacokinetic sampling and assay Blood samples were obtained five times: before infusion, just before the end of a 1‐h infusion, and at 10–60 min, 2–5 h, and 12–24 h after the end of the infusion. Peripheral blood samples (6 ml) were drawn into vacuumed tubes at each sampling time and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature. Resulting serum was frozen and stored at −80°C until analysis. Concentration of docetaxel was determined with an ultra‐performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)‐tandem mass spectrometry technique modified from a previously reported method  18  and developed specifically for this study. Docetaxel and paclitaxel, an internal standard, were purchased from Sigma‐Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA). The UPLC‐tandem mass spectrometry system was equipped with an Acquity UPLC system and a Xevo TQ MS spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). Chromatographic separations were obtained under gradient conditions with an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (100 mm × 2.1 mm inner diameter, 1.7 μm particle size; Waters). The mobile phase consisted of eluent A (10 mM ammonium formate containing 0.2% formic acid) and eluent B (acetonitrile). The mass spectrometer was run in positive mode, and the multiple reaction monitoring mode detected 808.7 &gt; 226.2 and 854.7 &gt; 105.0 for docetaxel and paclitaxel, respectively. Chromatographic data were acquired and analysed with MassLynx equipped with QuanLynx (Waters). Concentration of docetaxel in patient serum samples was calculated by determining the ratio of the area of docetaxel to the area of the internal standard in each sample and by comparing these ratios to a standard curve prepared on the same day as the samples. The concentration range of standard curves was 10–4000 ng ml −1 
 .  The bias and precision of quality control samples were less than 15%. At the lower limit of assay quantitation, bias and precision were less than 20%, as per guidelines provided in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance for Industry Bioanalytic Method Validation  19 . Interday and intraday variabilities in precision (expressed as the coefficient of variation) ranged from 9.2% to 11.8% and from 2.9% to 8.1%, respectively. Average accuracies ranged from 92.3% to 98.3%. The unbound fraction of docetaxel in serum 10–60 min after the end of infusion was obtained by equilibrium dialysis, which was conducted in a shaking incubator at 37°C for 6 h using 96‐well microdialysis plates (HTD96b, HTDialysis, CT, USA). The dialysis compartments in each well were separated by a regenerated cellulose membrane (Dialysis Membrane Strips MWCO 12‐14 kDa, HTDialysis). Experiments were carried out with 150‐μl plasma aliquots in an equal volume of Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan). Population pharmacokinetic (PPK) analysis PPK analysis was performed with NONMEM version 7.3.0 (PDx‐POP 4.10; ICON Development Solutions, Dublin, Ireland). The pharmacokinetic model was a two‐compartment structural model with first order elimination (subroutines ADVAN3 and TRANS3). Basic pharmacokinetic parameters of docetaxel included total body clearance (CL), volumes of distribution of the central compartment (V c ) and at steady state ( V 
 ss ), and intercompartmental clearance ( Q ). AUC was computed as AUC = Dose/CL. Interindividual variability was assumed to obey a log‐normal distribution and is described for each parameter as follows:
 (1) θj = θ × exp ηj where  η 
 j  is the random effect for individual  j ,  θ  is the population mean parameter, and  η  is a random variable with mean zero and variance  ω 
 2 . Residual variability was described by a proportional error model as follows:
 (2) C i , j = Cpred i , j exp ε i , j where Cpred i, j  is the  i th model‐predicted concentration for patient  j ,  C 
 i ,  j  is the measured concentration, and  ε 
 i ,  j  denotes the residual intraindividual random error. Demographic variables of age, as well as serum levels of AAG and ALB, were examined to identify whether these variables could explain the observed substantial interindividual variability. Demographic variables, which were considered continuous, were included one at a time by stepwise selection based on a likelihood ratio test. Minimum values of the NONMEM objective function were used as a statistic for choosing suitable models during the model‐building process. Potentially significant covariates were identified as factors that, when added to the basic model individually, resulted in a decrease in the objective function of 3.84 or more ( P  &lt; 0.05). Exposure‐toxicity analysis The percent decrease in absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was defined as:
 (3) Percent decrease in ANC = Pretreatment ANC − Nadir ANC Pretreatment ANC × 100 and the relationship between percent decrease in ANC at nadir and unbound AUC ( fu ·AUC) of docetaxel was described by a sigmoid  E 
 max  model:
 (4) P ercent decrease in ANC = Emax × fu · AUC γ EC 50 γ + fu · AUC γ where  E 
 max  represents the maximal effect and EC 50  is the  fu ·AUC value at which 50% of the maximum effect occurs. The exponent γ is a shape factor that determines the steepness of the response curve. Covariates capable of affecting  E 
 max  and EC 50  were tested for age, gender and baseline ANC by univariate and multivariate analyses. Computations were made using NONMEM. Statistical analysis All categorical variables were analysed using a chi‐square or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. Continuous variables between two groups were analysed using the Mann–Whitney U‐test. Linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between continuous variables and docetaxel pharmacokinetic parameters. All  P ‐values were reported as two‐sided and values &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results Between August 2014 and May 2015, 51 Japanese patients (34 aged &lt;75 and 17 aged ≥75 years) were enrolled into this study. All patients were assessable for pharmacokinetics, and 49 patients were also evaluated for neutropenia because two patients were excluded due to prophylactic administration of granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor (CSF). Patient demographics and characteristics listed in Table  1  were similar between patients aged &lt;75 years and patients aged ≥75 years, except for the number of prior treatments. Older patients had received fewer previous chemotherapies ( P  &lt; 0.0001). No significant differences in serum levels of AAG and ALB, or ANC at baseline existed between the two cohorts.

 P  &lt; 0.05 Pharmacokinetics Serum concentration–time profiles of total docetaxel in patients aged ≥75 years and &lt;75 years are shown in Figure  1 . Individual CL was plotted against a patient's factors to examine any correlations (Figure  2 ). A moderate association was observed between decreased CL and increased age ( R 
 2  = 0.086,  P  &lt; 0.05; Figure  2 A), whereas strong correlations existed between CL and serum AAG level ( R 
 2  = 0.505,  P  &lt; 0.0001; Figure  2 B) and inversely between CL and serum ALB level ( R 
 2  = 0.483,  P  &lt; 0.0001; Figure  2 C). According to univariate analyses, CL, V c  and V ss  of docetaxel were significantly associated with serum levels of both AAG and ALB ( P  &lt; 0.001), but not with age (Table  S1 ). Multivariate analysis showed that serum AAG level was the only significant factor affecting CL of docetaxel ( P  &lt; 0.001; Table  S1 ). However, serum ALB level was significantly associated with V c  ( P  &lt; 0.005; Table  S1 ). Estimated PPK parameters are summarized in Table  2 .

Pharmacokinetic parameters in patients aged &lt;75 years and ≥75 years of age are listed in Table  3 . Total docetaxel pharmacokinetic parameters, including C max , V c  and V ss , were not different between the two cohorts.

However, this observation did not reach a level of statistical significance ( P  = 0.084 and  P  = 0.071, respectively).

Unbound fraction Degree of unbound fraction varied from 3.1% to 15.6% (median = 8.1%) in 51 patients, as shown in Figure  3 A. There was no association between degree of unbound fraction and age ( R 
 2  = 0.042; Figure  3 B), in accordance with no significant difference in the degree of unbound fraction between patients aged &lt;75 years and ≥75 years, as shown in Table  3 . The degree of unbound fraction weakly correlated with serum AAG levels ( R 
 2  = 0.149,  P  &lt; 0.01; Figure  3 C), but not with serum ALB ( R 
 2  = 0.073; Figure  3 D). Figure 3 Distribution of the unbound fraction of docetaxel (A) and correlations between the degree of unbound fraction and age (B), α 1 ‐acid glycoprotein (AAG) (C) and albumin (ALB) (D). N.S., not statistically significant Neutropenia Thirty‐three patients aged &lt;75 years and 16 patients aged ≥75 years were assessable for neutropenia. Only one patient experienced febrile neutropenia. Percent decrease in ANC at nadir and the number of patients with each grade of neutropenia are summarized in Table  3 . Percent decrease in ANC at nadir was significantly greater in patients aged ≥75 years (85.2 ± 9.3%) than in patients aged &lt;75 years (76.4 ± 13.2%,  P  &lt; 0.05). As shown in Figure  4 A, percent decrease in ANC at nadir was related to  fu ·AUC, but not to total AUC ( P  = 0.628, not shown). Exposure‐toxicity analysis using Eq.  (4)  revealed that EC 50  was dependent on ANC value at baseline, but not on age and gender ( Table S2 , Table  2  and Figure  4 A). In addition, the percentage of patients with grade 4 neutropenia was higher in the ≥75 years group ( P  &lt; 0.05; Table  3 ). The box plot in Figure  4 B shows a decrease in ANC at baseline occurs with increasing grade of neutropenia ( P  &lt; 0.05).

The serum level of AAG, a major binding protein of docetaxel, is considered to be a determinant for docetaxel pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. However, there are no reports about the impact of serum AAG on exposure and toxicity in elderly patients treated with docetaxel. Therefore, this prospective study investigated the effects of advanced age and serum AAG level on pharmacokinetics and related neutropenia of docetaxel in cancer patients by assessing actual unbound drug fraction ( fu ). Docetaxel CL was found to be associated with serum AAG level regardless of age (Figure  2 , Table  S1  and Table  2 ). AAG is an acute phase reactant, and its serum level is increased in disease states such as cancer, burns and acute myocardial infarction  21 . It is also known that serum ALB levels are low in critically ill patients because of altered distribution between intravascular and extravascular compartments  22 . Thus, decreased ALB levels might mitigate increases in AAG, explaining why no effect is observed in some of the studies that focus on AAG only. Therefore, the correlation between CL and serum ALB level, observed to be significant in univariate analysis (Figure  2 , Table  S1 ), is deemed to be solely apparent. ALB is a significant covariate affecting  V 
 c  but not CL (Table  S1 , Table  2 ). In a previous study, AAG was identified to be a significant predictor of total docetaxel CL, with high AAG levels being associated with reduced total docetaxel CL  23 . Our result is consistent with this report and verifies this relationship in a wide range of ages from 34 to 84 years. This observation also shows that docetaxel has a low hepatic extraction ratio because the unbound fraction, as determined by AAG level (Figure  3 C), correlated with total CL. In addition, moderate hepatic dysfunction has been reported to decrease docetaxel CL  23 ,  24 ,  25 . However, only one patient aged &lt;75 years had moderate hepatic dysfunction (AST 76 U l −1 , ALT 57 U l −1 ) in our study, as shown in Table  1 . Therefore, the influence of hepatic function on docetaxel pharmacokinetics was not evaluable in this patient population. Other currently known factors of interindividual variability in docetaxel pharmacokinetics are not believed to have major impact  26 . Generally, older NSCLC patients who received chemotherapy had fewer previous chemotherapy events than younger patients and were less likely to receive platinum‐based regimens. Nevertheless, older patients (aged ≥75 years) had more adverse events during chemotherapy, independent of comorbidity  27 . This current study of NSCLC patients shows no age‐related differences in total docetaxel pharmacokinetic parameters, but higher incidence of grade 4 neutropenia in patients aged ≥75 years (Table  3 ) despite the number of prior treatments being fewer in older patients (Table  1 ). These results are consistent with other studies in various cancer patients treated with docetaxel  10 ,  11 . Ten Tije  et al. 
 10  and Hurria  et al. 
 11  reported no statistically significant age‐related differences in total docetaxel pharmacokinetics; however, older patients (aged ≥65 or 75 years) experienced severe haematological toxicity at doses of 75 mg m −2  once every 3 weeks or 35 mg m −2  weekly, respectively. Dosage of docetaxel in our study was 60 mg m −2  once every 3 weeks, which differed from the recommended dose of 75 mg m −2  for NSCLC in the US and Europe. There is still discrepancy in clinically feasible standard doses for NSCLC between Japan and other countries, as docetaxel was approved in Japan at a recommended dose of 60 mg m −2  once every 3 weeks based on the results of Japanese registration studies  28 ,  29 ,  30 . There are no racial and/or ethnic differences in docetaxel pharmacokinetics, but a marked difference has been observed in toxicities of docetaxel  31 . Unbound drugs are pharmacologically active because they can traverse cell membranes and distribute into tissues to bind their targets. It has been reported that exposure of unbound docetaxel is related to drug‐induced hematologic toxicity  15 ,  16 . We illustrated that percent decrease in ANC at nadir was related to  fu ·AUC (Figure  4 A). Interestingly, our results indicate unbound AUC ( fu ·AUC) of docetaxel was significantly higher in patients aged ≥75 years than in patients aged &lt;75 years (Table  3 ), suggesting severe neutropenia in older patients is attributable not only to high sensitivity as concluded in previous reports, but also high unbound AUC ( fu ·AUC). As serum AAG level is a determinant of CL (Table  S1 , Table  2 ), which inversely relates to AUC, as well as unbound fraction ( fu ; Figure  3 C), AAG levels determine  fu ·AUC and can predict docetaxel‐induced neutropenia for even older patients, with a wide degree of interindividual variability. Low baseline ANC patients are reportedly at an increased risk of developing grade 4 neutropenia. We also found ANC at baseline to be a significant factor affecting EC 50 , which in turn influenced the percent decrease in ANC induced by docetaxel ( Table S2 , Table  2  and Figure  4 A). Further, decreased ANC at baseline correlated with development of severe neutropenia (Figure  4 B). Indeed, in patients aged ≥75 years whose baseline ANC tended to be lower but not significantly compared with patients aged &lt;75 years (Table  1 ), the percentage of patients with grade 4 neutropenia was significantly higher (Table  3 ). Therefore, low ANC at baseline can predict severe neutropenia as it is described in the clinical practice guideline “Recommendations for the Use of WBC Growth Factors” by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) that pre‐existing neutropenia is one of the risk factors for febrile neutropenia  32 . The ASCO guideline also recommends primary prophylaxis with CSF for patients with risk factors of febrile neutropenia including those aged ≥65 years. Increasing risk and severity of toxicities with age can be explained in terms of declining bone marrow reserve  33 , dysregulated cellular proliferation, decreased ability to repair DNA, and reduced immune surveillance. Serum ALB levels are generally decreased in the elderly, whereas AAG levels are not altered by age  per se 
 34 . However, in cancer patients, serum AAG levels have been reported to be high and vary approximately five‐fold between individuals  35 . Indeed, serum AAG levels at baseline varied from 50 to 264 mg dl −1  (normal range; 39–98 mg dl −1 ), and consequent degree of unbound fraction was also widely distributed in 3.1–15.6% (Figure  3 A). In conclusion, this study indicates that serum level of AAG is a key determinant of docetaxel unbound exposure and related dose‐limiting toxicity regardless of ageing. Neutropenia can be predicted by serum AAG level and ANC at baseline for patients of all ages following the administration of docetaxel.

    <Abstact>The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is an highly conserved signal transduction axis involved in many cellular processes, such as cell growth, survival, transcription, translation, apoptosis, metabolism, motility and autophagy. Recently, this signalling pathway has come to the attention of the scientific community owing to the unexpected finding that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin, an antibiotic with immunosuppressant and chemotherapeutic properties, extends lifespan in diverse animal models. Moreover, rapamycin has been reported to rescue the cellular phenotype in a progeroid syndrome [Hutchinson–Gilford Progeria syndrome (HGPS)] that recapitulates most of the traits of physiological ageing. The promising perspectives raised by these results warrant a better understanding of mTOR signalling and the potential applications of mTOR inhibitors to counteract ageing‐associated diseases and increase longevity. This review is focused on these issues.</Abstact>
    <Body>Ageing and progeria‐related diseases Ageing is a physiological process aimed at the homeostasis of tissues through removal of cells bearing damaged genome sections or nonfunctional organelles. The advantage of ageing is that the neoplastic transformation of tissues and organs is avoided. The side effects of ageing include a loss of stem cells and a reduction in extracellular components, which are also associated with inflammatory processes contributing to tissue degeneration. The ageing traits are recapitulated in the majority of the so‐called premature ageing (progeroid) syndromes, which are genetic diseases of variable severity, with onset in childhood or in the teens, and are described briefly in this section. Of note, all of the known progeroid syndromes are caused by defects in proteins that regulate chromatin dynamics and genome stability, from lamins to ReqQ helicases up to proteins directly involved in DNA damage repair. The role of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and mTOR inhibitors in the affected pathways is discussed in the section on mTOR molecular pathways in ageing. LMNA‐linked progeroid syndromes Progeric laminopathies are syndromic diseases associated with defects of the nuclear lamina protein lamin A/C. They represent a paradigm of age‐related diseases as they encompass most of the disorders linked to normal ageing. Hutchinson–Gilford Progeria syndrome (HGPS) is caused by heterozygous mutations of the  LMNA  gene encoding lamin A and lamin C. Patients are healthy at birth but rapidly develop a senescent phenotype, starting at a few months of age, and are typically affected by ageing disorders, including hair loss, articular defects, skin atrophy and rigidity, atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease leading to premature death, in the first or second decade. The recurrent mutation in HGPS patients is the silent G608G  LMNA  mutation, which activates a cryptic splice site, triggering the production of a truncated and farnesylated precursor of lamin A called progerin. Progerin is toxic to cells and causes nuclear dysmorphism and a severe loss of heterochromatin  1 , mislocalization or loss of chromatin‐associated proteins such as the DNA‐bridging factor barrier‐to‐autointegration factor (BAF) and the DNA damage repair proteins poly(ADP‐ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) and p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1)  2 ,  3 ,  4 , and accumulation of irreparable DNA damage  5 . The same effects are observed in other progeroid syndromes featuring accumulation of farnesylated prelamin A, such as mandibuloacral dysplasia type A and B (MADA and MADB, respectively)  6 ,  7 ,  8 ,  9  and atypical Werner syndrome (A‐WS)  10 ,  11 . MADA is a rare disease characterized by growth retardation, bone resorption at specific sites (including the clavicles, phalanges and mandible), mottled cutaneous pigmentation, skin rigidity, partial lipodystrophy and insulin resistance. Patients develop premature ageing traits in the first or second decade. Similar clinical signs are also observed in A‐WS and atypical progeria syndrome (APS), owing to mutations in the lamin A/C rod domain; these conditions do not necessarily feature accumulation of prelamin A and their pathogenetic pathways are still unclear  12 . In all premature ageing syndromes caused by mutations in the  LMNA  gene, the central nervous system is spared, owing to physiological downregulation by microRNA‐9 controlling lamin A expression and its splicing isoform progerin in brain tissues  13 ,  14 . Cells from progeroid laminopathies are not only the best experimental model in which to test potential therapeutic approaches to these diseases, but also represent a powerful model for the study of the senescent phenotype associated with age‐related disorders. However, the involvement of lamin in mechanisms that favour longevity has been determined by studying cells and tissues from very old healthy subjects. In a recent study  15 , it was demonstrated that the lamin A precursor (prelamin A) plays a key role in healthy ageing, as a master regulator of the recruitment of nuclear factors implicated in genome stability. It has also been demonstrated that the nuclear envelope acts as a sensor of stress conditions and drives chromatin dynamics (heterochromatin decondensation, recruitment of 53BP1, rapid repair of damaged DNA) aimed at cell survival and genome maintenance  15 . Exacerbation of lamina remodelling as it occurs in progeroid laminopathies elicits the opposite, and deleterious, effects, mostly because of the accumulation of toxic prelamin A  4 ,  8 ,  16 . Thus, comparative analysis of lamin A and prelamin A role in normal and pathological ageing processes may give new and relevant insights into the understanding of ageing pathways, including those involving mTOR signalling and autophagy, as detailed below. Nucleotide excision repair (NER)‐linked progeroid syndromes Other diseases featuring premature ageing traits are associated with defects in the DNA repair machinery caused by mutations in genes encoding NER proteins. NER is a multistep mechanism able to identify and restore nucleotidic changes due to ultraviolet (UV) rays or chemical compounds, modifying DNA structure  17 . Mutations occurring to the proteins involved in this machinery are responsible for the onset of genetic disorders, and all feature in the development of cancers and increased sensitivity to light. Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder involving eight gene variants, all featuring an impaired ability to repair cellular DNA damaged by UV light exposure from the sun. The signs of XP usually appear in infancy or early childhood, when affected children develop severe sunburn after spending a few minutes in the sun. People with XP have a greatly increased risk of developing multiple  basal cell carcinomas  (basaliomas) and other skin malignancies on the face, lips and eyelids during their lifetime. Death occurs early, owing to metastatic malignant melanoma and  squamous cell carcinoma 
 18 . XP mutations can occur in the following genes: damage‐specific DNA binding protein 2 ( DDB2 ), DNA excision repair crosscomplementation group 2, ‐3, ‐4, ‐5 (ERCC2, ERCC3, ERCC4, ERCC5),  XPA  and  XP5 
 19 . The products of these genes are all involved in the DNA damage repair pathway, based on the NER mechanism. Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative progeroid pathology featuring clear premature ageing and severe light sensitivity  18 . It is characterized by growth failure, impaired development of the nervous system, photosensitivity, eye disorders and premature ageing. It is often associated with a group of disorders called leukodystrophies, which are conditions characterized by the degradation of neurological white matter. Two types of CS have been described and occur as a result of mutations of different genes. Type I CS occurs following mutations in the DNA excision repair crosscomplementation group gene 8 ( ERCC8 ), encoding the CS‐A protein. These mutations cause alternative splicing of the corresponding pre‐mRNA, leading to a nonfunctional protein  20 . Type II CS is caused by mutations in the  ERCC6  gene, encoding the CS‐B protein  21 . Trichothiodystrophy (TTD) is a rare autosomal recessive inherited disorder mostly characterized by brittle hair, due to a general sulfur deficiency, and by intellectual impairment  18 . Mild cases of TTD may involve only the hair. However, more severe cases may cause delayed development, significant intellectual disability and recurrent infections; severely affected individuals may survive only up to infancy or early childhood. Approximately half of all patients with TTD have photosensitivity, which divides the classification of the disease into syndromes with or without photosensitivity  22 ,  23 . In contrast to XP, patients affected by TTD do not show a higher risk of developing skin cancer. RecQ‐associated progeria‐related syndromes The family of RecQ proteins groups enzymes with ATP‐dependent helicase activity, required during the repair of damaged DNA to unwind the mutated double strand. Their actions prevent deleterious recombination and genomic instability  24 ; therefore, mutations in the corresponding genes are associated with an increased predisposition to cancer and ageing phenotypes. Bloom syndrome (BS) is a rare autosomal recessive progeroid syndrome characterized by a striking genomic instability associated with a high risk of cancer. Its most prominent features include short stature and a rash on all areas of the skin that are exposed to the sun, developed in early age. Other clinical features include a high‐pitched voice; distinct facial features, including a long, narrow face, micrognathia, and prominent nose and ears; and changes to skin pigmentation, including hypopigmented and hyperpigmented areas  25 . The genetic cause of BS is mutations in the RecQ2 gene, also known as the BLM gene, encoding the BS protein, which is one of the five RecQ DNA helicases identified so far. Two other RecQ‐linked genetic diseases are caused by defects in WRN and RecQ4 genes where WRN encodes for a protein responsible, when mutated for a progeroid syndrome: Werner's syndrome  26 . Werner's syndrome (WS) is a genetic disorder due to mutations in the WRN gene, which encodes a RecQ helicase called WRN protein. The clinical phenotype is almost identical to that observed in A‐WS syndrome linked to lamin A mutations  27 . Affected individuals can exhibit growth retardation, short stature and signs of premature ageing, such as premature greying and loss of hair, wrinkles, a beaked nose, skin atrophy, loss of fat tissues and atherosclerosis  28 . Interestingly, mutation of the WRN gene may cause a decrease in the stability of the corresponding mRNA. Mutations may also lead to the loss of the nuclear localization signal of the protein, leading to an aberrant accumulation of the WRN protein in the cytoplasm. RecQ4 mutations cause Rothmund–Thomson syndrome (RTS). RTS patients exhibit some premature ageing symptoms similar to those of WS, including skin hyperpigmentation and widened blood capillaries, known as poikiloderma. Moreover, similar to progeric laminopathies, RTS patients present abnormal bone turnover but, unlike those affected by these syndromes, are predisposed to osteosarcoma. DNA polymerase‐linked progeroid syndromes The variant form of XP, known as XP‐V, is caused by mutations in the POLH (DNA polymerase eta) gene, which encodes a DNA polymerase; its mutation leads to an overall increase in UV‐dependent DNA damage, which ultimately causes the symptoms of XP  19 . Finally, mutations in the DNA polymerase delta p125 catalytic subunit (POLD1) have been recently linked to a form of mandibuloacral dysplasia, the mandibular hypoplasia, deafness, progeroid features and lipodystrophy syndrome (MDPL), which, from the clinical point of view, is identical to that caused by  LMNA  mutations but also features sensorineural deafness  29 ,  30 . Human POLD1 modulates cell cycle progression and DNA damage repair  31 . POLH, also known as DNA polymerase η, is involved in translesion DNA synthesis in the UV‐induced DNA damage response and acts downstream of the WRN protein  32 . mTOR signalling mTOR pathway The mTOR pathway is a highly conserved signal transduction axis involved in many cellular processes, such as cell growth, survival, transcription, translation, apoptosis, metabolism, motility, autophagy and ageing  33 . This signalling pathway may be activated by various cellular stimuli, such as growth factors and cytokines, nutrients (e.g. glucose, amino acids) and inflammatory stimuli. Thus, considering the crucial role played by mTOR signalling in several physiological processes, it is evident that dysregulation of this cascade could have dramatic consequences. Indeed, it is well established that alterations in its activity are linked to the pathogenesis of a variety of human diseases, such as metabolic disorders (obesity and type 2 diabetes), cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, age‐related disorders and cancer. mTOR is a serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) kinase which belongs to the phosphoinositide kinase‐related family of protein kinases (PIKK)  34 . In response to these growth signals, mTOR regulates cell growth and proliferation positively by promoting many anabolic processes and limiting catabolic processes such as autophagy  35  (Figure  1 ). mTOR collects input from several signal transduction networks, such as the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3‐kinase (PI3K)/Akt and the Ras/Raf/mitogen‐activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal‐regulated kinase (ERK). Moreover, recent studies have highlighted that mTOR also responds to inputs via the WNT and liver kinase B1 (LKB1)/AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) signalling pathways  36 . AMPK functions as a key sensor of intracellular energy balance: under metabolic stress conditions, LKB1 activates AMPK, which in turn directly inhibits mTOR  37 . Figure 1 Cellular signalling upstream and downstream of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complexes. (A) mTOR pathways and functional relationships. mTOR forms two multiprotein complexes – mTOR complex (mTORC) 1 and mTORC2. The classical mTORC1‐positive inputs are growth factors, chemokines, nutrients and cell energy balance. Growth factors stimulate mTORC1 through the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3‐kinase (PI3K)/Akt signalling pathway. Akt phosphorylates tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2). TSC2 is a GTPase‐activating protein that functions in association with TSC1 to inactivate the small G protein Rheb, which, in turn, upregulates mTORC1 activity. mTORC1 activity is required for the phosphorylation and subsequent activation of ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), which regulates the elongation step of protein translation, ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B (eIF4B), ultimately promoting the initiation of translation and elongation. mTORC1 also phosphorylates and inactivates the translation inhibitor eIF4E‐binding protein 1 (4E‐BP1), which inhibits cap‐dependent translation. The mTOR pathway may be also regulated by the LKB1/AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. AMPK phosphorylates TSC2, activating the TSC1/TSC2 complex and thus repressing mTORC1 activity. Moreover, AMPK phosphorylates Raptor, inducing Raptor and mTORC1 disassembly/inhibition. mTORC2 regulates cell survival through serum‐ and glucocorticoid‐activated kinase 1 (SGK1) and Akt. mTORC2 phosphorylates Akt at Ser473, priming Akt for further phosphorylation by phosphoinositide‐dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) at the Thr308 residue. Loss of phosphorylation at the Ser473 site, however, affects only some Akt substrates, such as Forkhead Homeobox type O (FOXO) transcription factors, but not TSC2, in response to growth factor signalling. mTORC2 also associates with actively translating ribosomes to phosphorylate cotranslationally Akt (at Thr450), which prevents the ubiquitination and degradation of Akt. mTORC2 is involved in the spatial control of cell growth via cytoskeletal regulation. (B) mTOR and autophagy. Under nutrient‐rich conditions, mTOR associates with and inhibits the UNC51‐like kinase (ULK) complex by phosphorylating autophagy‐related (ATG) 13 and ULK1. By contrast, stress signals or AMPK activation lead to mTORC1 dissociation from ULK1 and to the activation of the ULK complex, thereby triggering the autophagy machinery. Arrows indicate activating events, whereas perpendicular lines indicate inhibitory events. FIP200, focal adhesion kinase family‐interacting protein of 200 kD; FKBP38, FK‐506‐binding protein; GPCR, G protein‐coupled receptor; IGF1‐R, insulin‐like growth factor 1 receptor; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; IRS1, insulin receptor substrate 1; LKB1, liver kinase B1; mLST8, mammalian lethal with sec‐13 protein 8; PI(3,4,5)‐P3, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)‐trisphosphate; PRAS40, proline‐rich Akt substrate of 40‐kDa; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homologue; SIN1, stress‐activated protein kinase‐interacting protein 1; VPS, vacuolar protein sorting mTOR is the catalytic subunit of two functionally and structurally distinct multiprotein complexes: mTOR complex (mTORC) 1 and mTORC2, both of which are characterized by their different partner proteins and their substrate specificity  34 . mTORC1 is composed of mTOR, the regulatory associated protein of mTOR (Raptor), mammalian lethal with sec‐13 protein 8 (mLST8), proline‐rich Akt substrate of 40‐kDa (PRAS40), FK‐506‐binding protein (FKBP) 38, and dep domain containing mTOR‐interacting protein (Deptor)  34 . The best known function of mTORC1 is the regulation of translation. It can phosphorylate components of the protein synthesis machinery, including p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and the translation inhibitor, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E‐binding protein 1 (4E‐BP1)  38 , leading to active translation of mRNAs involved in ribosome biogenesis  39 . mTORC2 comprises rapamycin‐insensitive companion of mTOR (Rictor), mLST8, stress‐activated protein kinase‐interacting protein 1 (SIN1), protein observed with Rictor (Protor) and Deptor, and is generally described as being insensitive to rapamycin/rapalogs. It is mainly activated by growth factors through PI3K/Akt, and controls several downstream AGC kinases such as Akt itself (phosphorylation on Ser473), serum‐ and glucocorticoid stimulated kinase (SGK) and protein kinase Cα (PKCα). It regulates cell proliferation but is also involved in the spatial control of cell growth via cytoskeleton regulation  40 . Recently, it has been demonstrated that mTORC1, via activation of ribosome biogenesis and inhibition of autophagy‐mediated ribosome turnover, indirectly controls mTORC2  41  (Figure  1 ). mTOR and autophagy Through the phosphorylation of other targets, mTORC1 triggers metabolic changes such as mitochondrial biogenesis, the promotion of glycolysis, lipid biogenesis and the suppression of autophagy  33 . Indeed, mTORC1 is a negative regulator of autophagy, a process required for the recycling of damaged organelles and for cellular adaptation to nutrient starvation, growth factor withdrawal and oxidative stress  35 . Once activated, the autophagic machinery sequesters cytoplasmic components and, fusing with lysosomes, leads to the degradation of cell components and recycling of cellular building blocks. mTORC1 transduces anti‐autophagic signals by binding to the UNC51‐like kinase (ULK) multiprotein complex, which is essential for the initial steps of autophagy. mTORC1 directly phosphorylates ULK1 (which may also be a target for Akt following insulin stimulation), which in turn may regulate autophagy independently from mTORC1 function  42 . Conversely, during nutrient deprivation or pharmacological mTORC1 inhibition, mTORC1 dissociates from the ULK1 complex, leading to active forms of ULK1. By contrast, AMPK is an important positive regulator of the autophagic machinery. Under metabolic stress conditions, LKB1 activates AMPK, which directly phosphorylates ULK1 at multiple sites, thus upregulating ULK1 activity, and activates tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2), an indirect inhibitor of mTORC1 activity  43 . Following mTORC1 inhibition, derepressed ULK1, by binding to ATG14L (ATG ‐Autophagy related‐14 Like), is recruited to a molecular platform composed of vacuolar protein sorting 34 (Vps34) and beclin‐1. This leads to the phosphorylation of beclin‐1 on Ser 14, and activation of Vps34. VPS34 is the only class III PI3K member and plays an important role in regulating membrane trafficking and autophagy, releasing PI 3‐phosphate at the nascent autophagosome, the phagophore  44 . In this condition, microtubule‐associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), a structural protein found in the cytoplasm in its precursor form (LC3I) is cleaved, lipidated (i.e. coupled to  phosphatidylethanolamine ) and converted into its active autophagosomal, membrane‐bound form, LC3II  45 . Potential therapeutic effects of mTOR inhibitors Considering the numerous functions played by mTORC1 and mTORC2 in several physiological processes, it is evident that dysregulation of this axis could have important negative effects. Indeed, upregulation of mTOR signalling has been found to be involved in the onset and progression of many human diseases, and mTOR is therefore regarded as a key target for innovative therapeutic strategies. In fact, several mTOR inhibitors have been released by pharmaceutical companies. Three classes of mTOR inhibitors have been developed: rapamycin/rapalogs that are allosteric mTORC1 inhibitors; ATP‐competitive, ‘active‐site’ mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitors that target the catalytic site of mTOR; and dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors that target both PI3K and mTORC1/mTORC2 (Figure  2 ). Figure 2 Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors. mTORC1 inhibitors are allosteric inhibitors that lead to the dissociation of Raptor from mTOR complex (mTORC) 1 and loss of contact between mTORC1 and its substrates. Dual phosphatidylinositol 3‐kinase PI3K/mTOR inhibitors target both PI3K and mTORC1/mTORC2, acting on the catalytic sites of PI3K and mTOR. mTORC1/mTORC2‐selective inhibitors target the catalytic site of the enzyme, thus acting on both mTORC1 and mTORC2. AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator has a negative effect on mTORC1. Arrows indicate activating events; perpendicular lines indicate inhibitory events. FKBP38, FK‐506‐binding protein; mLST8, mammalian lethal with sec‐13 protein 8; PRAS40, proline‐rich Akt substrate of 40‐kDa Rapamycin Rapamycin (also known as sirolimus) is a natural compound produced by the bacterium  Streptomyces hygroscopicus  that acts as an allosteric mTORC1 inhibitor  46 . It forms a gain‐of‐function complex with 12‐kDa FKBP12, which binds to the FKBP12/rapamycin‐binding (FRB) domain of mTOR only when mTOR is associated with other components of mTORC1. This complex leads to the dissociation of Raptor and loss of contact between mTORC1 and its substrates  47 . Therefore, rapamycin does not directly target the mTOR catalytic site and does not affect mTORC2 activity, although it has been demonstrated that long‐term exposure can also affect mTORC2 assembly  48 ,  49 . The discovery of rapamycin immediately raised great interest in the scientific community for its numerous proprieties, e.g. as a powerful antibiotic, antiproliferative and immunosuppressant  50 . In 1991, rapamycin was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the prophylaxis of renal transplant rejection  51  and as a chemotherapeutic agent against renal carcinoma. Moreover, rapamycin has been used to inhibit restenosis after the implantation of stents during coronary angioplasty  52 ,  53 , and it entered numerous clinical trials for conditions such as lymphangioleiomyomatosis  54  and tuberous sclerosis. Rapalogs The limitations in the solubility and pharmacokinetic properties of rapamycin led to the commercial development of new mTOR inhibitors, such as semi‐synthetic rapamycin analogues, named rapalogs or active site inhibitors. Rapalogs have an improved bioavailability when compared with rapamycin, and include CCI‐779 (temsirolimus or torisel), RAD001 (everolimus) and AP23573 (ridaforolimus), which have been, and continue to be, tested in a wide range of clinical trials for numerous chronic disease indications. CCI‐779 is a rapamycin ester derivative that was approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced‐stage renal cell carcinoma in 2007. In Europe, it is also approved for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma  55 . Unfortunately, in patients affected by advanced renal cell carcinoma, CCI‐779 has strong side effects, including hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia, anaemia, peripheral oedema and dermatological adverse events  56 . RAD001 is another rapamycin analogue that has been approved by the FDA for patients affected by various malignancies, including renal cell carcinoma  57 , subependymal giant cell astrocytoma  58  and progressive neuroendocrine tumours of pancreatic origin  59 . The orally available RAD001 is more efficacious than rapamycin as it has a higher affinity for FKBP12  60 . More recently, two other classes of mTOR inhibitors, which target the catalytic site of mTOR, have been developed to overcome the side effects of rapalog ‘active‐site’ mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitors. PI3K and mTOR belong to the PIKK family of kinases, and share high sequence homology in their catalytic domains. Dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors target the active sites of both the PI3K and mTOR, inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway both upstream and downstream of Akt, thus avoiding the Akt activation following abolition of the mTORC1/S6K1/insulin receptor substrate 1 negative feedback loop, which is known to occur with rapalogs  61 . The first compound of this class to be produced was the morpholinoquinazoline derivative PI‐103  62 . To reduce toxicity due to the use of these inhibitors, efforts were undertaken to design a new‐generation mTOR inhibitor (mTORC1/mTORC2‐selective inhibitor) that competes with ATP for binding to the kinase domain of mTOR, thus having a specific blocking effect on its kinase activity. In the same manner as with dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, acting on both mTOR complexes, mTORC1/mTORC2‐selective inhibitors display stronger effects than rapalogs in the treatment of a wide variety of cancers, and they might offer an efficient alternative to rapalogs. Their use also minimizes the reactivation feedback loops of Akt that are seen with rapalogs. The prototype of this class of drugs is PP242  63 . Recently, novel compounds that target mTOR indirectly are attracting attention for their better safety profiles, such as resveratrol (3,4′,5‐trihydroxy‐trans‐stilbene) and metformin (N,N‐dimethylbiguanide). Resveratrol Resveratrol is a natural polyphenol that shows numerous beneficial effects, acting as an antioxidant, anti‐inflammatory and anticancer drug. Moreover, it seems to have protective effects against a number of cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases  64 . It has been reported that resveratrol can inhibit mTORC1 by blocking the interaction between Deptor and mTOR  65 . Metformin Metformin belongs to the biguanide class of oral hypoglycaemic agents, which has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of type 2 diabetes since 1995. Intriguingly, metformin treatment has also been associated with a reduced risk of cancer  66  and of cardiovascular diseases  67 . There is a growing body of evidence that metformin inhibits mTORC1 through a different mechanism, by activating AMPK. AMPK, in turn, blocks mTORC1  68  regulating it through Ras‐related GTP binding (Rag) GTPases  69  and indirectly activating regulated in development and DNA damage responses 1 (REDD1), a mTOR inhibitor that promotes TSC2 activity  70 . mTOR molecular pathways in ageing Several processes downstream of mTOR signalling contribute to ageing, including the regulation of protein translation, autophagy, stem cell pool homeostasis, inflammation and cellular senescence (Figure  3 ). Figure 3 The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex (mTORC1) signalling pathway contributes to ageing through various cellular processes. Active mTORC1 activates stem cell turnover, cellular senescence and protein translation (arrows), while it inhibits autophagy. These conditions contribute to the ageing of an organism. See text for details. FKBP38, FK‐506‐binding protein; mLST8, mammalian lethal with sec‐13 protein 8; PRAS40, proline‐rich Akt substrate of 40‐kDa Protein translation The inhibition of mTORC1‐dependent translation may extend lifespan by reducing the burden on the protein‐folding machinery, leading to improved protein quality. Reduced translation via knockout of S6K1 extends longevity and blocks the onset of age‐related pathologies  71 . Moreover, genetic depletion of ribosomal proteins, as well as inhibition of translation initiation factors, can similarly extend lifespan in yeast and worms  72 ,  73 . Autophagy Ageing is characterized by the accumulation of unprocessed material and by the decrease in autophagy. The anti‐ageing effects of rapamycin are also dependent on the induction of this catabolic mechanism in yeast, worms and flies  74 ,  75 ,  76 . For instance, in  Caenorhabditis elegans , a loss‐of‐function mutation in the insulin‐like growth factor (IGF) pathway causes autophagy, whereas inhibition of autophagy by mutation of essential Atg genes prevents the acquisition of longevity  77 . Stem cell pool turnover mTORC1 is a key regulator of growth signals that drives the exit of tissue stem cells from quiescence. Stem cell activation contributes to tissue turnover but affects the stem cell pool, progressively eliciting stem cell niche depletion. Thus, rapamycin represents a tool for preserving the stem cell pool and, as a consequence, the functionality of tissues and organs over time. In support of this, six weeks of treatment with rapamycin in elderly mice improved the regenerative capacity of haematopoietic stem cells  78 . Regulation of the inflammatory response Recent exciting advances in the study of the well‐defined mechanism of inflammaging  79  have suggested that tissue damage or stress trigger a specific secretory phenotype, starting from interleukin (IL) 1α production and nuclear factor‐kB activation  80 . The environment elicited by cellular damage corresponds to a senescence‐associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and, unexpectedly, favours tissue repair and cellular senescence as a side effect  80 ,  81 ,  82 . Cytokines produced during the inflammatory response signal through mTOR (Figure  3 ) either by activating PI3K, which targets mTORC2 complex, or by stimulating the p38/Erk pathway to activate mTORC1  83  Downstream of these biochemical pathways, cellular proinflammatory cytokines are mostly inhibited but ageing‐related molecules such as IL6 are activated  83 . Thus, modulation of mTOR activity can affect inflammaging positively or negatively. It has been shown that rapamycin inhibits the expression of tumour necrosis factor and IL‐6, two main players in the ageing‐associated inflammatory response  83 . Cellular senescence The mTOR pathway also drives cellular senescence  84 , a cellular decline that follows development and maturation, characterized by loss of capacity to replicate without undergoing apoptosis and by a proinflammatory secretory phenotype (SASP)  85 . In proliferating cells, mTOR drives cellular proliferation through activation of protein translation and modulation of nutrient sensing and the cellular response. Under stress conditions, the cyclin‐dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is upregulated to trigger cell cycle arrest and allow damage repair. In this context, mTOR contributes to converting irreversible cell cycle arrest to cellular senescence, an event referred to as geroconversion  86 ,  87 . Geroconversion is a form of futile growth that occurs during cell cycle arrest. It leads to hypersecretory and hypertrophic cellular phenotypes and the activation of a specific inflammatory response, as also detailed above (Figure  3 ). In both human and rat cells, geroconversion  84  is suppressed by rapamycin and other rapalogs, maintaining cellular quiescence  88 ,  89 . Recently, it has been demonstrated that low doses of dual mTORC1/mTORC2‐selective inhibitors (PP242 and Torin1) can also constrain cellular senescence  87 . mTOR inhibition to counteract ageing There is an increasing interest in genetic and pharmacological mTOR inhibition aimed at extending longevity and improving the healthy lifespan. The effects of mTOR inhibition in slowing down the ageing process have been demonstrated over the years in many animal models. Initial experimental data showed that reduced TOR activity in yeast, worms and flies may be sufficient to delay ageing  74 ,  90 ,  91 . Recent evidences suggested that mTOR plays the same important role in regulating lifespan in mammals. Indeed, Selman and colleagues demonstrated that deletion of S6K1 extends the median lifespan of mice and counteracts the onset of age‐related pathologies, such as bone, immune and motor dysfunction, as well as loss of insulin sensitivity  71 . The effect on lifespan extension was also demonstrated in mice bearing heterozygous deletions of mTOR and mLST8, corroborating this hypothesis  49 . Moreover, Wu and colleagues recently showed that, in a mTOR hypomorphic mouse model, there was an increase in median lifespan, associated with a reduction in the age‐dependent decline in tissue and organ functionality  92 . The specific effects of mTOR on lifespan have also been confirmed concurrently by pharmacological inhibitors. Rapamycin was the first mTOR inhibitor to be tested in mice, and was found to extend both mean and maximum lifespan  93 . In recent years, the National Institute of Ageing (NIA) Intervention Testing Program (ITP) embarked on a phase II study to test the possible clinical translational potential of rapamycin to delay ageing, and thus to extend the healthy lifespan in mice. Indeed, mTOR inhibition seems to be an innovative strategy for the treatment of a wide range of age‐associated conditions and diseases. The effects of rapamycin on lifespan extension have been reported when treatment is begun late in mouse life, at 20 months of age, in both genders  93 . Slightly larger effects have been observed when the drug is administrated to young mice  94 . Rapamycin's efficacy in mice has been also confirmed starting at four months of age and continued throughout life  95 . It is interesting that rapamycin‐treated mice live three to four months longer (the equivalent of ten human years), with the same quality of life at the time of death, than mice that do not receive the drug  96 . Importantly, rapamycin delayed different hallmarks of ageing in mice, including cardiac hypertrophy, liver degeneration, and a decline in adrenal gland and endometrial function and tendon elasticity  97 . Various independent groups have reported that rapamycin also affects cognitive performance. Neff  et al . revealed that learning and memory were improved after rapamycin treatment  98 , while other independent groups found that rapamycin enhanced cognitive function in young adult mice and blocked age‐associated cognitive decline in older animals  99 ,  100 . In addition, in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), rapamycin was able to delay the onset of the neurodegenerative disease, restoring memory  101 ,  102 ,  103 . In spite of the initial encouraging results on the anti‐ageing therapeutic potential of resveratrol in mice and primates  104 ,  105 , recent studies have shown that this drug does not affect lifespan or longevity in male or female mice  94 , or in a cohort of more than 800 people over the age of 65 years  106 . Moreover, the use of resveratrol in progeric mice carrying an  LMNA  mutation did not improve the senescent phenotype  107 . With regard to metformin, evidence has shown that it extends healthy lifespan in worms  104 , rats  108  and mice  105 ,  109 ,  110 . In a promising NIA ITP study, long‐term treatment with low‐dose metformin in male mice, starting in middle age, showed a substantial extension of healthy lifespan and longevity  110 . Interestingly, a long‐term study in human patients, including the UK Prospective Diabetes Study, found that the treatment of diabetic patients with metformin reduced mortality from all causes, including diabetes‐related mortality, cancer and myocardial infarction  111 ,  112 . All of these results are hopeful, given that metformin has been already demonstrated to be safe and effective in humans, and, thus, may represent a novel strategy to delay ageing and counteract age‐related diseases. In mice, calorie restriction (CR) may counteract the onset of age‐related diseases such as stroke, diabetes, cancers, AD and Parkinson's disease (PD)  113 . Clinical studies have also been carried out in humans, with promising results, showing that CR is linked to a decreased risk of cancer, diabetes and overall mortality  113 . The positive effects of CR are attained, at least in part, through downregulation of the mTOR signalling pathway in yeast  114 , worms and mice  115 . Thus, mTOR inhibition by rapamycin or its analogues may mimic CR and counteract ageing processes. mTOR inhibitors and progeria‐related disorders Regulation of autophagy and protein accumulation The importance of mTOR in ageing and age‐related diseases is mostly related to its function as a master regulator of autophagy. Increased basal autophagic activity has been reported in progeroid laminopathies  8 ,  116  and WS cells  117 . Interestingly, as shown in Figure  4 , increased autophagy observed in HGPS fibroblasts is coupled to a reduction in mTOR activity. Besides being related to alterations in mTOR signalling, the increased autophagy observed in progeria cells is also a response to the cellular accumulation of misfolded and/or aggregated proteins, typical of these cells  118 . Although it is not an aspect common to all the progeroid syndromes studied so far, the mutated proteins responsible for the onset of the pathology, may be themselves targets of autophagic degradation. This has been demonstrated in MADA, for example, in which autophagy contributes, in part, to prelamin A degradation, thus reducing protein toxicity  8 . However, progerin, the toxic prelamin A form that accumulates in HGPS, is minimally affected by the autophagic process under basal conditions  116 ,  119 . Figure 4 Undetectable mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity in Hutchinson–Gilford Progeria syndrome (HGPS) fibroblasts. HGPS fibroblasts at passage 20 were cultured and lysed, as described by Cenni  et al 
 116 . Immunoblotting was performed with the following antibodies: progerin (Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. Farmingdale, NY, USA.), phospho‐mTOR [P‐mTOR (Ser2448)], mTOR and microtubule‐associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), respectively [#2971, #2972 and #4108 (Cell Signaling Technology Inc. Danvers, MA, USA)]. Lamin A/C (#6215, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Dallas, TX, USA), β‐tubulin and flag (both from Sigma‐Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA). The immunoblotted band between lamin A and lamin C bands corresponds to progerin In many age‐related diseases, protein aggregate formation is a hallmark of the mutated cellular phenotype. Aside from the afore‐mentioned progeroid cells, neurodegenerative pathologies also show a clear accumulation of aggregates and highly insoluble structures both inside the cells and in the extracellular matrix, negatively affecting the regulation of the nervous connections  120 . In AD, these aggregates consist of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, and of extracellular plaques containing abnormally folded amyloid‐beta (Aβ) aggregates. Aβ is a short peptide obtained at the end of the pathological processing of the amyloid precursor protein, whose function is unclear but is thought to be involved in neuronal development. Aβ oligomers and plaques act by blocking proteasome function, inhibiting mitochondrial activity, altering intracellular calcium levels and stimulating inflammatory processes. Aβ also interacts with the signalling pathways that regulate the phosphorylation of the microtubule‐associated protein tau, which, in normal conditions, regulates axonal transport. Hyperphosphorylation of tau disrupts its normal function and leads to the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles and toxic species of soluble tau. In addition, the degradation of hyperphosphorylated tau by the proteasome is inhibited by the actions of Aβ  121 . In PD, the aggregates consist of α‐synuclein fibrils, which assemble to form lethal Lewy bodies in the nerve cells. In normal conditions, α‐synuclein is found mainly in the presynaptic terminals of neurones, where it regulates the neuronal Golgi apparatus and vesicle trafficking  122 . Finally, in Huntington's disease (HD), toxic aggregates of mutated huntingtin (mHtt) are formed (see below). Wild‐type huntingtin is associated primarily with vesicles and microtubules, and is also involved in the upregulation of the expression of brain‐derived neurotrophic factor  123 ,  124 . mTOR inhibitors and lamin A/C‐dependent progeroid syndromes: HGPS and MADA Our group has proved that, by promoting autophagy, rapamycin has a powerful negative effect on the expression level of progerin and farnesylated forms of prelamin A in both HGPS  4 ,  116 ,  119  and MADA cells  8 . In 2011, we described that, by promoting the autophagic clearance of progerin and prelamin A, rapamycin treatment of HGPS fibroblasts rescues their chromatin phenotype, including histone methylation status and nuclear envelope protein distribution patterns  116 . Importantly, rapamycin treatment did not affect lamin C protein levels but increased the relative expression of ZMPSTE24 (Zinc Metalloproteinase 24), which is the endoprotease involved in prelamin A maturation, suggesting that not only prelamin A degradation, but also prelamin A processing may be enhanced by drug treatment  116 . Further, the results from Collins's laboratory showed that, by reducing progerin accumulation, the treatment of progeric cells with rapamycin reverses cellular phenotypes, such as nuclear blebbing, and delays the onset of cellular senescence  119 . Very recently, we demonstrated that all‐trans retinoic acid is synergistic with low‐dose rapamycin in reducing progerin accumulation in HGPS fibroblasts  4 . This effect is obtained through transcriptional downregulation of  LMNA  and by mutated protein degradation, and elicits an improvement in heterochromatin organization and the DNA damage response, ultimately ameliorating cell cycle dynamics. These data are very promising, particularly because the low doses of the drugs required for this combined treatment avoid the potential side effects associated with chronic treatment. Nuclear lamina turnover and protein modifications, e.g. occurring at cell division or during cellular differentiation, are mediated by several protein kinases that selectively lamin A/C and lamin B  125 . For example, lamin A phosphorylation sites have been identified and related to myogenic differentiation  126 . In addition, we have also reported that lamin A/C and nonfarnesylated prelamin A are phosphorylated by Akt1 at Ser404. This leads to lamin association to 14.3.3 proteins which is an event required for lamin A proteosomal degradation  127 ,  128 ,  129 . Intriguingly, these mechanisms also affect prelamin A stability, both under physiological conditions and in premature ageing syndromes. For instance, mutated prelamin A accumulates in MADA cells, and prelamin A levels increase  in vitro  with the number of passages in culture and  in vivo  with the age of the patients, contributing to a worsening of the disease  6 . Two forms of prelamin A accumulate in MADA cells  7 . However, while nonfarnesylated prelamin A is, in part, degraded through autophagy, farnesylated prelamin A accumulates to toxic levels. This is because nonfarnesylated prelamin A is highly phosphorylated at Ser404, while the farnesylated form of the lamin A precursor is not, suggesting the existence of an objective hindrance to its lysosomal clearance  8 . Nevertheless, in 2014, we demonstrated that the treatment of cultured MADA fibroblasts with rapamycin triggered the autophagic degradation of farnesylated prelamin A efficiently and selectively. The treatment of progeroid cells with rapamycin elicited the recovery of several cellular parameters [8]. In particular, rapamycin treatment of MADA cells, which feature very low levels of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide‐dependent sirtuin 1 (SIRT‐1) in the nuclear matrix, reduced soluble SIRT‐1 levels, to the benefit of the insoluble matrix‐bound protein. Recovery of SIRT‐1 binding to the nuclear matrix is expected to improve enzyme activity and to be relevant to metabolic processes governed by SIRT‐1  130 . Rapamycin treatment also led to the recovery of heterochromatin organization, as seen by the recovery of trimethylated Lysine (K) 9 on Histone 3, (usually indicated as trimethyl H3K9) distribution patterns and levels  8 . The latter is a key objective of laminopathy treatment as heterochromatin loss and disorganization are a major feature of laminopathic cells  1 ,  4 ,  6 ,  131 . Farnesylated prelamin A accumulation observed in MADA cells is also responsible for the recruitment of the stress‐induced transcription factor Oct‐1 at the nuclear lamina. As a consequence of its sequestration, Oct‐1 activity is impaired. By reducing farnesylated prelamin accumulation, rapamycin administration was seen to elicit the release of Oct‐1, restoring its transcriptional activity. Finally, rapamycin treatment of MADA fibroblasts partially rescued cell cycle dynamics. In fact, although the doubling time of MADA fibroblasts was not significantly changed by rapamycin, a significant proportion of cells re‐entered the cell cycle following drug treatment, and the S‐phase length was restored  8 . We recently reported on the efficacy of rapamycin treatment in rescuing cell type‐specific defects associated with  LMNA ‐linked progeroid syndromes. In osteoblast‐like U2OS cells overexpressing a mutant form of lamin A found in MADA (LA‐R527H), osteoclast differentiation markers were affected  9 . According to our evidence, this may have been due to the positive effect of the LA‐R527H mutant on the secretion of transforming growth factor‐β2, which, in turn, triggers osteoclastogenesis, an effect previously reported in primary MADA osteoblasts  132 . A reduction in mutated prelamin A levels by rapamycin treatment reduced aberrant osteoclastogenesis  9 . Thus, mTOR inhibitors may prove useful in the rescue of bone loss that affects MADA patients. mTOR inhibitors and other progeria‐related disorders As already stated, progeric laminopathies represent a paradigm of age‐related diseases as they summarize most of the disorders linked to normal ageing. Nonetheless, a number of pathologies feature some aspects of physiological ageing. A list of progeria‐related disorders for which mTOR inhibitor administration has been evaluated is presented below. Recent findings have proven that the mTOR pathway is altered in cells from nevi and melanoma from XP patients with defective DNA repair. Masaki  et al .  133  revealed that these cancerous cells have a very high frequency of UV‐type mutations in the phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) tumour suppressor gene. PTEN is a phosphatase that removes 3′‐phosphate from PI(3,4,5)‐trisphosphate to yield PI(4,5)‐bisphosphate, thus switching off the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway. XP‐induced mutation in the PTEN gene results in a loss of the protein activity, leading to a constitutive PI3K/Akt/mTOR cascade activation. The administration of PTEN/mTOR inhibitors in patients with these lesions may therefore offer an opportunity to prevent the development of melanoma  133 ,  134 . It should be noted, however, that Populo and colleagues describe the therapeutic inhibition of mTOR to induce cell death and prevent the progression of melanomas, rather than to induce autophagy. trisphosphate [134]. Recent studies indicated that Cockayne's Syndrome group B protein, CSB, a protein involved in the DNA repair machinery that is mutated in CS, is enriched in the mitochondria. This suggests a role for CSB in mitochondrial DNA repair  135 ,  136  following oxidative stress. In CS cells, the lack of CSB leads to an increase in the release of reactive oxygen species, coupled with mitochondrial dysfunction and increased metabolism. In these cells, another effect of the impairment of autophagic processes, is a defective mithocondrial turnover. Scheibye‐Knudsen  et al . demonstrated that, by promoting autophagy, rapamycin was able to promote mitochondrial turnover, rescuing the bioenergetic profile  137 . Talaei and colleagues have that fibroblasts from WS patients show a strong activation of the mTOR pathway, in spite of their high level of basal autophagy  117 . This has been demonstrated by an increase in mTOR activity, as well as in S6K1  117 . What is more, according to Talaei  et al ., the simultaneous activation of these pathways in WS cells may result in a signal that overrides suppression of autophagy by mTOR  117 . Recent studies have found that WS cells also exhibit low levels of intracellular thiol groups, which are known to be antioxidants. This is probably responsible for the highly vulnerability of WS cells to hydrogen peroxide treatment, UV radiation and cytostatic drugs  138 . Thiol groups, which are increased in sodium hydrosulfide treatment, were found to attenuate hydrogen peroxide‐induced DNA fragmentation in WS cells, suggesting a beneficial effect at the DNA level. In addition, sodium hydrosulfide treatment was also found to be responsible for an intense repression of the mTOR pathway  117 . Although the molecular mechanism is still obscure, the inhibition of the mTOR pathway by thiol groups produces the same beneficial effects as rapamycin treatment – i.e. a decrease in the level of insoluble proteins and in the percentage of aggregates, a restored nuclear morphology and a normalized phenotype of WS cells  117 . Unfortunately, published data on possible alterations of the mTOR pathway, increased autophagy and the use of rapalogs as treatment for TTD or BS are still missing. As stated above, these progeroid syndromes are associated with deficiencies in DNA repair mechanisms that lead to highly damaged DNA, which is ultimately responsible for a high vulnerability to stress. At present, scientists believe that increasing the efficiency of DNA repair might be associated with an extended healthy lifespan  139 ,  140 . In this context, mTOR inhibitors may not be useful as it has been reported that, by inhibiting p21 activity, they suppress the repair mechanisms [86]. mTOR inhibitors and other ageing‐related diseases Mouse models of AD show increased activity of mTOR and its downstream kinases. This leads to an abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau, the accumulation of which is toxic to cells. Nevertheless, recent findings support a role for Aβ aggregates as positive regulators of mTOR activity  101 . By activating autophagy, the treatment of AD mice with rapamycin has been reported to reduce Aβ protein levels and reverse cognitive deficits  102 ,  141 . Thus, mTOR inhibitors may represent a promising therapy for AD by reducing the hyperphosphorylation of tau, decreasing Aβ levels, and inducing autophagy  141 . Pathological protein deposits of α‐synuclein, Aβ and tau proteins can also be found in cells from patients with PD. This degenerative disorder also features the death of specific populations of cells, such as dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra. According to recent theories, oxidative stress plays an important role in the evolution of some forms of PD, as the increase in oxidative stress precedes the signs of neuronal degeneration. Toxin accumulation and oxidative stress in PD are likely to be responsible for the activation of RTP801, a stress response protein that drives neuronal cell death by leading to the inactivation of the survival kinase Akt. Published evidence obtained from cell cultures and  in vivo  PD models suggests that the treatment of PD patients with rapamycin regulates RTP801expression negatively by reducing its stability, thereby protecting the brain against neuronal death  142 . Dopaminergic cell death in PD has been hypothesized also to be related to oxidative stress‐induced accumulation of nonfunctioning autophagosomes. By inducing autophagy, rapamycin was shown to restore lysosome levels and autophagosome clearance, attenuating dopaminergic cell death in both  in vitro  and  in vivo  models of PD  143 . Moreover, rapamycin treatment has also been shown to counteract the accumulation of α‐synuclein aggregates in a mouse model of PD  144 . In HD, nerve cells appear full of aggregates made up of portions of mHtt, which is the product of HTT gene  145 . The severity of this neurodegenerative disorder is related to the number of polyglutamine (polyQ) repeats generated by pathological HTT mutation. Accumulation of mHtt is highly toxic and is associated with neuronal death. In mouse models and in the brains of humans with HD, mTOR has been shown to be sequestered in polyQ aggregates. mTOR inhibitors can enhance autophagy and consequently reduce mutated‐huntingtin (mHtt) accumulation and neuronal death in cellular and animal models of HD  146 ,  147 . Furthermore, it has been reported that rapamycin treatment can improve motor deficits in mouse models of HD  146 . On the whole, the administration of chemical compounds that act by inhibiting the mTOR pathway has led to excellent and promising results, as seen in primary cultures obtained from patients affected by progeria‐related syndromes and in cellular models reproducing these pathologies. However, it should be noted that, probably due to its immunosuppressant properties, the long‐term use of rapamycin is sometimes associated with many side effects (e.g. interstitial pneumonia, high levels of triglycerides, reduced wound healing and anaemia) which might also increase the risk of cancer and preclude its chronic use in age‐related diseases  148 . As the use of rapamycin monotherapy in a broad spectrum of diseases, especially in treating cancers, is limited due to its poor efficacy, it would be reasonable for rapamycin treatment of age‐related diseases to be combined with other compounds. Perspectives Several mTOR‐dependent processes are likely to contribute to the effects of mTORC1 inhibitors on ageing and diseases associated with premature ageing. Among those processes, activation of autophagy leading to the degradation of damaged organelles and misfolded or toxic proteins, as occurs in rapamycin‐treated cells from progeroid laminopathies, plays a beneficial role in counteracting cellular senescence. In this context, mTOR inhibition mimics and overcomes CR and its role in extending the lifespan. Moreover, hyperactivation of mTOR may be associated with inflammation, and mTOR inhibitors have anti‐inflammatory effects  81 ,  82 . Thus, reduction of age‐associated inflammation  149  is another possible mechanism by which mTORC1 inhibition could slow ageing‐related pathologies in humans. However, a key issue is avoiding uncontrolled effects due to improper dosage of rapamycin or its analogues. The proposed combination with other drugs, such as retinoic acid or oxidative stress inhibitors, acting in synergy with mTOR inhibitors to activate longevity pathways is a promising perspective.

    <Body>What is already known about this subject 
 Animal data suggest dipeptidyl peptidase‐IV as a promising target to prevent maladaptive remodelling after myocardial infarction. Gliptins inhibiting dipeptidyl peptidase‐IV have become of great interest for the treatment of diabetes mellitus type II, but are only available as oral formulations. A subcutaneous formulation could overcome the limitation of reduced bioavailability and provide stable dipeptidyl peptidase‐IV inhibition over time. 
 What this study adds 
 Escalating doses of subcutaneously administered dutogliptin overall showed a very good safety profile in healthy male subjects. Subcutaneous administration of dutogliptin resulted in approximately 100% bioavailability and translated into dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibition &gt;86% over 24 hours in subjects receiving 120 mg dutogliptin. This study provides promising pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of parenterally administered dutogliptin, warranting further evaluation in a clinical efficacy trial in patients after myocardial infarction to translate results from animal models into humans. 
 1 INTRODUCTION Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. 1 ,  2  Coronary heart disease accounts for almost 900 000 deaths in Europe annually. 2  In survivors, impaired heart function frequently causes long‐term disability. In this context, the process of cardiac remodelling is crucial; this is characterized by structural maladaptation of the heart following neurohumoral activation. 3 
 However, despite optimal care in accordance with current guidelines, coronary artery disease is still the most common factor in the development of heart failure as a long‐term complication. 4  Every fifth patient develops maladaptive left ventricular remodelling after myocardial infarction. 5 ,  6  Much effort has therefore been put into defining new targets to positively influence postinfarction cardiac remodelling. The stromal cell‐derived factor  https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=71  axis constitutes a promising target. 7  This humoral axis is crucial for stem cell homing, cardiac myocyte survival and therefore ventricular remodelling. 8  The rationale of reinforcing the key SDF‐1/CXCR4 axis has been proven effective in several preclinical studies. However, endogenous molecular signals of stem cell‐based repair are short‐lived and therefore clinically inefficient. 9  Besides genetic therapies, including engineered cell‐based and plasmid‐based overexpression of SDF‐1, 10 ,  11 
 https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=1612 ) inhibition has been shown to positively affect cardiac remodelling in mice. 12 ,  13 ,  14 ,  15 ,  16  This is not only related to benefits in ventricular remodelling with improved cardiac function, but also to atrial remodelling, preventing subsequent atrial fibrillation. 17 
 As DPP‐IV is an important cleaving enzyme for SDF‐1, reduced DPP‐IV activity leads to an increase in SDF‐1 levels. The combination of DPP‐IV inhibitors with granulocyte‐colony stimulating factor (G‐CSF) significantly increased homing of circulating stem cells, reduced cardiac remodelling and improved heart function as well as survival. 12 ,  18 
 Functions of DPP‐IV are various, and include involvement in immunology and inflammation, cancer, neuroendocrinology and glucose metabolism. The exact mechanism, how DPP‐IV inhibition may influence cardiac remodelling is still a matter of debate. In this context, DPP‐IV inhibition may provide beneficial effects on hyperoxidative stress, 13  restoration of angiogenesis and tissue repair 16  or an improved autophagic response. 15 
 Data from clinical use of DPP‐IV inhibitors mainly come from its use as therapy in type II diabetes mellitus. 19 ,  20 ,  21  In this respect, DPP‐IV inactivates several peptides involved in glucose metabolism, including glucagon‐like peptide 1, glucagon‐dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, vasoactive intestinal peptide and pituitary adenylate cyclase‐activating polypeptide, but also SDF‐1. 22 ,  23 
 Oral formulations of gliptines have been shown to effectively improve glycaemic control with a low risk of causing hypoglycaemia, 24  providing DPP‐IV inhibition between 60 and 80%. 25  Furthermore, in large clinical trials DPP‐IV inhibitors have shown noninferiority against placebo for major adverse cardiovascular events. 19 ,  20 ,  21  Clinical data on beneficial effects in terms of preserving heart function after myocardial ischaemia are promising, but are only taken from pilot studies. 26 
 In preclinical models of heart failure, high dose, but not low dose, administration of DPP‐IV inhibitors protected renal and improved cardiac function. 27 ,  28  This leads to the question of whether a parenteral drug formulation providing 100% bioavailability translating into continuously high DPP‐IV inhibition is possibly required to provide modulation of the SDF‐1/CXCR4 axis including these beneficial effects on cardiac remodelling. This trial therefore investigated the safety and tolerability, as well as pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD), of parenterally administered dutogliptin, a selective DPP‐IV inhibitor, in healthy male subjects. 2 METHODS 2.1 Study design and participants In this prospective, dose‐escalating phase I trial, healthy male volunteers were recruited from the Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Medical University of Vienna. Inclusion criteria were age between ≥18 and ≤35 years and body weight between ≥60 and ≤95 kg at screening. Subjects were excluded if they had any history of anaphylaxis, metabolic disease or present human immunodeficiency virus antibodies, as well as hepatitis B or C surface antigen. The complete list of eligibility criteria is available with the supplement. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects before any study‐related action was performed. The intention‐to‐treat population included all participants who received at least 1 dose of assigned treatment. The per‐protocol population included all participants without major protocol deviations. The trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical University of Vienna and the National Competent Authority and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. The trial was registered with EudraCT (2015‐002233‐21). 2.2 Study parts and group allocation This study was conducted in 2 parts (part A+ part B) with dose‐escalating groups (Figure  1 ). In part A, 25 participants were allocated consecutively to 5 dosing cohorts of 5 participants each. Dutogliptin administration was performed as a single‐dose application. Participants in group 1 received 30 mg of dutogliptin intravenously. Subjects in groups 2–5 received dutogliptin subcutaneously at doses of 30, 60, 90 and 120 mg, respectively. Figure 1 Study flowchart. †One subject in Group 4 was lost to follow‐up, after completing the visit 24 hours after drug administration. Therefore, all pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics analysis could be assessed and the per‐protocol analysis still included all 40 subject. i.v., intravenous; s.c., subcutaneous In part B, 15 participants were included into 3 dosing cohorts with 5 participants each. Dutogliptin was administered at the same time in the morning on 7 consecutive days at doses of 60, 90 or 120 mg depending on group allocation. 2.3 Dose rationale No concentration–effect relationships were derived from available preclinical protocols as the pharmacological basis for the selection of the dose range to be investigated in this study. The starting dose was based on the no observed adverse effects (AEs) level of a 28‐day toxicity study in rats. The no observed AEs level observed was 30 mg/kg, translating into 180 mg/m 2 . Given a 10‐fold safety margin, the calculated dose for an average human with body surface area of 1.8 m 2  was 32.4 mg. Therefore, the 30mg dose was chosen as the primarily administered dose. Typical dose escalation steps were used as appropriate for a first‐in‐man study design. Once it was established that the bioavailability was nearly 100%, the exposure profiles were simulated and the range of 30–120 mg targeting sustained DPP‐IV inhibition (≥80% over 24 h) was set. A stepwise 100, 50 and 33.3% increase was chosen to provide sufficient data for the primary outcome. 3 PROCEDURES 3.1 Study drug Oral formulations of dutogliptin have been investigated extensively in large phase III trials involving patients with diabetes mellitus II, and showed excellent safety and tolerability. For this trial, a parenteral formulation was investigated (PHX1149T/dutogliptin tartrate salt) and provided in sterile water for injection. The study drug was prepared by a pharmacist and handed over to the investigator in ready‐to‐use syringes for either intravenous or subcutaneous administration. After the first 2 groups in part A, PK variables were analysed to compare differences in bioavailability between intravenous and subcutaneous administration. Based on these results, the future administration route was determined. Recruitment for part B only started after an interim‐safety review for all part A subjects. 3.2 Safety parameters The interim safety review and final analysis was based on laboratory assessments, physical examination, electrocardiogram changes and monitoring of systemic and local AEs. At the primary study site initiation meeting, all investigators attended a thorough briefing in order to provide consistent reporting of AEs. The severity of AEs was graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.03. The term  serious AE  was used as defined by the International Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The relationship between AEs and study drug administration was assessed by the investigators as probable, possible, unlikely or unrelated. Those reported as probably or possibly associated with study drug administration were interpreted as related AEs. Injection‐site reactions were assessed and analysed separately from systemic AEs. Injection‐site reactions included swelling, haematoma, induration, erythema, itching and pain (with and without touching) at any time point at the site of the subcutaneous injection. Grading of injection site reactions was based on subjective severity as well as size assessed using a standardized measuring tape, where applicable. Local AEs were considered to be moderate or severe if the diameter exceeded 5 or 10 cm, respectively. Laboratory assessments included blood analysis of haematological variables and clinical chemistry as well as urinalysis. All were performed at the screening visit. In part A, blood safety analysis was additionally done 1 and 7 (±3) days after study drug administration. In part B, blood safety analysis was performed 1, 3, 6 and 14 (±3) days after the first dose. Laboratory values were interpreted in relation to changes from baseline values obtained at the screening visit. 3.3 Assessment of PK/PD Blood samples were obtained from indwelling venous lines at predefined time points into 9‐mL tubes containing K 3 EDTA and immediately put on ice. Samples were centrifuged at 2000  g  for 10 minutes and plasma was stored at –80°C until being analysed. In part A, group 1, these included 12 time points over 24 hours after end of intravenous infusion. For the remaining groups (2–5), 10 time points for blood sampling were defined over 24 hours after subcutaneous study injection. In part B, blood sampling was performed in all groups at 10 time points over 24 hours after first and last study drug administration, as well as predose and 8 hours after administration on the other days. Plasma levels of dutogliptin were assessed by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. The calibration curve range for liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry was 1.00–1000 ng/mL. Concentrations less than the lower limit of quantitation (1.00 ng/mL) were set to zero. Plasma was extracted using acetonitrile/MeOH/formic acid (90/10/1 v/v/v) spiked with IS (d6‐dutogliptin). Samples were centrifuged, the supernatant was removed and then dried under a nitrogen stream. Reconstitution was performed with water/MeOH/1M l‐octanesulfonic acid ( https://tel:65/25/10/1 ) and injected for mass spectrometry analysis. Analysis of the plasma PK profiles included measurements of C max , T max  and T last . With the observed values, area under the plasma concentration  vs  time curve (AUC) up to 24 hours (AUC 0‐24h ) and extrapolated to infinity (AUC inf ), elimination half‐life (T 1/2 ), and the terminal elimination rate constant (λ z ) were calculated. Bioavailability (F), expressed as a percentage, was calculated for each single administration dose group for part 1 only (Table  S1 ). Systemic exposure and accumulation of dutogliptin were assessed by ratios of AUC 0‐24h  in subjects receiving multiple dose administration. For PD analysis, the %activity was determined using the DPP IV activity data acquired from a commercially available enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (Enzo Life Science, Inc., Lausen, Switzerland) in mean fluorescence units (MFU) and converted to %activity with the predose sample = 100% activity of DPP IV [postdose sample %activity = (postdose MFU/predose MFU)*100]. Analyses were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. 4 OUTCOMES The primary study endpoint was safety and tolerability of parenterally administered dutogliptin in the intention‐to‐treat population. Secondary outcome measures included PK/PD data in the per‐protocol population. 5 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Descriptive analysis was performed for PK/PD variables reported as means with standard deviation (SD). The noncompartmental PK parameters C max , T max  and AUC were determined. Plasma DPP‐IV inhibition over time was assessed by determining the area under the effect‐curve up to 24 hours after administration (AUEC 0‐24h ) using the linear trapezoidal method. With the input from PK/PD assessments from once daily administrations, a 2‐compartment model was established to simulate various doses of twice daily administration to achieve &gt;80% DPP‐IV inhibition over 24 hours. Adverse events were reported descriptively with subjects affected by at least 1 AE, percentages of all subjects with at least 1 AE and total number of recorded events. No imputation was performed for missing PK/PD data. For missing AEs, assignment to seriousness, severity, outcome or relatedness, worst case imputation would be performed. Either χ 2  tests or Fisher exact tests were used to determine differences between groups. Intergroup comparisons for continuous variables were performed using either  t  tests or Kruskal–Wallis tests. A 2‐sided  P ‐value of .05 was defined as significant. SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used to calculate the noncompartmental analysis and to summarize the data by dose group for the clinical study report, using a predefined analysis plan for PK/PD data analysis. Phoenix WinNonlin (Certara, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used for interim data analysis and simulations. 6 RESULTS Between 24 May and 29 September 2017, 41 volunteers were screened for eligibility, of whom 40 were included. Baseline characteristics were similar between study groups (Table  1 ). In total, 1 subject was lost to follow‐up (Part A), as he did not return for the end‐of‐study visit. All PK/PD samples were collected and therefore the intention‐to‐treat and the per‐protocol population both included 40 subjects.

Percentages are given within each column. No significant differences in demographic data were observed between groups. 6.1 Safety of dutogliptin 6.1.1 Systemic adverse events Laboratory values, including glucose levels, electrocardiogram results and findings on physical examination were compared to baseline values obtained during the screening visit. No changes were observed in these values during the study period. A total of 6 related systemic AEs were reported. None of these were considered to impair the daily life of study participants, and all were classified as mild ( n =  5) or moderate ( n =  1). The single moderate AE was headache that required concomitant medication, which occurred in the 120mg single dose group. No dose‐dependent increase for related systemic AEs was observed ( P  &gt; .999). When pooling in respect to single or multiple‐dose administration, there was a nonsignificant trend towards more subjects in the multiple‐dose groups with at least 1 related systemic AE ( P =  .06). Two nonrelated severe AEs were reported, 1 of which was classified as a serious AE because it required hospitalization. The reported serious AE related to a head injury sustained from a physical assault in a public place on day 4 after dutogliptin administration. One day after the head injury, the subject experienced diplopia, which was classified as a severe AE and had not resolved by the end of the study. In addition to the head injury, the subject also suffered fractures to the cervical vertebra C1, mandible and cheekbone, which required surgery. The subject received concomitant medication including metamizol once (500 mg, orally), paracetamol 3 times daily (1 g, intravenously), enoxaparin twice daily (40 mg, subcutaneously) and aspirin (100 mg, orally, ongoing after final examination). A complete listing of nonrelated AEs is given in Table  S2 . 6.2 Local tolerability Mild local injection site reactions requiring no intervention comprised 147 of 153 (96%) related AEs (Table  2 ). Most frequently occurring local AEs were erythema ( n =  94) and induration ( n =  26). None of the local AEs required any intervention or had impact on subjects’ daily life. Intravenous bolus injection of the study drug was not associated with any AEs.

Three local AEs (all erythema) were classified as moderate because the diameter exceeded 5 cm, but they did not require further action to be taken. There was no dose‐dependent increase in subjects experiencing at least 1 local AE ( P  &gt; .999). When pooling single‐dose administration and multidose administration there were significantly more subjects in the multidose groups experiencing induration ( P =  .001) and pain with touching ( P =  .01). The number of subjects with at least 1 related local AE was not different between single and multiple subcutaneous drug administration as well as between each dosing cohort. The severity of AEs was similar between all dosing cohorts. 6.3 PK/PD Maximum plasma concentrations increased dose dependently with highest values in subjects receiving 120 mg on day 0 ( n =  10; 5093 ng/mL [SD: 873]) and day 6 ( n =  5; 6024 ng/mL [SD: 544],  P =  .05), respectively (Figure  S1 ). Bioavailability for 30, 60, 90 and 120 mg were 99, 109, 96 and 95%, respectively. The half‐life of dutogliptin was 3.68 hours after intravenous injection (SD: 0.79), which was comparable to subcutaneous injection (3.49 h; SD: 0.46). Mean accumulation ratios based on AUC 0‐24h  were 0.90, 1.02 and 1.03 for 60, 90, and 120 mg dutogliptin, respectively (Table  3 ). Individual accumulation ratios ranged from 0.86 to 0.95 for 60 mg dutogliptin, 0.92 to 1.16 for 90 mg dutogliptin and 0.92 to 1.09 for 120 mg dutogliptin.

Regarding PD, the time to maximum DPP‐IV inhibition was dose and route dependent. Intravenous application of 30 mg dutogliptin resulted in maximum inhibition at 0.5 hours. Lowest DPP‐IV activity in patients receiving subcutaneous administration was reached within 2 hours for 30 and 60 mg dutogliptin and within 4 hours for 90 and 120 mg dutogliptin (Figure  S2 ). DPP‐IV activity was reduced to &lt;10% in all participants receiving 60 mg or more subcutaneously. The lowest DPP‐IV activity on day 0 of subcutaneous dutogliptin administration was overall 7.19% (SD: 1.60). Subjects receiving 120 mg of dutogliptin had the lowest DPP‐IV activity of 5.88% (SD: 1.65). The longest DPP‐IV inhibiting effect was seen in the highest dosing cohort receiving multiple administration (120 mg) with a maximum AUEC 0‐24h  of 342 h % (SD: 73) on day 6 (Figure  2 ), translating into 86% DPP‐IV inhibition over 24 hours.

The simulated model for twice daily simulation of subjects receiving 60 mg of dutogliptin are likewise given in the supplement (Figure  S3 , Table  3 ). 7 DISCUSSION 7.1 Safety Parenterally injected dutogliptin showed a very good safety profile overall. No study drug‐related severe or serious AEs were observed. While the majority of subjects experienced some injection‐site related reaction, none required any action to be taken or caused disruption of daily life. More subjects with multidose administration of dutogliptin experienced induration and pain with touching, while overall numbers of subjects with 1 local AE were not different. Likewise, subjects with multiple dose administration showed a nonsignificant trend towards experiencing at least 1 systemic AE. We interpreted these results as possibly related to the higher number of visits in the multidose group, as subjects were assessed daily for 7 days for any AEs. The increase could furthermore be related to a delayed manifestation of AEs in regard to study drug administration. This could have been missed in single‐dose subjects, as follow up for AEs was only performed 1 day after study drug injection, i.e. when delayed AEs might be pending, and on day 7 after study drug injection, when AEs might have resolved and thus were not reported by the subject. To reduce this bias in a future trial, the number of visits and observation periods should be the same for all dosing cohorts, regardless of whether it is a single‐ or multidrug administration cohort. This could serve to minimize any underreporting of local AEs on days where no visit is performed. Furthermore, a placebo‐controlled study could help to assess the relevance of systemic AEs directly related to dutogliptin administration. Local reactions after subcutaneous injection of drugs are common 29 ; these include reactions following the administration of therapeutics used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus type II such as insulin, exenatide and liraglutide. To minimize irritation, rotation of injection site is recommended. 30  It is still being debated whether slow or fast injection rates should be favoured for subcutaneous injections. 31  While the rationale behind slow application is the avoidance of the sudden distension of the subcutis, 30  quick injection provides the advantage of short contact time and minimizes painful lateral movement of the needle within the tissue. 32  Another critical issue causing pain during and after injection is the formulation of the injected drug, particularly with regards to its viscosity and the additional excipients required for adequate resorption, as well as the administered volume. 33  Lowering the volume of parenteral dutogliptin may reduce local irritability, which could easily be accomplished by providing higher concentrated solutions. 7.2 PK/PD To date, only oral gliptins with an average bioavailability of about 80% are available. 25  To be more specific, vildagliptin and saxagliptin show oral bioavailability of 85 and 67% respectively, while sitaglitpin's bioavailability is 87%. 25  In comparison, subcutaneous injection of dutogliptin resulted in approximately 100% bioavailability with peak plasma concentrations of 5000 ng/mL after subcutaneous injection of 120 mg. Compared to 500 mg orally administered dutogliptin, this translates into a &gt;6‐fold increase in maximal plasma levels. 34 
 The terminal half‐life of currently available oral gliptines show wide variability, ranging from 3 hours (vildagliptin) to 105 hours (linagliptin). Subcutaneously administered dutogliptin had a half‐life of approximately 3.5 hours, which is comparable to that of vildagliptin and saxagliptin. The half‐life of oral dutogliptin was 3‐fold longer 34  than that of the iv or sc dosing used in the current trial. The apparently longer half‐life after oral intake may be due to prolonged (but incomplete) resorption after oral intake. Results from AUC 0‐24h  suggest that a steady state exposure was reached in this dose range, with no relevant accumulation upon repeated daily dosing, because mean accumulation ratios did not reach statistical significance. Likewise, dose intervals exceeded 5‐times the elimination half‐life, which makes accumulation unlikely. Maximum plasma concentrations of dutogliptin were higher on day 6 compared to day 0 in the multiple administration cohort, which, however, does not reflect the systemic exposure over 24 hours. Subcutaneous injection of 120 mg dutogliptin reduced DPP‐IV activity to below 6%, translating into &gt;86% DPP‐IV inhibition over 24 hours. Likewise, the 60 mg twice daily administration from the simulated model could be a promising option to achieve an improved continuous DPP‐IV inhibition. In comparison, currently available oral doses and formulations of gliptins are capable of reducing DPP‐IV activity by between 60 and 80% over 24 hours, 25  and are only approved for treatment of diabetes mellitus type II. However, besides its well‐known function of improving glycaemic control, DPP‐IV activity influences several other pathways providing potential cardio‐ and renoprotective effects. 35  Knock‐out mice have shown proof of concept for the crucial involvement of DPP‐IV in myocardial infarction, as those animals lacking DPP‐IV showed longer survival after the event. 36  Likewise, pharmacological inactivation of DPP‐IV by gliptins improved recovery from ischaemic injury in mice. 36 
 Another approach to further augment beneficial effects on cardiac remodelling is the combined administration of G‐CSF and DPP‐IV inhibitors, by specifically targeting the SDF‐1 axis. Coadministration significantly improved cardiac function and survival in mice and therefore may be a promising and novel therapeutic approach to prevent heart failure after myocardial infarction. 12 ,  18  The combination of G‐CSF and DPP‐IV inhibitors is probably crucial to promote the beneficial effects on myocardial remodelling, because G‐CSF reduces early cardiomyocyte apoptosis. However, to date, no clinical data are available on the safety of the combined application of G‐CSF and DPP‐IV inhibitors, which therefore requires further evaluation. As G‐CSF is injected subcutaneously, it could potentially be provided as a 1‐syringe combination therapy with dutogliptin. Particularly in patients with myocardial infarction, a subcutaneous formulation of DPP‐IV inhibitors could overcome both swallowing difficulties and impaired drug uptake due to pharmacological or critical illness‐related impairment of gastric emptying. 37 ,  38  Another advantage of a parenteral formulation is that it is independent of fed/fasting conditions, and therefore reduces intrapatient variability and increases predictable high plasma concentrations and pharmacological activity. Oral administration of 400 mg dutogliptin inhibited DPP‐IV activity by approximately 85%, 34  but led to lower plasma concentrations compared to parenteral application. We can only speculate as to whether local tissue DPP‐IV inhibition increases with plasma concentration, which might be warranted for improved cardiomyocyte recruitment, as has been suggested by preclinical models investigating vildagliptin. 27 ,  28  However, it needs to be determined how plasma and tissue concentrations of DPP‐IV activity are related. To date, no data are available on regional tissue DPP‐IV inhibition after dutogliptin administration. Therefore, no assumptions can be made on equivalent doses of dutogliptin and vildagliptin to yield beneficial effects regarding cardiac function. Obviously, local tissue DPP‐IV inhibition cannot be measured in humans and therefore large‐scale clinical phase II/III trials involving patients after myocardial infarction are warranted to determine whether DPP‐IV inhibition achieved by parenterally administered dutogliptin can prevent maladaptive remodelling. For an ongoing phase II proof of concept study ( http://clinicaltrials.gov  identifier: NCT03486080), a twice daily regime of dutogliptin administration was chosen based on the simulated 2‐compartment model in order to provide continuous high DPP‐IV inhibition. While the development of oral dutogliptin has been terminated due to huge market competition in the treatment of diabetes mellitus type II, a new parenteral formulation could pave the way for novel indications, warranting further evaluation in clinical trials. 7.3 Limitations Only male volunteers were included in our study, which needs to be considered as a limitation. To date, no sex‐related differences in efficacy have been described for approved orally available gliptins. 39  Interestingly, sitagliptin plasma levels were approximately 25% higher in female subjects, which, however, did not translate into differences in efficacy 40  and was thus considered irrelevant in clinical practice, where no sex‐specific dose adjustment is suggested. 25 
 Approved orally available gliptins show an excellent safety profile, but concerns have been raised regarding an increased risk of pancreatitis associated with DPP‐IV inhibitor (sitagliptin, saxagliptin and valdagliptin) intake. 41 ,  42 ,  43 ,  44  However, data remain controversial, 45  and it is unclear whether this is an effect related to exposure in terms of maximal concentrations and/or duration of treatment. This phase I trial was too small to detect any rare AEs, and further large‐scale clinical trials would be needed to detect these. As the development of oral dutogliptin has been terminated due to large market competition, large long‐term safety data are currently not available. As the starting dose of 30 mg administered dutogliptin was well tolerated, lower doses have not been investigated. In addition, the twice daily simulation has only been performed for the 60‐mg dosing cohort. Both need to be considered a limitation of the current investigation. Another limitation of our study relates to the assay sensitivity and attributed lower limit of detection threshold of the used enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay kit for DPP‐IV activity determination. Due to analytical limitations of the DPP‐IV assay it cannot be determined whether 100% inhibition of DPP‐IV activity can be reached. Therefore, the dose linearity of inhibition can best be seen by a prolongation of the maximum inhibition reached (&gt;90%). Furthermore, downstream effects of DPP‐IV inhibition, such as SDF‐1 activity, have not been investigated in this trial due to the instability of plasma samples after 1 freeze–thaw cycle. 8 CONCLUSION Parenteral injection of dutogliptin was safe and subcutaneous bioavailability is excellent. DPP‐IV inhibition increased dose dependently to &gt;86% over 24 hours after multiple doses of 120 mg dutogliptin. COMPETING INTERESTS D.N. and R.S. are employed by RECARDIO, Inc.

    <Body>What is Already Known about this Subject 
 Evacetrapib is a cholesteryl ester‐transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor currently under investigation to reduce cardiovascular events in patients with high risk vascular disease. The patient population expected to take CETP inhibitors is likely to be taking multiple concomitant medications, including statins, which are predominately metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP)‐3A. Clinically relevant drug–drug interactions (DDIs) with evacetrapib could potentially affect the safety and/or efficacy of other drugs taken by this patient population. 
 What this Study Adds 
 A clinical study with probe substrates selected by  in vitro  risk assessment and modelling approaches suggests no evidence of clinically relevant DDI with evacetrapib as the perpetrator drug. Evacetrapib minimally impacted exposure to simvastatin, a commonly prescribed statin, suggesting that dose adjustments to this medication will not be warranted. 
 Introduction Progress has been achieved in reducing cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality, largely through increased use of lipid‐lowering therapies such as low‐density lipoprotein‐cholesterol (LDL‐C)‐lowering HMG‐CoA reductase inhibitors (statins)  1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 . However, therapies targeting other lipid‐related risk factors are needed to address the residual risk of cardiovascular events that persists in many patients. Substantial epidemiological data indicate high‐density lipoprotein‐cholesterol (HDL‐C) levels are inversely correlated with cardiovascular disease risk  5 ,  6 ,  7 . Potent inhibition of cholesteryl ester‐transfer protein (CETP), a plasma glycoprotein that mediates the transfer of cholesteryl ester from HDL‐C to apolipoprotein B‐rich lipoproteins in exchange for triglycerides  8 , leads to decreases of LDL‐C and increases of HDL‐C concentrations. Although two previous CETP inhibitors, torcetrapib and dalcetrapib, were terminated in late‐stage clinical development, there is still considerable interest in this mechanism as a therapeutic strategy to decrease atherogenic and increase anti‐atherogenic lipoprotein levels. Evacetrapib, an investigational CETP inhibitor, has not demonstrated the off‐target liabilities associated with torcetrapib, has been well tolerated and has demonstrated clinically relevant pharmacodynamic (PD) efficacy in early phase development  9 . In patients with dyslipidaemia, evacetrapib by itself or in combination with statins increased HDL‐C concentrations and decreased LDL‐C concentrations without producing significant changes in blood pressure, aldosterone, cortisol or electrolytes. CETP inhibitors are likely to be utilized in combination with statins, which are largely metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) and are substrates for the hepatic organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 transporter (OATP1B1)  10 . In addition, the patient population expected to take CETP inhibitors (i.e., those at high risk for vascular disease) are likely to be taking multiple concomitant medications. Consequently, there is a need to understand the benefit‐to‐risk profile for evacetrapib, including the potential for this drug to affect the safety and/or efficacy of other drugs taken by this patient population. Results from  in vitro  studies, predictions, and two clinical studies conducted to assess the potential for inhibitory and inducing drug‐drug interactions (DDI) mediated by evacetrapib are presented. Methods Reversible inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms in human liver microsomes Experiments were performed at CellzDirect, Inc. (Austin, TX, USA) utilizing evacetrapib as the lysine salt in human hepatic microsomes. Each patient whose tissue was used in this study was fully consented under an institutional review board (IRB) application. Samples were shipped to CellzDirect's facility in Durham, NC, USA for processing under protocols approved during the IRB application process. Briefly, evacetrapib was incubated at 37°C in 100 m m  potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with probe substrates and β‐nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 2′‐phosphate (NADPH) under linear conditions with respect to protein content and incubation time. Following the incubation interval, reactions were stopped, processed for analysis and analyzed by LC‐MS/MS for metabolite formation. Assay‐specific conditions are summarized in Table  1 . Table 1

Reversible inhibition in microsomes. † 
Time‐dependent inhibition in microsomes. ‡ 
Effects in hepatocytes. Data analysis The apparent  K 
 i  value (dissociation constant for the enzyme inhibitor complex) was generated by fit of the appropriate inhibition model using conventional relationships for inhibition to the data using WinNonlin Enterprise Edition version 4.1 (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA, USA)  11 . To predict the risk of a clinical DDI, basic models of reversible inhibition were used. In accordance with the FDA  12  and EMA  13  guidelines on the investigation of drug interactions, I/ K 
 i  and I u / K 
 i  values were calculated to relate  in vitro  to  in vivo  risk, where I is the predicted maximum total plasma drug concentration ( C 
 max ) at the highest recommended dose, also taking into consideration the unbound fraction, u, specific to the EMA guideline. Thus, I u  is the unbound mean plasma  C 
 max  with the highest recommended dose. Since the unbound fraction of evacetrapib in human plasma is very low and prone to uncertainty (&lt;0.1%, data not presented), a surrogate value of 1% is recommended for use in the calculation in accordance with European guidelines. For CYP3A inhibitors, it is also recommended to take into consideration inhibition of the enzyme in the gut, where R = 1 + [I] gut / K 
 i  and [I] gut  = molar dose/250 ml in accordance with FDA guidelines. Similarly, using the EMA guidance, this equation is [I]/ K 
 i , where [I] is the maximum dose taken at one occasion/250 ml. In addition to the previously described basic model equations, the more recent mechanistic static models of CYP inhibition proposed by Fahmi  14  were also used in accordance with the FDA and EMA guidances for drug interaction studies  12 ,  13 . The mechanistic static model is described by the following equation:
 AUCR = 1 / A g × B g × C g × 1 − F g + F g × ( 1 / A h × B h × C h × f m + 1 − f m 
 where A is the reversible inhibition in either the gut (A g ) or liver (A h ), B is the time‐dependent inhibition in either the gut (B g ) or liver (B h ), and C is the induction in either the gut (C g ) or liver (C h ). The equations for A, B, and C are further characterized in the FDA and EMA guidances and are not described within the context of this manuscript  12 ,  13 . Additionally, F g  is described as the fraction of drug available after intestinal metabolism and f m  is the fraction of systemic clearance of the substrate mediated by the CYP enzyme responsible for its metabolism. The complex equation described above is the same in both the FDA and EMA guidances. However, as previously discussed, there are slight differences in the inputs utilized in each. In the EMA, but not FDA, guidance, the unbound fraction is taken into account, with a conservative input of 1% being utilized for highly protein bound drugs to account for uncertainties in the estimates. These equations are described in detail in the regulatory guidances. Time‐dependent inhibition of CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes In the inactivation assay, 100 m m  sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 1 m m  ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1 m m  NADPH and various concentrations of evacetrapib (lysine salt) were pre‐warmed for 3 min at 37°C in triplicate. Reactions were initiated with the addition of human liver microsomes. Then, at multiple time points, 5 µl aliquots were diluted 1/20 into pre‐warmed (37°C) tubes containing the CYP3A4 residual activity mixture. The residual activity assay mixture contained the CYP3A4 substrate midazolam and NADPH (1 m m ). Activity reactions were quenched, samples were processed and then analyzed for 1‐hydroxymidazolam by LC‐MS/MS. Assay‐specific conditions are summarized in Table  1 . Data analysis Estimates of the following kinetic parameters were determined according to regulatory guidances and Ring  et al .:  k 
 inact  (maximal inactivation rate constant), K I  (apparent inactivation constant), CL inact  (ratio of  k 
 inact / K 
 I ) and  K 
 obs  (apparent inactivation rate constant)  12 ,  13 ,  15 .  K 
 deg  is the apparent first order degradation rate constant of the affected enzyme. The basic model equation for time‐dependent inhibition (TDI), in accordance with both FDA and EMA regulatory guidances  12 ,  13 , utilized was the following:
 R = K o b s + K deg / K deg , 
 where  K 
 obs  =  k 
 inact [I]/( K 
 I +[I]), noting that two separate  K 
 deg  values for CYP3A were utilized, one for intestinal CYP3A and one for hepatic CYP3A. Additionally, in terms of protein binding, the total [I] was utilized according to the FDA guidance, whereas the conservative unbound [I] value of 1% was used for highly protein bound drugs in accordance with the EMA guidance  12 ,  13 . Effects on CYP3A in human hepatocyte cultures Experiments and analyses were performed at CellzDirect, Inc. (Durham, NC and Austin, TX, USA). Hepatocytes from three individual donor livers (designated as ‘lots’) were isolated by a collagenase perfusion method described by LeCluyse and associates  16 ,  17  and then plated. Cells were also resuspended in 60 mm dishes for microsomal preparation required for immunoblotting. Cells were maintained in media (William's E Medium, 6.25 µg ml –1  insulin, 6.25 µg l –1  transferrin, 6.25 ng ml –1  selenium and extracellular matrix proteins) for 3 days prior to initiating treatment with evacetrapib (in triplicate) for up to 72 h. Cells were also incubated with 0.1% MeOH (vehicle control) or 10 µ m  rifampicin (CYP3A induction control). Following incubation, cultures were rinsed twice with ice‐cold Hanks' Balanced Salt solution (HBSS). HBSS (0.5 ml) containing the CYP3A‐selective substrate, testosterone, was applied to the cells. Following the appropriate incubation period, supernatants were removed and frozen until LC‐MS/MS analysis for 6β‐OH testosterone. Assay conditions are summarized in Table  1 . mRNA preparation and qRT‐PCR determinations Cells were lyzed and frozen until total RNA was isolated. Approximately 200 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed using the Applied Biosystems High Capacity cDNA Archive Kit according to the manufacturer's procedures. The resulting cDNA was assayed for relative quantities of CYP3A4 and normalized to the endogenous control, glyceraldehyde 3‐phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), using Applied Biosystems TaqMan® (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). Western immunoblotting for CYP3A4 Homogenization buffer was added to each dish and cells were harvested by scraping, pooled by treatment group, and lysed. Microsomal pellets were prepared by centrifugation at ~4°C (9000  g  for 20 min followed by further centrifugation of supernatants at 100 000  g  for 60 min) and resuspended in 0.25  m  sucrose. Samples (20 µg) were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate‐polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and proteins were transferred electrophoretically from the polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked for ≥1 h at room temperature in casein buffer and incubated ≥2 h at room temperature with primary antibodies diluted in casein buffer. CYP3A4 protein levels were determined with polyclonal antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were visualized on a Fluor‐S Chemiluminescence imager with either enhanced chemiluminescence plus (ECL+; Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) or SuperSignal detection systems (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Clinical study A: drug–drug interaction of evacetrapib with midazolam and tolbutamide in healthy adult subjects Study design A phase 1 single‐site, placebo‐controlled, investigator and subject‐blinded, parallel, multiple‐ascending dose study evaluated safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics of evacetrapib over four planned dose levels  18 . Subjects eligible for the study were between the ages of 18 and 60 years and had a BMI of 18.5 to 35.0 kg m –2 . The Clinical Research Unit was located in Baltimore, MD, USA and the study protocol was reviewed by Chesapeake Research Review, Inc (Columbia, MD, USA), which maintains full accreditation with the Association for the Accreditation of Hurman Research Protection Programs. Two cohorts incorporated the evaluation of DDI potential of evacetrapib with two sensitive CYP substrates using an established drug cocktail containing midazolam 200 µg and tolbutamide 500 mg, which are highly selective probe substrates for CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, respectively  19 . Each cohort of 15 healthy adults had subjects randomized to receive either evacetrapib or matched placebo in a ratio of 12 : 3. Subjects received drug cocktail prior to study drug and on day 1. Subjects also received repeated daily doses of evacetrapib 100 mg or 300 mg or placebo for 15 days ( n  = 30 subjects). The pharmacokinetics of midazolam and tolbutamide were evaluated prior to administration of evacetrapib and on day 15 after evacetrapib had reached steady‐state concentrations. To maximize enzyme inhibition prior to the probe cocktail administration, evacetrapib was administered ~2 h before the administration of the probes on day 15. Plasma probe concentrations were measured immediately before and by serial collections up to 46 h after giving the drug cocktail (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 22 and 46 h). Bioanalysis K 2 EDTA human plasma samples obtained during this study were analyzed at Bioanalytical Systems, Inc. (BASi; West Lafayette, IN, USA) for concentrations of evacetrapib using a validated LC‐MS/MS method (data on file, Eli Lilly and Company). The dynamic range for the assay was 1 to 1000 ng ml –1 . Samples above the limit of quantification were diluted and re‐analyzed to yield results within the calibrated range. The inter‐assay accuracy (% relative error) during validation ranged from −6.0% to 6.2%. The inter‐assay precision (% relative standard deviation) during validation ranged from 2.1% to 6.4%. Plasma samples were analyzed for midazolam and 1′‐hydroxymidazolam using the validated LC‐MS/MS method at Advion BioServices, Inc. (Advion; Ithaca, NY, USA). The dynamic range for both analytes was 0.01 to 10 ng ml –1 . The inter‐and intra‐assay accuracy ranged from −0.56% to 20.0% for midazolam, and from −2.90% to 11.7% for 1′‐hydroxymidazolam. The inter‐ and intra‐assay precision was ≤9.64% for midazolam and ≤9.71% for 1′‐hydroxymidazolam. Plasma samples were also analyzed for tolbutamide using a validated LC‐MS/MS method at Covance Laboratories Inc. (Madison, WI, USA). The dynamic range of the assay was 5 to 2000 ng ml –1 . Samples above the limit of quantification were diluted and re‐analyzed to yield results within the calibrated range. The intra‐assay accuracy for tolbutamide ranged from 94.7% to 106% and the intra‐assay precision ranged from 6.2% to 8.3%. Pharmacokinetic analysis Pharmacokinetic parameter estimates for evacetrapib, midazolam, 1′‐hydroxymidazolam and tolbutamide were calculated by standard non‐compartmental methods of analysis. The primary parameters were maximum concentration ( C 
 max ) and area under the curve (AUC) of evacetrapib, midazolam, 1′‐hydroxymidazolam and tolbutamide. A mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis was conducted to estimate mean AUC(0,∞) and  C 
 max  of midazolam and tolbutamide in the presence and absence of evacetrapib. The MMRM model used log‐transformed AUC(0,∞) and  C 
 max  as the response and included log‐transformed dose, treatment (with or without evacetrapib) and log‐transformed dose by treatment interaction as fixed effects, and subject as a random effect. Least squares geometric mean ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for the inference of exposure ratios of midazolam and tolbutamide in the presence and absence of evacetrapib. Clinical study B: drug–drug interaction of evacetrapib with simvastatin in dyslipidaemic patients Study design A randomized, double‐blind, double‐dummy, parallel group, placebo‐ and active‐controlled, multi‐site phase 2 efficacy and safety study of evacetrapib was conducted in adult patients (≥18 years;  n  = 398) with hypercholesterolaemia or low HDL‐C  9 . The trial was designed by the Cleveland Clinic Coordinating Center for Clinical Research (IRB approval # QUI1‐09–464) in collaboration with the sponsor and conducted at 70 sites internationally. Patients were randomized to 30, 100 or 500 mg evacetrapib daily as monotherapy, 40 mg simvastatin as monotherapy or in combination with 100 mg evacetrapib, or placebo alone. Treatment duration was 12 weeks. To evaluate CYP‐mediated drug interactions, evacetrapib and simvastatin pharmacokinetic sampling occurred at weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 (visits 4, 5, 6 and 7). Sampling at each visit consisted of a pre‐dose and a post‐dose blood draw during the treatment to allow for population PK analysis with a maximum allowable window of 4 days. A single sample was also drawn at the follow‐up visit (visit 8, week 16–18) or after early discontinuation. Bioanalysis Plasma samples were analyzed for evacetrapib as described above. Plasma samples were also analyzed for simvastatin (parent = simvastatin lactone) and its metabolite (simvastatin acid) at Advion BioServices, Inc. (Advion; Ithaca, NY, USA) utilizing a validated LC‐MS/MS assay. For simvastatin and its metabolite, the detection range was 0.10 to 30 ng ml –1  for both analytes. The inter‐assay accuracy ranged from −1.0% to 13.2% for simvastatin and from −8.0% to 8.5% for simvastatin acid. The inter‐assay precision was ≤7.9% for simvastatin and ≤8.9% for simvastatin acid. For all analytes, when samples had concentrations above the limit of quantitation, samples were diluted to yield results within the calibrated range. Pharmacokinetic analysis Analyses were performed using a non‐linear mixed effect modelling approach as implemented in  nonmem  version 7. The  post hoc  Bayesian estimates of CL/ F  from the population PK models were used to calculate the ratio of the steady‐state AUC of the statin when co‐administered with evacetrapib relative to when the statin was administered alone, resulting in a mean ratio and the corresponding 95% CI. The geometric mean ratio of the plasma concentration of simvastatin to the corresponding metabolite at trough and  C 
 max  was also calculated for the statin alone and when co‐administered with evacetrapib. Additional assessments for both clinical drug–drug interaction studies Safety assessments in the drug–drug interaction studies Safety measurements included recording adverse events and evaluation of clinical laboratory data in both of the clinical studies. Ethical review of clinical studies Ethical Review Boards for the two clinical studies approved their respective protocols. Healthy subjects and patients in the clinical studies provided written informed consent prior to participation in study procedures. Results Reversible inhibition of CYP isoforms in human liver microsomes Based on  in vitro  inhibition of the metabolism of form‐selective substrates, evacetrapib inhibited several major CYP isoforms (CYPs 3A4, 2C19, 2C9, 2D6, 2C8, 2B6 and 1A2). Inhibition constant ( K 
 i ) values for evacetrapib ranged from 0.57 µ m  (CYP2C9) to 7.6 µ m  (CYP2C19) and are presented in Table  2 . To predict the risk of a clinical DDI, I/ K 
 i  values were calculated to relate  in vitro  to  in vivo  risk, where I is the predicted maximum total drug concentration ( C 
 max ) value (1.9 µ m ) for the phase 3 dose of 130 mg. The I/ K 
 i  values ranged from 0.25 (CYP2C19) to 3.30 (CYP2C9), also shown in Table  2 . Table 2

 In accordance with regulatory agency guidelines, the FDA and EMA basic models were applied as a first line assessment of DDI potential  12 ,  13 . Using the FDA guidance equation, the resulting R value was 2.57 or 4.30 for CYP3A or CYP2C9, respectively, also shown in Table  3 . Using the similar EMA equation, with different inputs described previously and an I u  value of 0.019 µ m  for the predicted phase 3 dose of 130 mg evacetrapib the I u / K

 i  = 0.03 for CYP2C9 (Table  3 ), with the lowest I u / K 
 i  value being 0.003 for CYP2C19 (Table  2 ). A clinical interaction study with a sensitive probe substrate is recommended if the R value &gt;1.1, using the FDA basic model, or if the ratio of I u / K 
 i  ≥ 0.02 using the EMA basic model. In both instances, the clinical DDI potential could not be excluded for evacetrapib and clinical studies were warranted.

Using full precision, these values fell slightly below the threshold to conduct a clinical study. However, values were rounded to account for inaccuracies, leading to the recommendation to conduct a clinical study. NA = not applicable. TDI = time‐dependent inhibition. MBI = mechanism‐based inhibition. Additionally, the potential for inhibition of CYP3A in the gastrointestinal tract by evacetrapib similarly could not be excluded. A clinical drug interaction study with a sensitive probe substrate is recommended when the R value ≥11. For a 130 mg maximum recommended dose of evacetrapib, the R value was 679.46 (Table  3 ). In a second line assessment, the mechanistic static models recommended in the FDA and EMA regulatory guidances  12 ,  13  were used to predict evacetrapib interactions with CYP3A and CYP2C9. The evacetrapib AUC ratio for CYP3A was predicted to be 1.76X or 2.95X using the mechanistic static models utilized by the FDA and EMA, respectively. The differences in the predicted AUC ratios derived by each method are attributed to the different inputs used in the respective equations as described previously. Nonetheless, since the AUC ratio falls outside of the 0.8 to 1.25 range, the modelled values are considered a positive effect regardless of which model is used, and clinical evaluation is warranted (Table  3 ). The FDA mechanistic static model predicted the evacetrapib AUC ratio for CYP2C9 to be 1.0, whereas using the more conservative unbound fraction term in the EMA mechanistic static model predicted slightly different AUC ratios of 1.13X or 1.12X, using either warfarin or tolbutamide as substrate, respectively (Table  3 ). Time‐dependent inhibition of CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes Time‐dependent inhibition (TDI) of CYP3A4‐mediated midazolam 1‐hydroxylation was observed for evacetrapib, yielding a  k 
 inact  value of 0.144 min –1  and  K 
 I  value of 34.0 µ m . The corresponding inactivation clearance (CL inact ) was 4.2 min −1  m m 
 −1 . Using the FDA and EMA TDI basic models, the predicted R values were 24.4 and 1.25, respectively. The difference in predicted R values is attributed to the unbound fraction inputs into the models, as previously described. However, predictions based on both FDA and EMA models warranted further clinical investigation (Table   3 ). Effects on CYP3A in human hepatocytes Primary cultures of fresh human hepatocytes responded to the positive control, rifampicin, appropriately, and the assay was deemed acceptable. Figure  1  shows the time‐course of effects of evacetrapib on CYP3A4 mRNA (Figure  1 A) and CYP3A‐mediated testosterone 6β‐hydroxylation activity (Figure  1 B). The effects of evacetrapib were concentration‐ and time‐dependent. There was little effect of 0.1 µ m  evacetrapib on mRNA and activity. However, in hepatocyte cultures treated with 1 and 10 µ m  evacetrapib, CYP3A4 mRNA levels increased by 8 h and remained elevated at 72 h. The average effect (treatment/vehicle) of 10 µ m  evacetrapib in the three lots at 72 h was 11.5 (51% of rifampicin, data on file). Decreases in CYP3A‐mediated activity were observed for 1 and 10 µ m  evacetrapib over the shorter treatment periods (2, 4 and 8 h). By 72 h, however, CYP3A‐mediated activity had returned to baseline (1 µ m ) or had rebounded to approximately 50% of baseline (10 µ m ) (Figure  1 ). Representative semi‐quantitative immunoblots showing CYP3A4 protein levels (Figure  2 ) show evacetrapib concentration‐related decreases in CYP3A4 protein at 8 h and slight concentration‐related increases in CYP3A4 protein at 72 h.

Panel A: 8 h; Panel B: 72 h Clinical study A: Drug–drug interaction study of evacetrapib with midazolam and tolbutamide in healthy human subjects Pharmacokinetics of midazolam and tolbutamide Administration of evacetrapib slightly increased midazolam exposure, whereas the effect on tolbutamide exposure was minimal (Figure  3 A and B). Geometric mean ratios of plasma midazolam AUC from time 0 to infinity (AUC(0,∞)) in the presence on day 1 and absence on day 15 of evacetrapib were 1.19 (95% CI 1.06, 1.33) ( P  = 0.004) and 1.44 (95% CI 1.28, 1.62) ( P  &lt; 0.001) for evacetrapib 100 mg and 300 mg, respectively (Table  4 ). Geometric mean ratios of  C 
 max  were 1.29 (95% CI 1.07, 1.54) ( P  = 0.009) and 1.26 (95% CI 1.04, 1.52) ( P  = 0.020), respectively. The exposures of the midazolam metabolite, 1′‐hydroxymidazolam, were not as strongly affected by evacetrapib as was midazolam itself. The AUC and  C 
 max  of 1′‐hydroxymidazolam were not significantly affected by 14 daily doses of 100 mg of evacetrapib. Following 14 daily doses of 300 mg of evacetrapib, the AUC(0,∞) of 1′‐hydroxymidazolam increased by a factor of 1.18. The  C 
 max  of 1′‐hydroxymidazolam was not significantly affected by 300 mg of evacetrapib (Table  4 ). The geometric mean ratios of plasma tolbutamide AUC(0,∞) in the presence and absence of evacetrapib were 0.85 (95% CI 0.77, 0.94) ( P  = 0.002) and 1.06 (95% CI 0.95, 1.18) ( P  = 0.262) following 14 daily doses of 100 mg or 300 mg, respectively; for  C

The elevation in hepatic transaminases in this subject occurred after the first administration of probe substrates and was less than three times the upper limit of normal range. Total bilirubin was in the normal range. Clinical study B: Drug–drug interaction study of evacetrapib with simvastatin in dyslipidaemic patients Pharmacokinetics of simvastatin Co‐administration of evacetrapib with simvastatin resulted in a mean AUC(0,τ ss ) ratio of 1.25 (95% CI 1.03, 1.53), relative to administering the statin alone (Table  5 ). The effect of evacetrapib on simvastatin exposure was statistically significant ( P  &lt; 0.025). The impact of evacetrapib on the geometric mean ratios between parent (simvastatin lactone) and metabolite (simvastatin acid) plasma concentrations at trough and  C 
 max  of simvastatin was minimal. At trough, the parent to metabolite ratios were 1.09 in both the absence and presence of evacetrapib, resulting in an overall ratio (statin + evacetrapib/statin alone) of 1.00. At  C 
 max , the parent to metabolite ratios were 4.15 and 4.77 in the absence and presence of evacetrapib, respectively, resulting in an overall ratio of 1.15.

Adverse events In patients receiving simvastatin alone or in combination with evacetrapib, no clinically important differences were found regarding clinical laboratories or treatment emergent adverse events. Discussion Evacetrapib is a reversible inhibitor of multiple cytochromes P450 (3A4, 2D6, 2C19, 2C9, 2C8, 1A2)  in vitro . A risk assessment using the basic and conservative I/ K 
 i  methods was performed and suggested that evacetrapib had the potential to inhibit the metabolism of co‐administered drugs metabolized by CYP3A and CYP2C9 because estimated I u / K 
 i  ratios exceeded the EMA‐recommended threshold of 0.02  13 . Based on the more recent FDA and EMA guidances, the reversible basic models of inhibition predicted clinically relevant DDI for both CYP3A and CYP2C9, while clinically relevant inhibition of CYP3A, but not CYP2C9, was predicted using the mechanistic static models  12 ,  13 . Furthermore, inhibition of CYP3A in the gut by evacetrapib was also predicted. 
 In vitro , evacetrapib was also identified as a time‐dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4 activity in microsomes and cultured hepatocytes. In the hepatocyte experiments, we investigated the time course of the effects of evacetrapib on CYP3A4 mRNA, total protein and activity in addition to the standard 48–72 h terminal time point. The effects of evacetrapib were dependent on the CYP3A end point being measured, treatment time, and evacetrapib concentration. At concentrations similar to those achieved in the clinic (1.9 µ m  for the phase 3 dose of 130 mg), mRNA levels increased within 8 h while inhibition of CYP3A activity in hepatocyte preparations appeared to manifest over short treatment intervals (2–8 h). At 72 h, the inhibitory effects on activity were no longer evident in preparations treated with 1 µ m  evacetrapib, but continued to dominate in preparations treated with 10 µ m  evacetrapib even though protein levels had rebounded. It was concluded that CYP3A4 was likely inactivated during the  in vitro  metabolism of evacetrapib, with the inactivated enzyme efficiently being removed from the pool of CYP3A4 recognizable by the immunoblotting antibody. Clinically relevant inhibition of CYP3A could not be ruled out, based on predictions utilizing the FDA and EMA basic models for time‐dependent/mechanism‐based inhibition. Overall, the combined data from the  in vitro  studies of evacetrapib in liver microsomes and hepatocyte preparations suggest a complex interplay of reversible inhibition, time‐dependent inhibition, induction of CYP3A and concentration‐dependent effects. Thus, a clinical CYP3A DDI study was warranted and midazolam was chosen as the sensitive substrate to probe this potential interaction. The  in vitro  risk assessment also suggested that evacetrapib had the potential to inhibit the metabolism of co‐administered drugs metabolized by CYP2C9, although the more recent mechanistic static model predictions suggested that there would not be a clinically significant interaction. However, a conservative approach was taken and the clinical DDI study was conducted utilizing tolbutamide as the CYP2C9 probe substrate. In the phase 1 study in healthy subjects, which utilized midazolam and tolbutamide probes, the AUC ratio data at steady‐state indicated that evacetrapib is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A but had no statistically significant effect on CYP2C9‐mediated metabolism. These conclusions are drawn based on the FDA and EMA classification criteria whereby weak inhibitors result in ≥1.25‐fold increase to &lt;2‐fold increase in AUC values. Our data indicate that a weak interaction with CYP3A4 occurred at both 100 and 300 mg doses of evacetrapib, whereas the AUC ratios for CYP2C9 ranged from 0.85 to 1.06, indicating minimal interaction with CYP2C9. Thus, these studies suggested a low risk of clinically relevant DDIs between evacetrapib and CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 substrates that may be taken as concomitant medications. Furthermore, since the most potent observed  in vitro K 
 i  value was associated with CYP2C9, and given that the DDI study indicated that evacetrapib is unlikely to cause clinically significant interactions requiring dose adjustments of co‐medications metabolized by CYP3A4 or CYP2C9, it can be concluded that clinically significant inhibition of the other CYP enzymes with less potent  K 
 i  values (up to 7.6 µ m  for CYP2C19) is unlikely. The potential for CYP3A‐mediated DDIs was also investigated in the anticipated dyslipidaemic patient population for evacetrapib, which includes patients with high‐risk vascular disease taking concomitant therapies such as statins. The subsequent phase 2 study in patients demonstrated that evacetrapib had minimal impact on the steady‐state AUC of simvastatin. Co‐administration of simvastatin with evacetrapib resulted in a mean statin AUC ratio of 1.25, relative to administering the statin alone. Evacetrapib also had only a very limited effect on the parent : metabolite concentration ratio. Phase 2 safety data showed that 12‐week therapy with daily doses of evacetrapib up to 500 mg as monotherapy or evacetrapib 100 mg in combination with simvastatin was well tolerated. No evidence of any adverse effect of evacetrapib on hepatic or muscle safety emerged during the active treatment phase. In their analysis of the phase 2 study database, Nicholls  et al . reported that evacetrapib was well tolerated  9 . Although their analysis was underpowered to rule out uncommon adverse effects, these investigators did not detect any clinically significant side effects or laboratory abnormalities related to liver, kidney or muscle toxicity. Although our  in vitro  data suggested that evacetrapib has the potential to affect multiple CYPs, several factors may account for the mild interactions observed in clinical studies. First, when one considers the high plasma protein binding of evacetrapib (≥99.9%)  20  and low unbound fraction in the circulation, the likelihood of a clinically significant DDI is reduced. Secondly, the  in vitro  data suggested that evacetrapib is potentially only a weak time‐dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4  in vivo . Evacetrapib is also an inducer of CYP3A and thus possesses potentially offsetting inductive and inhibitory properties. Although evacetrapib showed the potential to induce CYP3A  in vitro , the potential to produce clinically relevant  in vivo  induction of CYP3A catalytic activity over the concentration range examined was low due to the apparent dual inducing and inhibiting effects of evacetrapib on CYP3A mRNA and enzyme activity. Such normalization appears to translate into a low risk of clinically meaningful DDIs. Other examples of marketed drugs thought to have similar mechanisms of dual inhibition and induction of CYP3A observed  in vitro , which presumably offsets the clinical significance, are tadalafil  15  and ritonavir  21 . In conclusion, the initial  in vitro  data predicted that evacetrapib could be an inhibitor of multiple CYP enzymes and could be an inducer of CYP3A. The CYP3A4 inhibition potential was further supported by using updated models to predict the likelihood of DDI. However, well designed clinical studies with probe substrates selected on the basis of  in vitro  risk assessment tools and modelling approaches suggested that there was no evidence of any clinically relevant DDI with evacetrapib as the perpetrator drug. Furthermore, there was no evidence of adverse effects of evacetrapib on liver or muscle safety when given as monotherapy or in combination with simvastatin, nor were there any statistically or clinically significant effects of evacetrapib on mean change from baseline in liver or muscle‐related laboratory parameters. Evacetrapib minimally impacted exposure of simvastatin, which suggests that dose adjustments of this concomitant medication, or other CYP3A substrates, will not be warranted and that interactions with drugs cleared through this pathway are unlikely. Furthermore, atorvastatin was included in the phase 2 study, as a comparator drug, in which evacetrapib also had minimal effect on its exposure (data not shown). Overall, the present studies support the conclusion that the risk of clinically relevant CYP‐mediated DDIs is low with evacetrapib at the likely prescribed dose level in the intended patient population.

    <Body>Antipsychotics are an important and frequently used treatment option for patients with schizophrenia. During treatment patients need to be monitored to determine effectiveness and safety, therefore total drug treatment costs also include the costs of patient monitoring. In this study we assess the proportion of patient monitoring as a part of antipsychotic treatment costs in patients with schizophrenia. All oral formulations of antipsychotic agents with a European or Dutch marketing authorization and available in the Netherlands in April 2014 were included in this study. Patient monitoring instructions vary among antipsychotic drugs and were found in the most recent Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) at the website of the Dutch Medicines Evaluation Board or European Medicines Agency by searching on the generic name  1 . Patient monitoring was defined as a statement to do something prior to or during drug treatment, including measurements of (possible) side effects and comorbidities. Instructions mentioned in multiple sections of the SmPC were combined. Monitoring instructions for combinations of drugs, intoxications or directed specifically at either newborns or pregnant women were excluded. The decision to prescribe antipsychotics depends on the evidence, experience and known safety for these specific patient populations. Monitoring during intoxications depends on the severity of the intoxication and is not of influence during regular treatment. Confirmation of contraindications was not regarded as monitoring. Based on the wording of each instruction, the requirement for monitoring was determined as ‘mandatory’ or ‘advised’. Whether monitoring was directed at all patients or a specific patient population was assessed. The monitoring frequency was determined based on the information provided. When missing, a minimum of once and maximum of four times a year was used based on consensus of the authors. Monitoring that is solely performed by observation was not incorporated into the analysis. These parameters are expected to be assessed during regular visits and would not result in additional differences in costs. Total drug treatment costs were determined as the sum of drug costs and patient monitoring costs. Drug costs were acquired from the Dutch Healthcare Institute website by selecting the lowest price using the Defined Daily Dose during one year of treatment including the pharmacy dispensing fee (€12 for a first and €6 for a repeat dispensing)  2 . Unit prices for laboratory tests were obtained using the reference prices from the Dutch Healthcare Authority (NZA) 2014 including laboratory order costs (€11) per point of time  3 . Costs for physical tests were calculated based on costs for the specific test or for a consultation with a general specialist or medical specialist  3 ,  4 . Costs for a consultation were obtained using the Dutch guidelines for cost research, methods and standard price units for economic evaluations in health care  4 . Reference prices for outpatient clinics were based on a consultation in a general hospital  4 . Marked variations in the proportion of patient monitoring within antipsychotic drug treatment costs are shown in Table  1  (range 0–83%). Mean drug treatments costs were €461 (range €100–€1660) per drug per year, with proportion of mandatory monitoring costs &gt;20% among 37% of the antipsychotics. A proportion of 0% and 0–20% was found for 47% and 16% of the antipsychotics, respectively. The proportion of patient monitoring costs was highest for olanzapine (83%; €230/€277), clozapine (70%; €412/€590) and risperidone (47%; €47/€100). For some antipsychotics the share of mandatory monitoring is low; however, advised monitoring and monitoring for specific patient groups can lead to additional costs. For example, for aripiprazole, monitoring costs range from €47 to €187 for patients with diabetes or bipolar mania. Patient monitoring instructions with the highest cost impacts were consultations with a medical specialist (€64, e.g. for an ophthalmic examination) or a general practitioner (€28, e.g. for a physical examination). Additionally, electrocardiograms (€33) and blood glucose measurements (€8) had an influential share in monitoring costs.

The minimal proportion of patient monitoring costs is calculated by dividing the minimal costs for mandatory patient monitoring by the total drug treatment costs. Total drug costs consisted of &gt;20% mandatory monitoring costs for over one‐third of all antipsychotics based on minimal required patient monitoring. The proportion of patient monitoring costs may increase when patents expire, as the average price of the drugs then declines. Total drug treatment costs can be greatly influenced by mandatory and recommended monitoring instructions and may differ among specific patient groups. The proportion of monitoring costs within total drug costs is shown for patient monitoring of antipsychotics in The Netherlands. This principle is generalizable to other medicines and countries where monitoring is of importance. Due to the high share of patient monitoring costs, we advocate the use of total drug treatment costs in decision making for clinical practice.

    <Body>What is already known about this subject 
 Women generally have a higher risk for adverse drug reactions (ADRs) being reported than men. Information about possible sex differences is inconsistent and incomplete at the specific drug and ADR level. More knowledge on sex differences in ADRs is needed to tailor drug treatment and management in clinical practice. 
 What this study adds 
 Drugs with a higher risk for ADRs being reported for women included thyroid hormones, tumour necrosis factor‐α inhibitors and several psychoanaleptics. A higher risk of specific ADRs being reported was shown for both women and men for statins and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. 
 1 INTRODUCTION Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are common in clinical practice. A study using data from medical records showed that 12% of a randomly selected sample of adults from the general public in Sweden had an ADR in a 3‐month period of any of the drugs they used. 1  Higher numbers of ADRs have been shown in studies using self‐reported data. For instance, around 25% of patients in primary care in Boston reported an ADR in a survey two weeks after receiving drug prescription by their physician. 2  There may be various explanations for differences in ADR rates between studies including differences in data collection methods and ADR definitions. In general, however, the numbers indicate a point of concern since ADRs may be bothersome and may reduce treatment adherence, efficacy, quality of life and increase healthcare costs. 3 ,  4 ,  5 
 Many factors may influence the occurrence of ADRs 6  including sex. It has been shown that women have a 1.5–1.7 times higher risk for ADRs than men. 7  However, information is inconsistent and incomplete at the specific drug and ADR level. For instance, 1 study showed that men reported more ADRs to antineoplastic drugs than women, 8  whereas another study showed that women reported more ADRs to antineoplastic drugs than men. 9  Recently, a study assessed sex differences in drug‐event combinations using the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System. 10  The study showed significant differences between men and women in drug‐event combination frequency distributions in 307 of the 668 assessed drugs but did not take sex differences in the number of drug users into account. Previous studies showed that a higher proportion of women use drugs than men, that women use different drugs, and that women use more drugs than men. 11 ,  12 ,  13 ,  14 
 More knowledge on sex differences in ADRs is needed to tailor drug treatment and management in clinical practice. The primary aim of this study was to assess the extent of possibly relevant sex differences in drug–ADR combinations reported to a pharmacovigilance centre, taking sex differences in the number of drug users into account. The secondary aims of this study were to assess for which drugs and for which ADRs sex differences were identified most often. 2 METHODS 2.1 Study design and data sources We conducted an explorative observational study to identify possibly relevant sex differences in ADRs related to specific drugs. Data on these drug–ADR combinations for individual patients that are reported to the Netherlands pharmacovigilance centre Lareb from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2016 were used. Healthcare professionals (HCPs) as well as patients are allowed to report ADRs to Lareb, 15 ,  16  which is funded by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport, and the Dutch Medicines Evaluation Board. All ADR reports related to drugs submitted to Lareb from patients, physicians and pharmacists, concerning patients aged between 5 and 99 years old were included (Figure  1 ). Figure 1 Flowchart of the number of drug–adverse drug reaction (ADR) combinations.  1  Anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) classification system codes (number of combinations): B02BD (1); B06AA (1); J01GB (1); J01XB (1); L01CD (8); L01XA (13); L01XC (12); L04 AC (1); N02AJ (6); N07BA (23); P01BB (16); R01AA (2); S01JA (1).  2  ATC codes (number of combinations): B03AC (16); G02BA (37); G02BB (10); G03AA (46); G03 AC (10); G03 AD (1); G03CA (10); G03HB (18); L02BG (8).  3  ATC codes (number of combinations): G04BE (2); G04CB (2)  4  medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA) preferred level terms (number of combinations): ejaculation disorder (2); ejaculation failure (1); erectile dysfunction (15); gynaecomastia (7); priapism (1)  5  MedDRA terms (number of combinations): amenorrhoea (1); female orgasmic disorder (1); menopausal symptoms (1); menstrual disorder (1); menstruation irregular (1); metrorrhagia (1); vaginal haemorrhage (1); vulvovaginal burning sensation (1); vulvovaginal candidiasis (1); vulvovaginal pruritus (1) Data from the Drug Information System of the National Health Care Institute were used to retrieve the total number of women and men using the specific drugs in the study period. 17  These data are based on reimbursement of drugs being used in an ambulatory setting, which are available for women and men aged between 5 and 99 years old. 2.2 Outcome variable The outcome variables used in this study were specific drug–ADR combinations. Drugs mentioned in the ADR report were classified according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system. 18  In this system, drugs are divided on five different levels based on the organ or system on which they act and their chemical, pharmacological, and therapeutic properties. For the specific drug assessment, drugs on the chemical subgroup, the fourth ATC level was used. Reported ADRs were classified according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), version 20.0. 19  The MedDRA is a medical dictionary that contains five levels ranging from very general (the System Organ Class level) to very specific terms (the Lowest Level Term level). The fourth, preferred term (PT) level was used for the ADR assessment which is the level most often used in safety reporting for analysis. 20  The use of the PT level implies that a report containing several ADRs on the lowest level of detail but within the same PT were counted once. 2.3 Determinant The determinant used in this study was the sex (i.e. women  vs  men) of the patients for which an ADR was reported. Reports indicating that sex was unknown were excluded. 2.4 Analyses Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the reports. Sex differences in specific drug–ADR combinations were assessed for combinations mentioned in at least 10 reports (Figure  1 ). This number was arbitrarily chosen as being appropriate for detection of all possibly relevant sex differences in drug–ADR combinations. Duplicate reports (i.e. those reported by both patients and HCPs) were counted only once. For both women and men, the number of users was calculated per drug resulting in the total number of users in the study period. Drug–ADR combinations for which the total number of men or the total number of women using the drug in the population over the 14‐year study period was &lt;10 000 were excluded. Sex‐specific ADRs as labelled in the Gender Adverse Event Term Lists of the MedDRA 21  were also excluded (Figure  1 ). Sex differences in the remaining specific drug–ADR combinations were tested using bivariate logistic regression analyses in which the number of users of the specific drug in the study period was taken into account. In these analyses, our total population consisted of all users of the specific drug in the study period with the number of individuals experiencing the ADR being the number of reports received in the study period. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for each specific drug–ADR combination, and associations with  P ‐values &lt;.05 are reported. Since the aim was to identify all possibly relevant sex differences, the results were not adjusted for multiple testing. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the agreement of the findings between the patient and HCP reports. For this, the patient and HCP reports were analysed separately. All analyses were conducted using Stata version 13 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA) and Microsoft Excel 2010 was used for a graphical presentation of the results. 3 RESULTS In the study period, there were 80 118 ADR reports in which 268 584 drug–ADR combinations were reported. These concerned 50 293 distinct drug–ADR combinations (Figure  1 ). After exclusion of reports, there were 42 855 ADR reports who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Two thirds of these reports (67%) concerned women. The mean ± standard deviation age in the reports concerning women was 51 ± 18 years and for men 56 ± 18 years. In total, 80 049 drug–ADR combinations were reported, which concerned 2765 distinct drug–ADR combinations (Figure  1 ). 3.1 Sex differences in specific drug–ADR combinations Of the 2765 distinct drug–ADR combinations, 246 combinations were excluded because the number of drug users in the study period was &lt;10 000. Another 36 combinations were excluded because of a sex‐specific ADR (Figure  1 ). Among the remaining 2483 combinations there were 103 drug–ADR combinations (4%) reported for 1 sex only. A possibly relevant sex difference was shown in 363 combinations (15%), which concerned 74 different drugs and 124 different ADRs. In most of these cases (89%), women had a higher odds ratio for a specific drug–ADR combination than men (322  vs  41 combinations). The results of all 2483 combinations are presented in  Data S1 . For some drugs and ADRs, a multitude of sex differences were shown. Most common drugs with a multitude of ADRs for which women had higher odds were: thyroid hormones (ATC group H03AA; 32 combinations); centrally acting sympathomimetics (N06BA; 16 combinations); other antidepressants (N06AX; 14 combinations); and tumour necrosis factor‐α inhibitors (L04AB; 14 combinations). The most common ADRs with a multitude of differences with higher odds for women were: nausea (32 combinations); alopecia (28 combinations); headache (20 combinations); dizziness (18 combinations); and palpitations (18 combinations). Higher odds for men were particularly shown in combinations with the following ADRs: aggression; death; pyrexia; sexual dysfunction; tendon rupture; and tinnitus (all in 2 combinations). Drugs for which a higher odds ratio was shown for a multitude of ADRs in both men and women, were β‐hydroxy β‐methylglutaryl (HMG)‐CoA reductase inhibitors (C10AA; 20 combinations with higher odds for women and 5 combinations with higher odds for men), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (N06AB; 13 combinations with higher odds for women and 10 combinations with higher odds for men). The type of ADRs for HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (range for women: OR 7.23, 95% CI 1.62–32.29 for swollen tongue to OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.05–2.27 for palpitations; range for men: OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01–0.34 for libido decreased to OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.19–0.98 for pancreatitis; Figure  2 ) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (range for women: OR 6.19, 95% CI 1.91–20.06 for haematoma to OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.12–2.47 for nausea; range for men: OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06–0.83 for micturition disorder to OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.45–0.85 for therapeutic response unexpected; Figure  3 ) with higher odds for men were different than the ADRs with higher odds for women.

For the sensitivity analysis, 537 drug–ADR combinations were tested using both the patient and HCP reports. Agreement in significance was shown in 397 drug–ADR combinations (74%; Figure  S2 ).

 4 DISCUSSION We found that 15% of approximately 2500 drug–ADR combinations reported to the pharmacovigilance centre showed a possibly relevant difference in occurrence of ADRs between women and men after taking sex differences in drug use into account. In 89% of these cases, the risk was higher for women than for men. Drugs with a multitude of ADRs showing a higher risk for women included thyroid hormones, tumour necrosis factor‐α inhibitors and several psychoanaleptics. A higher risk of specific ADRs for both women and men was shown for HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (women: e.g. alopecia and headache; men: e.g. decreased libido and tendon rupture) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (women: e.g. dizziness and nausea; men: e.g. aggression and sexual dysfunction). In general, several specific ADRs were more often reported for either women or men across a range of drugs, including nausea, alopecia and headache for women, and aggression, sexual dysfunction and tendon rupture for men. Our study confirms findings from previous studies demonstrating that women have a higher risk for reporting ADRs than men (e.g. 7 ,  8 ,  12 ,  22 ,  23 ,  24 ,  25 ,  26 ). It adds to this knowledge by presenting an overview of this higher risk for specific drug–ADR combinations. Moreover, it shows that men may have a higher risk for other specific drug–ADR combinations. Compared to other studies, our study assessed drugs and ADRs at a specific level and took sex differences in drug prescribing into account. Previous studies analysing ADRs at system organ class level showed for instance a higher risk for women in cardiac disorders 26  and a higher risk for men in renal and urinary disorders. 10  According to the current study, the higher risk for women seems to apply particularly to palpitations and the higher risk for men to haematuria, micturition disorder and pollakiuria (Figure  S3 ). Observed differences in the type and number of reported ADRs can be caused by sex‐ or gender‐related factors. Sex‐related factors refer to biological differences between women and men, whereas gender‐related factors refer to psychosocial, behavioural or cultural differences. 27  Sex‐related differences that are relevant for the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic behaviour of drugs include differences in physiology, genetic expression, immunological processes, and type and function of various hormones. 28 ,  29 ,  30 ,  31 ,  32 ,  33  For instance, women generally have a lower body weight. Therefore, one would expect more so‐called type A ADRs in women. Type A reactions are dose dependent, occur frequently, have a low mortality, and can be explained based on the pharmacological properties of the drug. 34  In clinical practice, some sex‐specific dose adjustments are recommended or used. For example, in the case of zolpidem, where women have a lower clearance than men, lower doses are recommended and prescribed for women. 35 ,  36  In the current study, several of the common type A ADRs, such as nausea, headache and dizziness, were indeed predominantly present in women. However, no significant differences in reported ADRs for drugs with known differences in pharmacological properties, such as benzodiazepines or verapamil were observed. 37 ,  38  For some drug classes such as β‐blocking agents, specific ADRs (e.g. palpitations) occurred more in women whereas other ADRs (e.g. coldness) occurred more in men. ADRs are classified as type B reactions if these cannot be explained by pharmacological properties of the drug, which occur less frequently and are often more serious in nature. In the current study, some of the ADRs that were more present in men, may be type B reactions, such as aggression and tendon ruptures. However, these differences could also be explained by differences in background incidence of the  phenomenon  as tendon ruptures and aggression occur more frequently in men than in women without using drugs. Besides sex‐related factors, differences in social roles, lifestyle factors, communication styles, health information‐seeking behaviour, and medication prescribing and adherence could also lead to gender‐specific differences in the occurrence, perception and reporting of ADRs. Some ADRs are more likely to be perceived or reported by either women or men, since the burden may depend on gender specific self‐image. An example is the occurrence of hair loss, which is more common in aging men than in aging women. 39 ,  40 ,  41  Therefore, alopecia that occurs or is perceived as an ADR is likely to be considered as more disturbing in women than in men, which may explain more reports in women in the current study. Reporting ADRs requires that the patient assigns signs or symptoms to a drug. Women and men may perceive these differently. 42  Women appear to search more actively for health information than men. 43 ,  44  Patients can either report by themselves or contact their healthcare professional who can decide to report. To our knowledge, possible sex differences in respect to ADR reporting behaviour have not been widely studied. It is known that there is underreporting of ADRs in spontaneous reporting 45  but it seems that sex of the patient is not a factor for healthcare professionals in decision making whether or not to report an ADR to the pharmacovigilance centre. 46 ,  47  Moreover, there seem to be no differences in reasons for and opinions about ADR reporting between female and male patients who report to a pharmacovigilance centre. 48  Our study contained reports of both patients and HCPs. Separate analyses of the patient and HCP reports showed similar sex differences in drug–ADR combinations (Figure  S2 ), suggesting that the observed differences are not due to sex differences in spontaneous reporting behaviour. The occurrence of ADRs is clearly related to drug exposure. In the analyses, the number of drug users was taken into account, but individual drug exposure is dependent on medication prescribing and adherence behaviour. There can be differences in the dose or duration of drugs prescribed to women as compared to men. For example, women are more often prescribed a low‐dose of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors at treatment initiation than men who are more often prescribed the standard dose. 49  Also, women may receive more co‐prescriptions, which could lead to a higher risk for ADRs. 50  Previous studies are inconsistent about sex differences in adherence levels. 51 
 To summarize, it is likely that both sex‐related and sex‐related factors may underlie the observed differences between women and men in drug–ADR combinations as reported to the pharmacovigilance centre. The distinction between sex‐ and sex‐related factors, however, is not straightforward since they are correlated and can influence each other. 52 ,  53 ,  54  Further in‐depth studies are needed for the specific drug–ADR combinations with possibly relevant sex differences to assess the individual contribution of potential factors. A strength of this study is the assessment of differences between women and men for all reported drug–ADR combinations while taking differences in the number of drug users into account. Trained assessors at the pharmacovigilance centre classified the ADRs using the MedDRA terms system. ADRs were analysed at the PT level to reduce possible inconsistent coding at the lowest level. There are also some limitations that need to be acknowledged. We combined all ADR reports and the number of drug users per sex in the study period. Due to this aggregated level, we were not able to adjust for potential confounding factors at individual level, such as age. Therefore, we cannot make inferences at individual patient level. The number of drug users was based on data of reimbursed drugs prescribed in an ambulatory setting. This implies that drugs prescribed in another setting or used over‐the‐counter were not included. Furthermore, we analysed drugs at the chemical subgroup level of the ATC system but not all drugs that belong to a specific chemical subgroup can be considered as pharmacotherapeutically equivalent. Therefore, some relevant sex differences in ADRs may have been missed at the lowest level of the ATC system. However, a study assessing the heterogeneity of drugs within ATC classes showed that the mechanism of action and physiological effects of drugs in most classes were fairly homogeneous. 55  Another limitation is the difference in number of cases for drug–ADR combinations (ranging from 10 to 1992), yielding differences in power. Moreover, some combinations were reported for either women or men only, but this mainly occurred for drugs with a higher number of users in women or men, respectively. Finally, the study was conducted using spontaneously reported ADRs to the pharmacovigilance centre in the Netherlands. Since cultural differences between men and women may influence the spontaneous reporting of ADRs, it is unknown to what extent the results are generalizable to other countries. In conclusion, this study showed possibly relevant differences between women and men in 15% of the assessed drug–ADR combinations spontaneously reported to a pharmacovigilance centre. Both sex‐ and gender‐related factors may play a role in explaining the observed differences in ADRs. COMPETING INTERESTS The authors have no competing interests to declare.

    <Body>1 INTRODUCTION The global increase in life expectancy is unquestionably a unique achievement of growing wealth, improved hygienic standards and advances in the provision of healthcare services realizing a declining mortality in acute and chronic diseases through diagnostics, surgery, pharmacotherapy and other interventions. However, increasing life expectancy does not come without new challenges for effective patient care, whereas these challenges in turn may provide opportunities for developing new concepts further supporting longevity and quality of life. Following a conference of experts from different disciplines in Graz (Austria) on November 7–8, 2017, entitled “Medicines for older adults: getting prepared for the scientific and regulator revolutions,” this themed issue was born to provide insights to a wider audience of stakeholders into the complexity, but also the opportunity, of senior adapted, that is, senior friendly patient care. The themed issue is dedicated to an interdisciplinary review of the challenges of prescribing and dispensing medicines to older people as well as the difficulties that older and multimorbid patients may face when managing their medication regimens. It further includes a review of emerging technologies that might better serve the needs of future patient populations and is complemented by the progress in regulation on frailty and the pharmaceutical development of medicines for older people. 2 OLD AND VERY OLD AGE At present, patients aged 80 years and beyond are the norm rather than the exception in community and hospital care. As described by Roller‐Wirnsberger et al., the increasing prevalence of acute and chronic diseases and multimorbidity with older age are important determinants for disabilities affecting older people's well‐being and independence. 
 1 
  However, recent studies have shown two contradicting trends. People are living longer in better health and their quality of life conditions are better than those of earlier generations. 
 2 
  Yet at the same time, the most recent generations seem to be affected by multimorbidity at younger ages than the generations before. 
 3 
 ,  
 4 
  Even though there is growing awareness that multimorbidity is becoming a major challenge for the future, 
 5 
 ,  
 6 
 ,  
 7 
  the complexity of treating multimorbid older patients is still underestimated because they even differ more from the single disease and young patients for whom the drug product had proven to be beneficial during the pharmaceutical and clinical development of a new drug. 
 8 
 
 3 POLYPHARMACY In many cases, disciplinary guidelines require the simultaneous prescription of 2 and more drugs for chronic diseases. This implies that patients from two chronic diseases may already be on polypharmacy, which is defined as the use of 5 drugs or more. However, prescription guidelines are commonly based on a single disease concept and might not reflect the inter‐connected factors on co‐administered drugs for other chronic diseases, self‐medicated drugs, nutritional products, as well as disease or age‐related physiological changes. 
 9 
  This is especially true in increasingly older patients of whom more than 80% are exposed chronically or periodically to polypharmacy. 
 10 
  Strampelli et al. reviewed the top 10 prescriptions in older people by ATC level, age‐subset, and gender across four representative European countries including more than 40 million prescriptions. 
 11 
  The data revealed that certain drugs or drug classes are regularly prescribed to up to every second older patient. Therefore, the use of these commonly prescribed drugs has to be considered during any prescribing, dispensing or drug development (both for new innovator as well as new generic drug products). 4 ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS Adverse drug reactions (ADR) in patients aged 65 years and beyond account for up to 30% of emergency department admissions 
 12 
 ,  
 13 
 ,  
 14 
  of which the majority would be preventable. 
 15 
 ,  
 16 
  Reasons for medication related problems in older and multimorbid patients are polypharmacy, 
 17 
  drug‐drug, drug‐disease, drug‐food and drug‐herbal medicines interactions, 
 18 
  therapeutic failures, adverse drug withdrawal events 
 19 
  and prescribing of potentially inappropriate medications. 
 20 
  In addition, the treatment goals might change for the individual patient with increasing age which implies the need to consider the time‐to‐benefit 
 21 
  and deprescribing. 
 22 
  For patients in the terminal life stage, treatment objectives might shift even more to Quality‐of‐Life aspects and a stronger focus on the treatment of symptoms rather than the disease itself. 
 23 
  The current demographic transition inevitably leads to patients with a higher degree of clinical and therapeutic complexity, which affects the prescribing by healthcare professionals as described by Drenth‐Van Maanen et al. 
 24 
  and the necessary deprescribing challenge as described by Shrestha et al. 
 25 
 
 5 DRUG PRODUCT INTERFACE AND MEDICATION ERRORS The interface between the user (patient, lay caregiver, professional caregiver, health care professional) and the drug product is of great importance. This interface includes how the user understands the product, can handle the product in a given setting and executes its administration while taking into account the administration recommendations for other drug products that may need to be handled concurrently. Practical medication problems and even medication administration errors can thus occur at the level of professional care 
 26 
  as well as the patient or its lay caregiver. The problems and errors are often caused by product and process related factors. 
 27 
  In order to explore real‐world evidence on practical medication problems and errors and the possibilities for risk mitigation through the drug product design, Karapinar‐Çarkit et al. evaluated the incidents reported to a public Dutch medication incident registry. 
 28 
 
 Recently, patient centric pharmaceutical drug product development has been defined as a means to reduce the risk for medication (administration) errors. 
 29 
  In order to better understand this voice, Schenk et al. investigated the typical real‐world behaviour of older patients interfacing with their medications when managing complex therapeutic regimens on their own. 
 30 
 
 6 DRUG PRODUCT PREPARATION BEFORE ADMINISTRATION The patient product interface relies on physical, sensory, and cognitive capabilities of individuals. Their suitability for the intended handling may differ among patients and is commonly most critical in older people due to impaired human and organ functions. In a study by van Riet‐Nales et al., a test battery was established that intended to understand which human functions such as vision, dexterity, grip strength and coordination are most critical to tablet breaking as older people commonly reported difficulties on this handling. 
 31 
 
 Sufficient function with respect to dexterity, grip strength and coordination is also required to release tablets from a product carton or blister, which is an essential handling prior to taking a tablet (part). All this was investigated by Braun‐Münker et al. in a comparative study with different packaging designs. In order to administer the product according to the recommended instructions, Ecker concluded that a certain degree of planning and memory is essential. 
 32 
 
 Methodologies and assessment instruments to evaluate the interface of the product and patient is an emerging science to assure that the product is acceptable and fit for use by the patient, caregiver and/or health care professional. For medical devices, human factor design principles have already been implemented in the past. 
 33 
 ,  
 34 
  Feufel et al. provide insights into the human factor approach in the healthcare environment. 
 35 
  This approach includes several cycles of user tests to remove potential sources of errors and to optimize the ergonomics for a safe and appropriate use of devices so that adaptations can be made to support the usability of drug products. 7 INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY The development of information and communication technology (ICT) in recent years has created a new level of networking between healthcare professionals and patients and in particular the interaction between patients and physicians. 
 36 
  Eggerth et al. summarizes the actual status of progress in this emerging field of science such as diagnostic sensors connected to a smartphone in order to provide physicians with real time health parameters. 
 37 
 ,  
 38 
  By effectively and continuously monitoring health parameters in patients, the service providers will be able to focus on preventive and proactive therapeutic measures by physicians rather than reactive measures in the event of a health crisis. Implementing ICT in healthcare provision will provide valuable manners of diagnosing, monitoring and treating older and multimorbid patients with limited mobility due to its time and location independent patient access to physicians. However, information safety requires continuous attention as unintended access to data (hacking) may result in incorrect medical decision making and/or break confidentiality. 8 REGULATIONS ON DRUG DEVELOPMENT Before a drug product can be put on the market by industry, regulatory authorities have thoroughly reviewed the scientific data to evaluate and judge the benefit to risk for the target patient population. Since drugs are prescribed and not purchased by patient decision, for many years, the pharmaceutical product development focused on the provision of the correct dose through a product with acceptable physico‐chemical product aspects compliant with regulatory quality requirements. 
 39 
  The emerging awareness of the patient factor as an important contributor to achieve the therapeutic outcomes has gained increased awareness among regulatory bodies, including the need to reflect and discuss about the consequence for future drug development. van Riet‐Nales describes the new (draft) reflections on the pharmaceutical development of medicines for use in the older population. 
 40 
  The paper suggest that regulatory authorities will continue to increasingly request the direct involvement of target patient populations in the pharmaceutical drug development and shift their view to realizing drug products of good and consistent quality that are fit for use in real world conditions. 
 41 
 ,  
 42 
 
 9 REGULATIONS ON FRAILTY Clinical studies are the basis for drug approval and the labelling claims. The clinical evidence generated is often limited to randomized patient populations and exclusion of the older and multimorbid patient populations. 
 43 
  The disproportionality between the study population and the major patient population using the drug after approval remains a major limitation for the clinical evidence under real‐world conditions. 
 8 
  Despite the ICH E7 guideline, van Marum et al. shows the problem remains to exist. 
 44 
  To resolve the issues with clinical trials in older patients, regulatory guidelines have been put forward 
 45 
  accompanied by practical guidance to perform such trials with older patients. 
 46 
  In this themed issue, Francesca Cerreta focused on the harmonization of evaluation instruments for the increasing population of the frail patients. 10 VIEWS FROM INDUSTRY While progress is being made to address the arising challenges of the demographic evolution, the implementation into new drug development programs will require substantial changes: These changes cannot be achieved by the pharmaceutical industry alone as drug development is a highly regulated and step‐wise process including many stakeholders in order to mitigate the immanent risk of the unknown. Timpe et al. provide insights into the remaining challenges for industry and describe the attempts of the pharmaceutical industry to balance the benefits and risks of a new drug development program against fast access of innovative medicines to all patients and patient populations around the world. 
 47 
 
 11 CONCLUSION Already in 1960, advances in healthcare and growing life expectancy were predicted to result in unaffordability and a crisis of the healthcare system. 
 48 
  Over the past 60 years however, the new challenges arising from demographic changes and new treatments have been managed through their improved therapeutic outcomes and innovation in healthcare provision. A recent study showed that the age‐related disease burden expressed as disease adjusted life years (DALYs) is declining worldwide and that differences can be attributed to certain healthcare policies. 
 49 
  The opportunities for the healthcare system therefore lie in the continuous adaptation to the emerging patient populations and the use of new drugs as well as technologies with the aim of achieving optimal therapeutic success through the efficient use of the increasing therapeutic options. This will include intensive collaboration and synthesis of the various disciplines through expert collaboration across the different stakeholders that are supported by the common goal. In contrast to the increasing clinical complexity of the multimorbid that cannot be changed, the therapeutic complexity can be reduced by the pharmaceutical drug product development. Designing pharmaceutical drug products that do not rely on lengthy and varying administration instructions instead follow patients learned and intuitive use of, for example, an oral dosage form by a higher degree of standardization will simplify the therapy management. Performing usability studies with typical final presentations of pharmaceutical drug products based on the principles derived from human factor design and usability engineering applied in medical device development help to identify and resolve unnecessary use issues build into the product at the development stages. Emerging digital technologies offer additional opportunities in advancing patient care in the multimorbid as well as old and very old patient population. With the contributions of experts from the different disciplines, this themed issue want to provide evidence about the challenges and opportunities for pharmaceutical care providers in the aging population as well as encourage broader multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary discussions to improve the pharmaceutical care and quality of life of the old, very old and multimorbid patient population.

    <Body>What is Already Known about this Subject 
 Amisulpride is an atypical antipsychotic approved for the treatment of acute and chronic psychoses. Overdoses of amisulpride are known to have effects on cardiac repolarization and the assessment of the potential for the drug to prolong the QT interval when administered intravenously remains to be elucidated. Much lower doses than those used to treat psychoses have been shown to be effective at preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting when given intravenously. 
 What this Study Adds 
 At the therapeutic dose of 5 mg amisulpride, the attained  C 
 max  was comparable to the optimum plasma concentrations to treat psychoses using higher oral doses. The proposed therapeutic dose of 5 mg amisulpride given over 2 min does not prolong QTc interval. A supratherapeutic dose of 8 times higher than the therapeutic dose infused at double the rate led to ΔΔQTcF prolongation of 23.4 ms at the end of infusion and to a  C 
 max  concentration of 1305.44 ng ml −1 , similar to the largest available oral presentation of amisulpride.

 Introduction Amisulpride is a substituted benzamide that acts as a selective antagonist of dopamine D 2  and D 3  receptors  4 . It was introduced in the 1980s as an ‘atypical’ antipsychotic and has been approved in many countries for the treatment of acute and chronic psychoses at a dose range between 50 and 1200 mg per day, given orally or intramuscularly  5 ,  6 . The overall safety profile of amisulpride at its approved doses has been assessed in numerous clinical studies with no evidence of cardiac toxicity  6 ,  7 ,  8 . However, very large overdoses of oral amisulpride have been associated with the development of torsade de pointes (TdP)  9 ,  10 ,  11 ,  12 ,  13  and there is a solitary case report in the literature suggesting that TdP may have been caused by a low oral dose of 100 mg day −1  in a patient with a low body mass index  14 . In  in vitro  testing, amisulpride has been shown to have a low potential for blockade of the cardiac hERG channel, with a high IC 50  value of approximately 100 μM for inhibition of the repolarizing delayed rectifier potassium current, I Kr , and less than 20% displacement of [ 3 H]‐astemizole binding  15 . Amisulpride has also been shown to bind to Na V 1.5 and the effects of late I Na  blockade ability have been suggested to reduce the impact on QT interval due to hERG blockade  16 . QT response may differ between ethnic groups and this may be attributable to inter‐ethnic differences in the frequency of variant alleles of the genes SCN5A, KCNH2, KCNE2, KCNQ1 and KCNE1 encoding for the sodium channel Na V 1.5 and four potassium channels respectively  17 ,  18 ,  19 . Recently, an intravenous (i.v.) dose of 5 mg amisulpride was shown to be superior to placebo at preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting  20 . As part of the clinical development programme for amisulpride, we conducted a specifically designed Thorough QT/QTc (TQT) study, in accordance with the ICH E14 guideline, in order to quantify the effect of i.v. amisulpride on the QTc interval at the therapeutic dose proposed for PONV management and at an eight‐fold supratherapeutic dose. Additionally, the study compared the PK‐QTc relationship in two ethnic groups: Caucasian and Japanese. Methods The study was given a positive opinion by an authorized Research Ethics Committee (NRES Committee South Central – Berkshire B, ref: 13/SC/0496), approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority and registered with EudraCT (ref: 2013‐002 669‐20) and  ClinicalTrials.gov  (ref: NCT02661594). The trial was conducted at a single centre (Richmond Pharmacology Ltd, UK) between 22 November 2013 and 31 March 2014. Its conduct was in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, current UK law and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines. Each subject received verbal and written information followed by signing of the Informed Consent Form (ICF) prior to any procedures taking place. Subjects General eligibility of 102 subjects volunteering for participation in this study was assessed at screening, which took place within 21 days of the first study drug administration. Male and female subjects were included if they were healthy, non‐smoking, Caucasian or Japanese, aged between 20 and 45 years and had a body mass index ranging between 18 and 25 kg m −2  inclusive. Subjects were excluded if they had: (i) a medical or family history of congenital long QT syndrome; (ii) a clinically significant abnormal ECG (PR consistently &lt;120 or &gt;230 ms, QRS consistently ≥120 ms, QTcB &gt;430 ms for males and &gt;450 ms for females, heart rate consistently &lt;45 beats min −1  or &gt;100 beats min −1 ); (iii) if they used any concomitant medication that impaired drug metabolizing capacity or was known to have a QT‐prolonging effect; or (iv) had any intolerance to moxifloxacin or amisulpride. Study design This was a randomized, double‐blind, placebo and positive‐controlled, four‐way crossover study using features of an adaptive study design, including the potential to add subjects depending on the standard deviation obtained during a blinded ECG review allowing the sample size to be adapted optimally to the variability occurring in this particular trial  21 . The 40 eligible subjects were randomized to one of four sequences of the four study treatments (Figure  1 ): oral moxifloxacin 400 mg (M), i.v. amisulpride 5 mg (A5), i.v. amisulpride 40 mg (A40) and i.v. normal saline as a placebo (P). The four sequences (A5‐A40‐M‐P, A40‐P‐A5‐M, P‐M‐A40‐A5 and M‐A5‐P‐A40) were balanced for period and preceding treatment (Williams squares). Each treatment period consisted of a placebo baseline day (Day −1), followed by the treatment day (Day 1). A washout period of at least seven days separated treatment periods. ECGs and blood samples for PK analysis were taken at the same time points on Days −1 and 1 of every period. Subjects attended for a follow‐up visit scheduled 7–14 days after the last dose. Figure 1 Study flow chart Intravenous study treatments were fully blinded and administered from two syringe drivers starting at the same time, one infusing 2.5 ml over 2 min, the other infusing 20 ml over 8 min. The 5 mg amisulpride dose was given as 2.5 ml of 2 mg ml −1  amisulpride over 2 min in parallel with normal saline in the other syringe driver. The 40 mg amisulpride dose was given as 20 ml of 2 mg ml −1  amisulpride over 8 min in parallel with normal saline in the other syringe driver. For the placebo treatment, both syringe drivers contained normal saline. Moxifloxacin was given unblinded as a single, commercially‐sourced, 400 mg oral tablet, preceded on Day −1 by a single, inactive moxifloxacin‐placebo tablet. ECG assessment and QTc evaluation Twelve‐lead ECGs were recorded using a MAC1200 ®  ECG recorder (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) and stored electronically on the Medical MUSE ®  information system (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). ECG recordings were made at the following time points: pre‐dose, 2, 8 and 30 min, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h post‐dose of each treatment period. Before any ECG recording, the subjects maintained an undisturbed supine resting position for at least 10 min and avoided postural changes during the ECG recordings. At each time point, the ECGs were recorded in triplicate, to reduce variance and improve the precision of measurement. Each ECG lasted 10 s. The triplicates were performed at one‐minute intervals over 3 min. The QT interval, RR interval and heart rate, PR interval and QRS duration, the presence or absence of U‐waves, quantitative and qualitative ECG variations were assessed by cardiologists with extensive experience of manual on‐screen over‐reading with electronic callipers using the commercially available MUSE ®  in its latest version to correct any implausible readings presented by the automated process. During hospitalization, subjects were served breakfast before dosing, lunch and dinner with similar nutritional composition at approximately 6 h and 12 h post‐dose, respectively. On baseline and treatment days, breakfast was identical across all periods and was served 1 h and completed 30 min prior to allocated dose administration. Statistical analysis The primary analysis was based on the crossover design of the study and used the change from average baseline of QTcF of the baseline day. For each time point, a linear mixed effects model with sequence, period, gender and race and treatment as fixed effects and baseline as covariate was adapted, with subject (nested in sequence) as a random effect. Two‐sided 90% confidence intervals for the difference between each dose of amisulpride and placebo (safety) and moxifloxacin and placebo (assay sensitivity) were derived. All subjects in the safety dataset who had valid ECG data for at least one post‐dosing time point during periods 1–4 were included in the primary analysis set. To show assay sensitivity, a Hochberg procedure was applied to the results of the 2, 3 and 4 h time points of the difference between placebo and positive control (moxifloxacin). Baseline was calculated from the Day −1 values of the respective period. Two types of baseline were used: the averaged baseline for the primary analysis and a time‐matched one for a secondary analysis. Baseline ECGs were scheduled to match the on‐treatment clock time points for each treatment period. Categorical analyses were performed to determine the number of subjects per treatment regimen and time who had values &gt;450 ms as well as an increase from baseline QTc interval ≥30 ms and ≥60 ms by gender. Furthermore, a linear concentration response model was fitted to all QTcF data in the two amisulpride groups. The placebo‐corrected change from average baseline (∆∆QTcF) was used as a dependent variable. The model had a fixed intercept and slope but random intercepts only. The absence of hysteresis was confirmed graphically. For each dose group the placebo‐corrected change from baseline in QTcF was plotted over time as well as the drug concentration of the respective dose group. If maximum ∆∆QTcF was delayed compared with the respective plasma concentration by at least 1 h, a model with an additional effect compartment was to be used to replace the mixed effects model described above. However, this replacement was only to be done if the maximal effect of amisulpride (point estimate) as estimated in the primary analysis was 5 ms or above. To assess differences between the Caucasian and Japanese subjects, a factor ethnicity and its interaction with concentration were added to the model and tested against a null hypothesis of no effect. The models were graphically presented by a regression line together with a two‐sided 90% confidence region. For the model with ethnicity, separate regression lines for Caucasians and Japanese were given. The appropriateness of a linear model was assured by inspecting the goodness of fit, for example by looking at normal QQ plots for the residuals and plots of the residuals over predicted values. If there was an indication that a linear model was inappropriate, the nonlinearity detected was to be taken into account by an appropriate transformation of the concentration values (e.g., log(conc/lloq)) or by the use of an appropriate nonlinear model. Pharmacokinetic assessments Pharmacokinetic samples were taken over a 24 h period on Day 1 of each period. Timings for pharmacokinetic blood sampling were coincident with ECG assessment time points. Plasma samples for determination of amisulpride concentration were analysed by Quotient BioAnalytical Sciences. A validated liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method with liquid–liquid extraction has been used, developed and satisfactorily validated for the measurement of amisulpride in human plasma over the calibration range 2–2000 ng ml −1  with a lower limit of quantification of 2 ng ml −1 . Validation procedures were based on those outlined in the ‘Guideline on Bioanalytical Method Validation’  22 . Chromatographic separation was performed through a Waters CSH C18 (1.7 μm, 2.1 × 50 mm, Waters Corporation, Milford, Massachusetts, USA) analytical column at 40°C, with a mobile phase consisting of 10 mM ammonium formate in 0.2% formic acid. The flow rate was 0.6 ml min −1 , and the total run time was 3 min. Detection and quantification were performed by mass spectrometry using a Sciex API5000 mass spectrometer (AB Sciex LLP, Framingham, Massachusetts, USA). The precision and accuracy (expressed as the coefficient of variation (% CV) and as the relative error (% RE) respectively) of the method was found to be within the target limits of ±20% at the lower limit of quantification and within ±15% at all other concentrations. The recovery of amisulpride from human plasma was reproducible and acceptable. The selectivity of the method was found to be satisfactory with no endogenous interference which may adversely affect the analysis. Amisulpride was found to be stable in human plasma for up to 28 h at room temperature, after four freeze–thaw cycles from −20°C and for up to 119 days stored at nominally −20°C. Amisulpride was found to be stable in whole human blood for up to 2 h at room temperature, at 30°C and at 37°C. No significant matrix effect was observed, and the method was found satisfactory for the analysis. Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed using non‐compartmental methods using SAS™ version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Buckinghamshire, UK). Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using non‐compartmental analysis of the plasma concentration–time data: observed maximum plasma concentration ( C 
 max ), time to  C 
 max  ( t 
 max ), apparent terminal half‐life ( t 
 ½ ) calculated by 0.693/λ z , area under the plasma concentration–time curve from zero to time  t  of the last measured concentration ( C 
 last ) above the limit of quantification ( AUC 
 0– t ) calculated by the linear up‐log down trapezoidal method and area under the plasma concentration–time curve from zero to infinity ( AUC 
 0–∞ ) calculated by  AUC 
 0– t  +  AUC 
 t–∞ , where  AUC 
 t–∞  is the residual area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve, extrapolated by  C 
 last /λ z . Safety assessments All adverse events (AEs) were continuously monitored throughout the study from the date informed consent was signed until the end of each subject's participation. The intensity and potential relationship with the study drugs of each of the reported AEs were assessed. Vital signs, blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) and heart rate were regularly measured during the study. Laboratory investigations including haematology, biochemistry and urinalysis were performed during the screening period, Day −2 and follow‐up. Any clinically relevant abnormalities were reported as AEs. Results Subject characteristics and disposition Subject disposition and characteristics are summarized in Table  1  and in Figure  1 . Of the 40 subjects enrolled, 23 subjects were Caucasian (12 females and 11 males) and 17 were Japanese (5 females and 12 males). Thirty‐eight subjects completed the study, two subjects being withdrawn. One subject received 5 and 40 mg amisulpride before withdrawal due to non‐compliance with the protocol and one received moxifloxacin before choosing to withdraw. All subjects were included in all the analysis sets, with the exception of the subject withdrawn due to protocol non‐compliance, who was included in the safety set but not in the PK set.

At the end of the infusion of amisulpride 5 mg, ΔQTcF was slightly changed, with a difference relative to baseline of 0.9 ms (90% CI: 1.1, 3.0 ms) at 2 min. At 8 min ΔQTcF increased by 2.4 ms (90% CI: 0.6, 4.2 ms). Following administration of a 40 mg dose, ΔQTcF increased 5.2 ms (90% CI: 3.2, 7.3 ms) at 2 min and had a peak value of 20.8 ms (90% CI: 19, 22.6 ms) at 8 min, the end of infusion for the higher dose. The upper bound of the confidence interval remained above 10 ms at 30 min and 1 h (16.9 and 10.5 ms, respectively). The ΔQTcF profile of amisulpride 40 mg returned to levels similar to baseline after 2 h. Following administration of placebo, ΔQTcF showed a maximum shortening at 4 h, with a difference relative to baseline of −4.9 ms (90% CI: −6.7, −3.2), returning to baseline level at 6 h.

Based on a linear mixed effects model with treatment, sex and race as factors and average as covariate Following i.v. administration of amisulpride 5 mg, the ΔΔQTcF profile demonstrated no changes of concern. At the end of infusion (2 min), mean ΔΔQTcF was 3.6 ms (90% CI: 1.5, 5.8 ms), and the maximal mean ΔΔQTcF was 5.0 ms (90% CI: 2.8, 7.1 ms), occurring at 8 min. The increase was transient and at 30 min the mean difference was 2.1 ms (90% CI: 0.1, 4.2 ms). A 40 mg infusion over 8 min resulted in a mean ΔΔQTcF of 7.9 ms (90% CI: 5.8, 10.0 ms) at 2 min and 23.4 ms (90% CI: 21.3, 25.5) at the end of the infusion (Table  2 ). The ΔΔQTcF returned to below 5 ms by 2 h and was at baseline levels by 6 h (Figure  2 B). After an oral dose of 400 mg moxifloxacin, ΔΔQTcF was unchanged until 2 h post‐dose, then increased above 5 ms between 3 h and 24 h post‐dose, peaking at 4 h (12.3 ms; 90% CI: 10.1, 14.6 ms) (Figure  2 B). The Hochberg procedure applied to the results of the 2, 3 and 4 h time points showed a statistically significant difference between placebo and moxifloxacin ( p  &lt; 0.001), confirming study sensitivity. The moxifloxacin profile was consistent with previous studies where moxifloxacin was administered in the fed and fasted states, whereby the peak of the QTc effect is delayed if oral moxifloxacin is administered after a meal  23 ,  24 . In terms of heart rate on the ECG recordings, the largest change from baseline for all treatments occurred at 24 h: 4.4 bpm for APD421 5 mg, 3.8 bpm for APD421 40 mg, 4.3 bpm for placebo and 4.6 bpm for moxifloxacin. At the 8 min time point (end of infusion), heart rate was 64.6 bpm after APD421 40 mg and 60.4 bpm after placebo. Change from baseline for these two treatments at this time point was 3.1 bpm and −2.1 bpm, respectively, which is a difference of about 5 bpm. Categorical analysis There were no absolute QTcF values &gt;500 ms or QTcF values &gt;480 ms at any point during the study and no subjects had a QTcF value &gt;450 ms after administration of 5 mg amisulpride. QTcF values &gt;450 ms occurred with placebo ( n  = 2), before administration of amisulpride ( n  = 1) and after 40 mg amisulpride administration, at the 8 min ( n  = 4) and 30 min ( n  = 2) time points. Moxifloxacin QTcF values greater than 450 ms were recorded in six occasions at 4 h ( n  = 1), 6 h ( n  = 2), 12 h ( n  = 2) and 24 h ( n  = 1) after administration. QTcF increases from baseline greater than 30 ms occurred at 8 min ( n  = 4), 30 min ( n  = 1) and 90 min ( n  = 1) after the start of infusion of 40 mg amisulpride.

 max  (169 ng ml −1  for 5 mg amisulpride and 1276 ng ml −1  for 40 mg), the predicted increase in QTcF was 5.1 ms for the 5 mg dose and 24.4 ms for 40 mg, using a linear concentration effect model. The PK‐PD relationship was linear and dose proportional with no differences between the ethnic groups, with neither the difference between slopes ( p ‐value = 0.540) nor that between intercepts for Caucasian and Japanese being statistically significant (Figure  3 B). Predictions at 5 mg amisulpride also showed no ethnic differences ( p ‐value = 0.434). The marginally significant difference in the prediction at the higher dose of amisulpide can be explained by the differences in pharmacokinetics as the differences in slopes to only contribute minimally. Regression analysis of PK‐PD predicted that each additional increase of 10 ng ml −1  in plasma amisulpride concentration would lead to an increase in QTcF of 0.175 ms. Mean PK (concentration) and PD (placebo‐corrected change from time‐matched baseline) time courses for the two doses of amisulpride suggested no evidence of hysteresis. Safety and tolerability A total of 74 adverse events (AEs) were reported in 34 of 40 subjects, 8 with moxifloxacin, 11 in the placebo arm, 12 with 5 mg amisulpride and 43 with 40 mg amisulpride. There were no serious adverse events (SAEs), no AEs which led to withdrawal and no AEs with severe intensity. The most frequently reported treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were infusion‐related reactions reported four times in the placebo group by two Caucasian and two Japanese subjects, three times in the 5 mg amisulpride group by one Caucasian subject and two Japanese, and 31 times in the 40 mg amisulpride group by 16 Caucasians and 15 Japanese. The infusion‐related reactions were a result of the higher infusion rate. In general, infusion‐related reactions with amisulpride were essentially associated with site pain and began as soon as the infusions started and lasted the duration of the infusion, resolving within a few minutes after the end of infusion. In previous clinical studies with i.v. amisulpride, infusion site reactions were also shown to be short‐lived and resolved when the infusion was slowed down or stopped. Infusion‐related reactions were not specific to any ethnic group. Most AEs were of Grade 1 on the CTCAE scale and of mild intensity, with the exception of two events of Grade 2 (diarrhoea in one female Japanese subject and anxiety in one male Caucasian subject) that were reported after 5 mg amisulpride. These were isolated events and both resolved without corrective therapy. There were no clinically relevant changes in the laboratory parameters or physical examinations in this study. Discussion This was the first study to evaluate the effects of therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses of an i.v. formulation of amisulpride on cardiac repolarization in line with a specifically designed TQT study performed according to ICH E14  25 . The effect of moxifloxacin on QTcF confirmed the sensitivity of the study to detect a relevant increase in QTcF. In respect of a single i.v. dose of amisulpride at 5 mg, the study met the criteria for a negative TQT study, with the upper bound of 90% two‐sided confidence falling well below 10 ms. The effect of the 5 mg dose on the QT duration was small and very short‐lived, with values returning to pre‐dose levels within 30 min of administration. A more rapidly infused eight‐fold supratherapeutic dose of amisulpride did cause a meaningful prolongation of the QT interval. None of the subjects had QTcF values &gt;500 ms or &gt;480 ms at either dose; increases from baseline in QTc of &gt;30 ms occurred only with 40 mg amisulpride. Both doses were well tolerated by Caucasian and Japanese subjects. The statistical analysis of this study suggested that ethnicity has no influence on QT response to amisulpride. Although the slopes of amisulpride effect were not statistically significant, the difference in the predicted effect at 40 mg amisulpride was marginally significant. One limitation of this study is the fact that 12 of the 17 Japanese subjects were male. The most frequently reported AE was pain in the arm during infusion which is dependent on the rate of infusion and can be mostly avoided by reducing the infusion speed. The capability for hERG blockade has been shown as the primary mechanism to predict QT prolongation associated with antipsychotic drugs  26 . Amisulpride, in common with some other substituted benzamides, was found to inhibit hERG current with an IC 50  of around 100 μM  15 , a markedly lower potency than some D 2  antagonists. For example, droperidol, a butyrophenone used both as an antipsychotic and an antiemetic, has an IC 50  two to three orders of greater, at 32.2 nM  27 . Statistical models designed to predict the extent of QTc as a function of the blocking effects on hERG and Na V 1.5 may explain the QTc variability between antipsychotic drugs, suggesting that inhibition of late I Na  can act as a counterbalance of the effect of inhibition of I Kr  which can have an effect on the drug's pro‐arrhythmic potential triggered by hERG blockade  16 . However, the effect of amisulpride on sodium channels remains to be fully elucidated. Literature on oral amisulpride used to treat psychiatric disorders since its first marketing authorization in 1986 supports amisulpride's low propensity for clinical cardiac toxicity in practice. A review of 11 studies involving 1933 patients, of whom 905 had received amisulpride for acute exacerbations of schizophrenia at a mean daily dose of 670 mg (range 100–1200) and 342 had received amisulpride for predominant negative schizophrenia at a mean daily dose of 118 mg, confirmed the satisfactory cardiovascular safety profile of amisulpride. Overall, blood pressure variations were devoid of clinical significance and no arrhythmia was reported  6 . The occurrence of torsade de pointes associated with amisulpride has been reported  9 ,  10 ,  11 ,  12 ,  13 . However, all cases are related to extremely large acute overdoses of amisulpride, ranging from 4000–80 000 mg, leading to high plasma concentration of amisulpride. The plasma concentrations observed in these cases are two to three orders of magnitude above the mean  C 
 max  plasma levels reported at the highest dose in this study, indicating that the supratherapeutic dose to treat PONV is not associated with torsade de pointes. The predicted  C 
 max  concentrations from the concentration–response analysis model fit were in close agreement with the observed data in this study. The observed  C 
 max  values were 200 ng ml −1  and 1305 ng ml −1  for the 5 and 40 mg amisulpride doses, respectively. These findings are in agreement with observed amisulpride plasma concentration levels in schizophrenic patients ranging from 20–1904 ng ml −1  after oral administration of 150–1600 mg day −1  of amisulpride  28 . Additionally, plasma levels of 424 ng ml −1  (SD 292.8 ng ml −1 ) were reported as therapeutic for schizophrenia after an average daily dose of 772.3 mg (SD 346.7 mg) amisulpride  28 . The largest available oral presentation of amisulpride, a 400 mg tablet, was reported to deliver a  C 
 max  of approximately 1300 ng ml −1 
 29 . This is more than five times higher than the  C 
 max  of the 5 mg i.v. infusion and analogous to the  C 
 max  of the 40 mg i.v. infusion. Regarding the use of amisulpride as an anti‐emetic, a bell‐shaped dose–response showed that a 5 mg dose is more effective than lower and higher doses  20 . The  C 
 max  of 200 ng ml −1  obtained after administration of 5 mg amisulpride at 2.5 mg min −1  in this study can be associated with clinical effectiveness in the treatment and prevention of PONV. Interestingly, therapeutic drug monitoring has demonstrated that the plasma concentration of approximately 200 ng ml −1  is associated with optimal clinical response when oral doses of 400–800 mg day −1  of amisulpride are administered in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder cases  30 ,  31 . The linear and proportional PK‐PD relationship observed indicated that the attained  C 
 max  in this study is dependent on dose and rate of infusion. However, this study investigated only two dose regimens and two infusion rates, limiting conclusions on the effects on QTcF of higher doses of amisulpride administered at lower infusion rates; and, in particular, the infusion rate which may be needed to avoid a significant QT/QTc interval prolongation with higher doses of amisulpride. In summary, this study shows that the proposed therapeutic dose of 5 mg amisulpride for the management of PONV, given intravenously over 2 min, is well tolerated by healthy Caucasian and Japanese subjects and is not associated with a QTcF prolongation of regulatory concern.

    <Body>What is already known about this subject 
 Fremanezumab plasma concentration–time profiles and exposure parameters were similar in Japanese and Caucasian healthy subjects following single dose subcutaneous administration of 225, 675 and 900 mg. The long half‐life of fremanezumab (30 days) supports monthly or quarterly administration. 
 What this study adds 
 The population pharmacokinetics of fremanezumab after intravenous and subcutaneous administration was characterized in over 2500 subjects (including patients with chronic migraine or episodic migraine) using a 2‐compartment model with first‐order absorption and elimination. Weight was the only significant covariate predictive of variability in fremanezumab pharmacokinetics; higher weight was associated with lower exposure. 
 1 INTRODUCTION Calcitonin gene‐related protein (CGRP) is a well‐studied neuropeptide and vasodilator that plays an important role in the pathogenesis of migraine, both centrally and peripherally. 1 ,  2  Increased CGRP levels have been detected in the external jugular vein during an acute migraine attack, 3  consistent with previous reports that intravenous (IV) CGRP administration induces migraine‐like headaches in most individuals with migraine, but not healthy control subjects. 4  Small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists have demonstrated efficacy in acute migraine 5 ,  6 ,  7  and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target CGRP or its receptor have demonstrated efficacy as preventive treatment in episodic migraine (EM) and chronic migraine (CM) studies. 8 ,  9 
 Fremanezumab, a fully humanized IgG 2 Δa/κ mAb, selectively targets CGRP and has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults. 8  Fremanezumab binds to the CGRP ligand and blocks both the α‐ and β‐CGRP isoforms from binding to the CGRP receptor. 8  Introduction of 2 mutations into the constant region of the fremanezumab heavy chain limits antibody effector functions, thereby preventing fremanezumab from stimulating antibody‐dependent cell‐mediated cytotoxicity and triggering complement‐mediated lysis. 10 
 During the development of fremanezumab, pharmacometric modelling and simulation were used extensively to support development‐related decision‐making and are described in this manuscript. A population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) model was iteratively developed using a 3‐staged approach. Initially, it was developed using intensive data from healthy subjects in 2 phase 1 studies following IV and subcutaneous (SC) administration, 11  then adding informative data from the long‐term safety (LTS) phase 3 study in EM and CM migraine patients after SC administration. 12  Finally, it was further refined by adding trough samples collected after SC administration from 2 phase 2b 13 ,  14 ,  15  and 3 phase 3 trials (2 pivotal studies and the LTS study. 12 ,  16 ,  17  The final PopPK model provided a basis for prediction of subject‐specific exposure estimates to support future assessment of exposure–response relationships for efficacy and safety endpoints. This manuscript represents the first published PopPK analysis for a therapeutic mAb targeting the CGRP pathway. 2 METHODS 2.1 Data Data from 7 clinical studies evaluating IV and SC administration of fremanezumab in healthy subjects and patients with EM or CM were pooled for analysis (Table  1 ). The 2 phase 1 studies included full‐profile blood sampling for determination of fremanezumab concentrations over 90 or 225 days, whereas a sparse sampling strategy (monthly predose trough samples) was implemented in the phase 2b and 3 studies (2 pivotal studies and 1 LTS study). Two additional nontrough samples were obtained from patients enrolled in the phase 3 LTS study who did not roll over from 1 of the 2 double‐blind phase 3 trials. Fremanezumab was administered subcutaneously, except for 1 phase 1 study that included both IV and SC administration.

All studies were conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Clinical protocols were reviewed and approved for each site by institutional review boards and all study participants provided written informed consent prior to enrolment in the studies. 2.2 Bioanalysis A sandwich enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay procedure was used for measurement of plasma fremanezumab concentrations. The method was validated in the concentration range of 250 to 3500 ng/mL as assessed via accuracy and precision using fremanezumab spiked at different levels in the human plasma samples. The accuracy of the spiked samples varied between 98 and 104% of the nominal concentrations. The interassay precision varied from 3 to 7% and the intra‐assay from 3 to 5%. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) value for the PK assay used in the analysis was 250 ng/mL. 2.3 Population PK modelling NONMEM, v7.3, was used for all model development (first‐order conditional estimation with interaction method), simulations and evaluation procedures, 18  and KIWI, v3 (or later), was used for model discrimination and data visualization. 19 
 Figure  1  illustrates the PopPK model development process for fremanezumab. Exploratory graphical analysis of the concentration–time data obtained following IV administration of fremanezumab in the phase 1 bioavailability study exhibited a biphasic profile, suggesting a 2‐compartmental model; however, models based on data following SC administration indicated a 1‐compartmental model. Hence, the modelling was initiated using only the IV data fitted to a 2‐compartment model. Then, a systematic, stepwise approach to model building was implemented given the heterogeneous nature of the pooled dataset after SC administration. Data collected after SC administration were added to the analysis dataset in stages from most to least informative: (i) intensive SC data from the study including both IV and SC administration (used to estimate bioavailability); (ii) data from the other phase 1 study with SC administration to establish a model based on all intensive phase 1 data; (iii) data from the phase 3 study with additional nontrough sampling; and (iv) trough samples from the phase 2b and 3 studies. Figure 1 Flowchart of the fremanezumab population pharmacokinetic model development process Between‐subject variability (BSV) in parameters was modelled using an exponential form. Residual variability (RV) was modelled using a proportional or additive plus proportional form, as appropriate. 20 
 2.3.1 Covariate analysis The influence of various intrinsic and extrinsic factors on the PK of fremanezumab was evaluated, including weight, age, race, sex, patient status, albumin, anti‐drug antibody (ADA) status, injection site, renal function category, hepatic function category, and use of preventive, acute or analgesic medications. Continuous covariates were centred about the population median value to improve the precision of the parameter estimates. 20 
 Forward selection followed by backward elimination (α = 0.01 with decrease in BSV by ≥5% and α = 0.001, respectively; 1 df for χ 2 ‐distribution) methods were used to assess covariate relationships. After backward elimination, the reduced multivariable model was then evaluated for any remaining biases in the BSV and RV error models and refined, as necessary. 2.3.2 Model evaluation The adequacy of the final model was evaluated using a simulation‐based, prediction‐corrected visual predictive check (VPC) method. 21 ,  22  Simulations were performed ( n  = 1000 replicates) using the final model and statistics of interest were calculated for comparison with observed data; e.g., the 5th, 50th (median) and 95th percentiles of the simulated and observed concentration distributions. These percentiles were plotted  vs  time, with the original observed dataset and percentiles based on the observed data overlaid to visually assess concordance between the model‐based simulated data and the observed data. 2.4 Simulations Model‐based simulations were performed to evaluate exposures for the 2474 patients enrolled in the phase 2b or 3 trials, based on SC dosing regimens of fremanezumab administered in the phase 3 clinical trials: 225 mg SC monthly for 12 doses (with and without a starting dose of 675 mg) and 675 mg SC quarterly for 4 doses. Patient‐level measures of steady‐state fremanezumab exposure, including maximum drug concentration (C max,ss ), average drug concentration (C av,ss ), and area under the fremanezumab drug concentration  vs  time curve (AUC ss ), were calculated based on the individual Bayesian estimates of model parameters from day 0 to day 28 or day 84 (for monthly or quarterly dosing regimens, respectively). 3 RESULTS 3.1 Exploratory data analysis A total of 13 745 fremanezumab concentrations (2436 samples from phase 1 and 2b trials and 11 309 samples from phase 3 trials) collected from 2546 individuals (74 healthy subjects and 2474 patients) were used for the PopPK modelling. Concentrations below the LLOQ comprised 1.9% of all postdose samples and were excluded from the analysis dataset used for modelling. The analysis population for the pooled data was primarily Caucasian (79.9%) and female (86.1%) with a median (range) age of 43 (18–71) years and median (range) body weight of 70.8 (43.5–131.8) kg. Approximately 20% of the PK samples were collected in the presence of preventive medications, 55% in the presence of acute medications and 9% in the presence of analgesics. The presence of ADAs was confirmed in only 0.7% of the samples collected. Supporting Table  S1  provides a summary of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors by study phase. Figure  2  displays a semilogarithmic scatterplot of dose‐normalized plasma fremanezumab concentrations  vs  time since the previous dose for the pooled phase 1/2b/3 data. The dose‐normalized concentration data generally show similar exposures between the phase 1, 2b and 3 data, with relatively greater variability evident in the sparse phase 2b/3 data.

Conc, concentration; norm, normalized 3.2 Final fremanezumab population PK model A 2‐compartment model with first‐order absorption and a lag time, first‐order elimination, an effect of weight on CL and central volume of distribution (V c ), a proportional RV model for the IV data and a combined additive and proportional RV model for the SC data (Figure  3 ) adequately fit the pooled phase 1/2b/3 data. The model included separate estimates of central volume for IV (V c , IV ) and SC (V c , SC ) administration. Parameters for the peripheral compartment (intercompartmental clearance [Q] and peripheral volume of distribution [V p ]) were estimated from the IV phase 1 data and fixed in subsequent stages. In addition, absolute bioavailability (F) and lag time were estimated based on both IV and SC phase 1 data and subsequently fixed for models including the entire pooled phase 1/2b/3 dataset. Table  2  provides the final parameter estimates and corresponding precisions for the final PopPK model of fremanezumab. The typical values (for a 71‐kg subject, the median weight in this population) for central CL and V c,SC  were 0.0902 L/d and 1.88 L, respectively, with an estimated F of 0.658 for SC administration. Based on the allometric relationships with weight, relative to a 71‐kg subject (the median weight in the population), a 51‐kg subject and a 101‐kg subject (i.e. 5th and 95th percentiles of body weight in the analysis dataset) are expected to have approximately 29% lower and 45% higher CL and 40% lower and 71% higher V c , respectively.

 f Phase 1 data (subcutaneous [SC]) and the patients with additional pharmacokinetic samples in Study TV48125‐CNS‐30051 were considered to have appropriate and informative data to contribute to the estimation of between‐subject variability (BSV) in the central volume of distribution (V c ) and absorption rate constant (k a ). Thus, data from other patients were excluded from the estimation of BSV and calculation of shrinkage in the BSV of V c  and k a . g Epsilon shrinkage ranged from 3.1 to 9.0%. All parameters were estimated well, with no high correlations (|r| &gt; 0.9) between parameter estimates. The magnitude of estimated BSV was lower for CL (23.4%) and V c  (35.1%), compared to first‐order absorption rate constant (k a ; 59.0%). To improve model stability, subjects with IV infusion administration or trough‐only sampling were not included in the estimation of BSV on k a  or V c ; this was accomplished by fixing the individual values of k a  or V c  for these subjects equal to the typical value. Estimated RV ranged from 93.3%CV at low individual predicted concentrations (values near the LLOQ) to 23.1% for fremanezumab predicted concentrations &gt;10 μg/mL. Goodness‐of‐fit plots for the final PopPK model (Figure  4 ) indicate that the model provided a reasonable fit to the data following both IV and SC administration. Scatterplots of individual estimates of random effect terms of 1 parameter  vs  another, assessing the assumption of zero covariance, showed no apparent trends (data not shown). As such, no off‐diagonal omega matrix elements were estimated. Figure 4 Goodness‐of‐fit diagnostic plots for the fremanezumab final population pharmacokinetic model, including observed concentrations  vs  population predicted and individual predicted values; residuals and conditional weighted residuals  vs  population predicted values; conditional weighted residuals  vs  time; normalized prediction distribution errors (NPDE) values  vs  time since dosing; and individual weighted residuals  vs  individual predicted values. The red line is a reference line or the line of identity, the blue line is a smoothing spline. Conc, concentration The effect of intrinsic and extrinsic factors (including dose) on specified PK parameters was evaluated. The inclusion of weight as a covariate was statistically significant and reduced the BSV in CL and V c  by 22 and 16%, respectively. No other covariate effects were found to be statistically significant predictors of fremanezumab PopPK. Since data regarding injection site were not available from all subjects in the full dataset, the covariate effect of injection site on fremanezumab absorption was explored in a subpopulation analysis wherein only data deemed potentially informative to this covariate of interest were included. Patients from the LTS phase 3 study who had additional samples collected during days 3–10 or 15–20 were included in the analysis. Subjects were considered evaluable only if at each visit all injections for a given dose were within the same anatomic location (abdomen, thigh or upper arm), and the subsequent corresponding PK sample(s) was collected at an informative time (with respect to k a ). Injection site was evaluated as a time‐varying covariate on k a , and all parameters (except k a ) were fixed to the final model parameter estimates. Based on the prespecified criteria for covariate analysis (i.e.  P  &lt; .01 and reduction in BSV in the parameter of interest of at least 5%), injection site was not considered a significant covariate on k a  in this subpopulation analysis. 3.3 Evaluation of the model Prediction‐corrected VPC was performed using the final PopPK model to ensure adequate model performance and assess the predictive capabilities of the model. The median and 90% prediction interval, derived from the simulated datasets, overlaid on the observed fremanezumab concentration data and corresponding percentiles for the intensive phase 1 IV and SC data and the sparse phase 2b/3 SC data are provided in Figure  5  and Figure  6 , respectively. For the phase 1 data, a small degree of overprediction is apparent around the peak with some underprediction during the post‐absorptive phase of the profile. At almost all sampling time points for the phase 2b/3 data, the percentiles based on the observed data fall within the confidence interval around the corresponding simulation‐based percentile, indicating excellent predictive performance of the model for the data following SC administration in migraine patients.

Figure 7 Simulated fremanezumab concentration–time profiles for the subcutaneous dose regimens used in the phase 3 clinical trials administered over 12 months. Conc, concentration Boxplots of exposure measures  vs  select patient covariates were examined to determine if these covariates exhibited a clinically relevant impact on fremanezumab steady‐state exposure. Figure  8  provides representative boxplots of exposures (particularly, C av,ss(0–28d)  and C av,ss(0–84d) )  vs  quartiles of body weight following administration of 225 mg SC once monthly and 675 mg SC once quarterly. Across the range of body weight (the only covariate found to be significant in the model), a decrease in fremanezumab exposure was evident across the quartiles of increasing body weight. The findings were consistent across additional exposure measures, including C max,ss(0–28d) , C max,ss(0–84d) , AUC ss(0–28d) , and AUC ss(0–84d) . Figure 8 Boxplots of model‐predicted C av,ss(0–28d)  and C av,ss(0–84d)  by quartiles of body weight in patients: 225 mg subcutaneous once monthly for 12 doses (left) and 675 mg subcutaneous once quarterly for 4 doses (right). C av,ss(0–28d) , average fremanezumab plasma concentration from 0 to 28 days at steady state; C av,ss(0–84d) , average fremanezumab plasma concentration from 0 to 84 days at steady state Supporting Figure  S1  and Figure  S2  provide boxplots of fremanezumab C av,ss  following administration of 225 mg SC once monthly  vs  intrinsic and extrinsic factors evaluated as potential predictors of variability in PK. Figure  S1  presents fremanezumab exposure  vs  sex, acute medication usage (ergotamine/triptan), and renal function category. For these factors, trends are evident for marginally higher exposures in females, patients receiving acute medications and patients with impaired renal function (as compared to males, patients not receiving acute medications and patients with normal renal function, respectively). However, despite these trends, none of these factors were found to be statistically significant covariates in the PopPK analysis, and overlap in the range of exposures is observed across groups. Similar results were observed for 675 mg quarterly doses (data not shown). Supporting Figure  S2  presents boxplots of fremanezumab C av,ss  following administration of 225 mg SC once monthly  vs  age quartile, race, liver function category, analgesic medication usage, preventive medication usage, ADA status and patient status. The results demonstrate that exposures are consistent across the sub‐groups representing each of these factors and are consistent with the PopPK analysis findings as there was no statistically significant effect of these factors on fremanezumab PK. Similar results were observed for 675 mg quarterly doses (data not shown). The calculated model‐based median terminal half‐life was approximately 30 days (independent of dose or dose regimen). Based on predicted exposure levels in the phase 3 studies, fremanezumab concentrations approach steady state by 3 months of treatment and steady state is expected to be achieved by approximately 168 days (6 months) for the 225 mg monthly and 675 mg quarterly regimens (Figure  7 ). As shown in Table  3 , comparison of the exposures following the final (12th) dose of the 225 mg monthly regimen to exposures following a single dose resulted in a median accumulation ratio of 2.43 and 2.38 for the area under the fremanezumab plasma concentration  vs  time curve from 0 to 28 days (AUC 0–28d ) and C max , respectively; for the 675 mg once‐quarterly dosing regimen, the exposures after dose 4 (final dose) compared to dose 1 resulted in a median accumulation ratio of 1.21 and 1.22 for area under the fremanezumab plasma concentration  vs  time curve from 0 to 84 days (AUC 0–84d ) and C max , respectively.

A 2‐compartment model with first‐order absorption and elimination and allometric weight scaling of CL and V c  (with estimated exponents) reasonably fit the phase 1/2b/3 data. Despite the large pooled phase 1/2b/3 dataset, this modelling effort was somewhat limited by the designs of the studies included. Within the phase 1 healthy subject studies, no multiple‐dosing data were available, limiting knowledge of accumulation to steady‐state conditions and within‐subject variability in the healthy subject population. Furthermore, the phase 2b and pivotal 3 trials, which comprised the majority of the dataset, included exclusively sparse PK data collection, consisting entirely of trough, predose samples. However, additional information was obtained regarding absorption, peak concentration and the first elimination phase from 2 additional samples collected from a subset of patients in the LTS study at specified times following dosing. The final model structure illustrates how the iterative approach maximized the use of informative data during model development to address the apparent discrepancy in compartmental structure for IV  vs  SC dosing. Exploratory plots demonstrated that the concentration–time profile following SC administration reflects a monophasic decrease after absorption, while the profile following IV administration reflects a biphasic process. In fact, when data following IV administration were not included in the dataset, the 2‐compartment model fit could not be supported. 23  By fixing the parameters defining the peripheral compartment, both the IV and SC data were fit adequately and a precise estimate of bioavailability was obtained. Given that the apparent differences in fremanezumab elimination between IV and SC administration are probably due to the fact that the relatively slow absorption phase following SC administration masks the initial elimination phase observed following IV administration, rather than patient‐related differences, if IV data were available from patients with migraine (EM or CM), it would be expected that the estimates of Q and V p  would be similar to those observed in healthy volunteers. Furthermore, the effect of patient status, defined as healthy subjects  vs  patients with migraine, was evaluated as a covariate and found not to be a statistically significant predictor of variability in fremanezumab PK (see also Supporting Figure  S2  illustrating the similarity in exposure between healthy subjects and patients). In general, fixed and random effect parameters were estimated with good precision, and goodness‐of‐fit plots, as well as VPC diagnostics, indicated a good fit of the model to the data. The model characterized the overall PK data well and accurately captured the central tendency and shape of the multiple‐dose profile. After adjusting PK parameters for inclusion of IV data in the model (using the estimated F of 0.658), apparent clearance (CL/F) and total apparent volume (V c /F + V p /F) for a typical subject (weighing 71 kg) were 0.137 L/d and 5.47 L, respectively. These values are similar to those reported previously 11  (mean CL/F values from 0.111 to 0.129 L/d and mean apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase from 5.711 to 6.430 L) and are generally consistent with previously reported values for IgG antibodies. 24 ,  25  Dose proportionality assessment was performed and suggested no changes in PK parameters with respect to dose. As generally observed with mAbs, weight was a significant predictor of variability in PK for both CL and V c ; higher weight was associated with increased CL and V c . The effects of other covariates evaluated (race, sex, albumin, age, renal function category, injection site, and acute, analgesic and preventive medications) were not found to statistically significantly influence the PK of fremanezumab. The lack of race as a significant covariate is consistent with a previous noncompartmental PK analysis comparing the single‐dose PK of fremanezumab in Japanese and matched Caucasian healthy subjects. 11  Geometric mean ratios (i.e. Japanese/Caucasian ratios) for AUC and C max  were within the default 0.80–1.25 no‐effect range across all doses, with similar median time of C max  (range of 5–11 days) and mean half‐lives (range of 31–39 days) for both ethnicities. ADA status and liver function were evaluated on an exploratory basis due to limited sample size within the respective categories and the results showed no indication of these covariates having an impact on fremanezumab exposure. Exploratory graphical evaluation and additional covariate analysis on a subset of the population was performed to evaluate the effect of injection site on k a  and found no significant effect of injection site on variability in the rate of absorption. Due to the limited data available in the studies deemed to be informative to the estimation of F, the effect of injection site on F could not be formally evaluated. Although it is reported that injection site can have an impact on both the rate and the extent of absorption for mAbs, the effect of injection site on the extent of absorption is considered less likely. 26 ,  27  Furthermore, since the lymphatic pathway may represent the primary mechanism for absorption of IgG‐type mAbs, it is possible that the inherent slow absorption makes the regional variation of lymph flow associated with different injection sites negligible in terms of an effect on F such that the extent of absorption does not differ significantly between dosing sites. 28 
 Based on the model, fremanezumab exhibits linear, dose‐proportional kinetics with a calculated median terminal half‐life of approximately 30 days with fremanezumab concentrations approaching steady state by 3 months of treatment and steady‐state conditions are expected to be achieved by approximately 168 days (6 months) for the 225 mg SC monthly and 675 mg SC quarterly dosing regimens. This estimated half‐life is consistent with the typical range of half‐life values reported for other therapeutic mAbs. 29 ,  30  In particular, for the mAbs that target the CGRP pathway, the reported half‐life is 28 days for erenumab and 27 days for galcanezumab. 31 ,  32  Approximately 2‐fold accumulation based on AUC 0–28  and C max  is anticipated for the 225 mg SC once‐monthly dosing regimen, whereas, minimal accumulation is anticipated for the 675 mg SC once‐quarterly fremanezumab dosing regimen. In conclusion, the PopPK model for fremanezumab well described the PK data observed in a large population of healthy subjects and patients with CM or EM following IV and SC administration of a wide range of doses and dosing intervals. As expected, this analysis confirmed the influence of weight on the PK parameters of fremanezumab, whereby higher body weight is associated with lower exposure. The prolonged absorption and long elimination half‐lives for fremanezumab supports the use of monthly or quarterly dosing regimens and the lack of significant influence of other intrinsic or extrinsic factors on fremanezumab exposure suggests no need for dose modification in special populations. Furthermore, the predictive performance of the model indicates its appropriateness in predicting subject‐specific estimates of exposure for use in the evaluation of relationships between exposure and safety and efficacy response.

    <Body>What is Already Known about this Subject 
 There have been several reports about ethnic differences in pharmacokinetics (PK) among  Asian  populations, although their genetic background is rather similar. Such ethnic differences in drug responses need to be considered in global clinical trials, requiring independent trials in various countries. 
 What this Study Adds 
 This was the first PK study conducted simultaneously at multinational sites in East  Asia  under a strict protocol. For three drugs with previously reported differences, there were no major differences in PK parameters among East  Asian  groups (and Caucasians). These results provide the basis for interpreting pharmacokinetic data from East  Asian  countries. 
 Introduction In the drug development process, efficient performance of clinical trials is a critical factor for reducing both time and cost. Global clinical trials represent one approach to improving efficiency, but sometimes ethnic differences in drug responses need to be considered and such differences may require independent clinical trials in various countries  1 ,  2 . This issue is also a major problem for regulatory agencies. From an ethical viewpoint, it is problematic that repeating clinical trials in different countries leads to an increase in the number of participants required. Ethnic differences in drug responses are caused not only by intrinsic factors such as genetic differences (genetic polymorphism of metabolic enzymes or transporters) or differences in body weight  3 , but also by extrinsic factors such as environmental differences (diet, habits, climate, etc.)  3 ,  4 ,  5 . There is considerable evidence of genetic similarity among different East  Asian  populations  6 ,  7 ,  8 . For example, the frequencies of genetic variants of several drug metabolizing enzymes (CYP2C9  8 ,  9 ,  10 , CYP2C19  6 ,  8 ,  10 ,  11 , CYP2D6  6 ,  8 ,  12  and CYP3A4  6 ,  8 ), drug transporters (P‐glycoprotein  13  and SLCO1B1  6 ), and hormone receptors (adrenergic receptors  14 ) are similar among East  Asian  populations, whereas these frequencies show larger differences between East Asians and Caucasians  6 ,  15 ,  16 ,  17 . Because extrinsic factors, such as diet and beverages, also influence drug responses, such factors may lead to pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic differences even among East  Asian  countries  1 ,  5 ,  8 ,  18 . It has been reported that some drugs show ethnic differences in PK parameters among East  Asian  populations  19 ,  20 ,  21 ,  22 ,  23 , although the mechanisms underlying these differences have not been clarified. The aim of the present study was to examine whether strict control of clinical trial conditions such as intake of food and beverages could reduce differences in the PK parameters of drugs that were previously reported to show marked differences among various ethnic groups, including East Asians ( Chinese , Koreans and  Japanese ) and Caucasians. For this purpose, we surveyed East  Asian  and Caucasian PK data on more than 40 drugs and found 17 drugs with differences among East  Asian  populations or differences between East Asians and Caucasians. Among these drugs, we chose moxifloxacin, simvastatin, and meloxicam, as large ethnic differences in their PK parameters have been reported and the reasons for such differences have not been clarified. To investigate relevant intrinsic factors, polymorphism of genes for major metabolic enzymes or transporters was also examined, including polymorphism of  UGT1A1  for moxifloxacin,  SLCO1B1  for simvastatin and  CYP2C9  for meloxicam. Methods Subjects and study sites Healthy male  Japanese ,  Chinese ,  Korean  and Caucasian subjects (aged 20 to 35 years, body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to &lt;30.0 and body weight of 50.0 to 100.0 kg at screening) were enrolled in open‐label, single‐dose PK studies of moxifloxacin, simvastatin and meloxicam. All subjects were healthy on the basis of their medical histories. They did not have a present or past history of organopathy, such as heart disease (including QTc prolongation) or lung, liver or kidney disease; hypersensitivity or allergies to drugs or foods, etc.; or drug or alcohol abuse (ethanol intake ≤50 g/day). They were normal based on prestudy physical examination, electrocardiography, and clinical laboratory tests. The study sites were Kitasato University ( Tokyo ,  Japan ),  Seoul  National University ( Seoul ,  Korea ), Peking University First Hospital (Beijing,  China ), and SNBL Clinical Research Center (Baltimore,  USA ). Ethnicity of the subjects was defined as follows. Subjects who were citizens living in  Japan ,  China  or  Korea  were defined as  Japanese ,  Chinese  or  Korean , respectively. Their parents and grandparents had also been citizens living in the same countries. The male Caucasian subjects were recruited in the  USA , and their ancestors were from Northern Europe according to their own declaration. The number of subjects enrolled in each study was calculated from the variance of previously published data as the number required to confirm or exclude the hypothesis that ethnic differences in PK existed among these populations, amounting to a maximum of 20% for moxifloxacin or meloxicam and 40% for simvastatin. All of the subjects gave written informed consent prior to commencement of the studies. The ethics committees or Institutional Review Boards of Kitasato University,  Seoul  National University, Peking University First Hospital, SNBL Clinical Research Center and related institutes approved the conduct of these PK studies. Approval numbers or dates for Kitasato University,  Seoul  National University, Peking University First Hospital and SNBL Clinical Research Center were respectively as follows: 09612, H‐1001‐022‐306, 2010–03 and 1/26/2010 for the moxifloxacin study; 10616, H‐1006‐109‐322, 2010–13 and 6/29/2010 for the simvastatin study; 10618, H‐1010‐009‐334, 2010–20 and 11/9/2010 for the meloxicam study. All of the studies were registered in the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, with the registration numbers being UMIN000002968 for the moxifloxacin study, UMIN000003644 for the simvastatin study, and UMIN000004173 for the meloxicam study. This study was conducted according to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and the ICH regulations on Good Clinical Practice. PK studies Demographic characteristics of the subjects in each study are presented in Table  1 . The mean body weight (BW) and body mass index (BMI) [and creatinine clearance (CCr) for the moxifloxacin study] were calculated for each group and were analyzed by analysis of variance ( anova ). Data on C max , AUC 48 , AUC inf  and CL/F were adjusted for a BW of 70 kg using the following equation (example for C max ): C max (corrected) = C max (uncorrected) × (BW/70). Dunnett's test was also employed for comparisons between the  Japanese  subjects and the other ethnic groups. All analyses were carried out using JMP9.3 software (SAS Institute  Japan ,  Tokyo ,  Japan ). Before enrolment in each study, subjects underwent a health check and were confirmed to be healthy (in particular, hepatic and renal function were confirmed to be within the normal range). Current smokers (or those who had stopped &lt;6 months previously) were excluded from the studies, as were persons who drank &gt;50 g of alcohol daily, those who abused recreational drugs, and those who had participated in another clinical trial within the previous 4 months. Each subject fasted overnight and received a single dose of the test drug orally with 150 mL of water on the morning of day 1 in the fasting state. In all three studies, total dietary calories and nutrients were matched in each study site (although the details of the menu were decided by the dietician at each site to fit the tastes of each ethnic group) to exclude the influence of diet on drug metabolism. In the simvastatin and meloxicam studies, subjects were prohibited from taking grapefruit juice or foods containing grapefruit, caffeine‐containing drinks including green tea, and other supplements and health foods for two weeks prior to the study. In all three studies, subjects were prohibited from taking any drugs, supplements or health foods from one week prior to the study until discharge from hospital. Subjects were only allowed to drink water for 4 hours after administration of each drug, and water hardness (&lt; 100 mg/L) was also matched among the study sites to exclude possible interactions between drugs and minerals in the water  24 ,  25 . In each study, a single batch of the test drug was used to avoid variation of bioavailability between different batches. Table 1 Demographic characteristics of the healthy male subjects

Significantly different ( P  &lt; 0.05) from Japanese by Dunnett's test. The mean ± SD of BW and BMI (also CCr for moxifloxacin) in the four groups showed statistical differences by  anova , so Dunnett's test was carried out for comparison with Japanese. All of these parameters were different in Caucasians, and some were different in Chinese and Koreans. In the moxifloxacin study, the target was to enrol 20 subjects at each study site. A dose of 400 mg of moxifloxacin was administered to each subject. Blood samples were taken from the forearm before and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h after dosing [the total blood volume collected was 115.0 mL ( Japanese ), 106.0 mL ( Chinese ), 107.0 mL (Koreans) and 130.5 mL (Caucasians)], while urine was collected over four time periods until 48 h after dosing (0–6, 6–12, 12–24 and 24–48 h). In the simvastatin study, 40 subjects were recruited at each study site, and a dose of 20 mg was administered. Blood samples were taken before and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h after dosing [the total blood volume collected was 127.0 mL ( Japanese ), 122.0 mL ( Chinese ), 119.0 mL (Koreans) and 142.5 mL (Caucasians)]. In the meloxicam study, 30 subjects were scheduled for enrolment at each site, and a dose of 7.5 mg was administered. Blood samples were taken before and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 h after dosing [the total blood volume collected was 125.0 mL ( Japanese ), 120.0 mL ( Chinese ), 117.0 mL (Koreans) and 140.5 mL (Caucasians)]. All of the study drugs were purchased in  China  and sent to the other participating countries to ensure use of the same drug batches. Moxifloxacin was a product of Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals ( Germany ), simvastatin was from Merck &amp; Co., Inc. ( USA ), and meloxicam was from Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH ( Germany ). Genotyping DNA for genotyping was prepared from whole blood samples of each subject. Genotyping of the  Japanese ,  Korean  and Caucasian subjects was carried out by the National Institute of Health Sciences (NIHS) ( Tokyo ,  Japan ), while genotyping of the  Chinese  subjects was performed by Biomedical Research, Ltd. at the Jiaxing Pharmacokinetics and Bioanalysis Center ( Shanghai ,  China ). In the moxifloxacin study, we determined the genotypes of  UGT1A1  by full sequencing of known activity‐reducing alleles * 6  and * 28  according to the method described previously  26 , because this drug is metabolized by UGT1A1  27 ,  28 . For the simvastatin study, genotyping of activity‐reducing  SLCO1B1  (521 T &gt; C, V174A) was performed using the  TaqMan  SNP Genotyping Assay (Life Technologies  Japan  Ltd.,  Tokyo ,  Japan )  29 . Meloxicam is metabolized to an inactive form by CYP2C9, so genotyping of activity‐reducing polymorphisms  CYP2C9 * 2  and  CYP2C9 * 3  was performed using a  TaqMan  SNP Genotyping Assay in the meloxicam study  29 . Analysis of the drugs and metabolites Drug concentrations were assayed in plasma and urine samples by validated high‐performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) methods. In the moxifloxacin study, the plasma and urine concentrations of moxifloxacin and its main metabolite (moxifloxacin glucuronide: M2) were measured according to the method reported by Raju  et al. 
 27 . All assays for the moxifloxacin study were performed at the Pharma Research Center for Preclinical Pharmacokinetics of Bayer HealthCare AG (Wuppertal,  Germany ). For simvastatin, the plasma concentrations of two forms of the parent compound (the lactone and open acid forms) and their metabolites were measured according to the method reported by Zhang  et al. 
 30 . All assays for the simvastatin study were performed at the SNBL Analytical Center in  Japan . Meloxicam was assayed according to the method of Yuan  et al. 
 31  at the SNBL Analytical Center in  Japan  ( Wakayama ,  Japan ). The details of each assay validation are presented in the Supplementary Materials. PK parameters and statistical analysis The following PK parameters were calculated using WinNonlin, version 5.2.1 (Pharsight Corporation, St. Louis, MO,  USA ) and model‐independent compartmental analysis: the time of the maximum drug concentration (T max ), the elimination half‐life (T 1/2 ), the maximum serum concentration (C max ), the area under the concentration  vs.  time curve (AUC) from time 0 to the last time of sampling (AUC 0‐tn ) or infinity (AUC inf ), the total clearance (CL), and the mean residence time (MRT). For moxifloxacin, the urinary recovery (%) (Σ(urinary concentration × urine volume)/dose × 100) and renal clearance (Σ(urinary concentration × urine volume)/AUC inf ) were also calculated. For statistical analyses, data on some parameters (C max , AUC 48 , AUC inf  and CL/F) were adjusted for a BW of 70 kg. Two‐sided confidence intervals were calculated for pairwise differences in the mean values of each parameter between the  Japanese  group and the other three ethnic groups.  anova  and Dunnett's test were used to assess the significance of differences in C max  and AUC inf  among the four ethnic groups. The influence of each of the alleles investigated on PK parameters was also analysed by Student  t ‐test using AUC inf  data for each genotype group, but not each ethnic group. These analyses were carried out using JMP9.3 software (SAS Institute  Japan ,  Tokyo ,  Japan ). Safety analysis For all studies, safety data were obtained during hospitalization. For safety analysis, symptoms and objective findings, vital signs, body weight and laboratory data (haematology tests, biochemistry tests and urinalysis) were evaluated by the investigators. At all participating sites, each study was conducted over a three‐month period. The studies of simvastatin and meloxicam were conducted more than six months after the study of moxifloxacin. Results Moxifloxacin study Twenty subjects each were enrolled in the  Japanese ,  Chinese  and Caucasian arms of the study, while there were 19 subjects in the  Korean  arm. BW was significantly different between the  Japanese  and Caucasian subjects, as well as the  Japanese  and  Korean  subjects. BMI showed a significant difference between the  Japanese  and Caucasian subjects, as well as the  Japanese  and  Chinese  subjects. CCr was also significantly different by  anova , but only a difference between  Japanese  and Caucasians was confirmed by Dunnett's test (Table  1 ). Figure  1  (A, B) shows the plasma profile of moxifloxacin and its metabolite M2 in each of the ethnic groups, while the BW‐adjusted PK plasma and urine parameters of moxifloxacin and M2 for each population are listed in Table  3  and displayed in Figure  2  (A–D).  anova  revealed significant differences in C max  and AUC inf  for the parent compound among the four groups (both  P  &lt; 0.0001). C max  also showed differences between  Japanese  and the other ethnic groups ( Chinese :  P  = 0.0024, Koreans:  P  &lt; 0.0001, Caucasians:  P  = 0.0087) by Dunnett's test, but AUC inf  only showed a significant difference between the  Japanese  and  Korean  groups by Dunnett's test ( P  = 0.0007).  anova  also identified significant differences in the C max  and AUC inf  of M2 among the ethnic groups ( P  = 0.0002 and  P  &lt; 0.0001, respectively). However, both parameters only showed a significant difference between  Japanese  and Caucasians by Dunnett's test ( P  = 0.0007 and  P  &lt; 0.0001). Table  3  lists the urinary recovery and renal clearance data for moxifloxacin and M2. Both the urinary recovery and renal clearance of moxifloxacin ( P  = 0.0118 and  P  &lt; 0.0001, respectively) and the urinary recovery of M2 ( P  = 0.0182) showed differences among the ethnic groups by  anova , but Dunnett's test only identified differences between  Chinese  and  Japanese  subjects for moxifloxacin ( P  = 0.0140 for the urinary recovery and  P  &lt; 0.0001 for renal clearance).

Figure  3  (A) shows that * 6  carriers had a significantly lower AUC inf  of M2 compared with the other genotypes (* 1 /* 28  and * 28 /* 28 :  P  = 0.0008, * 1 /* 1 :  P  &lt; 0.0001). However, metabolism of moxifloxacin itself was not influenced by variation of the  UGT1A1  genotype (C max :  P  = 0.4106, AUC inf :  P  = 0.3045, by  anova ). The * 6  allele of  UGT1A1  showed a higher frequency among East Asians than Caucasians (Table  2 ), suggesting that the lower frequency of the * 6  allele in Caucasians may have been responsible for the larger AUC inf  of M2. The frequency of * 28  was higher in Caucasians, but this did not cause an ethnic difference because the AUC of M2 did not differ between the * 28  and * 1 /* 1  populations. Concerning safety, 14 adverse events (AEs) were reported in 12 subjects and four events were considered to be related to the study drug (urticaria: one event in a  Japanese  subject, dizziness: two events in  Korean  subjects, and headache: one event in a Caucasian subject). All of these events were mild, except for one moderate episode of headache. There were no reports of QT prolongation.

 *2 (ND/ND/0.001/0.140), *3 (0.029/0.036/0.037/0.064). Simvastatin study Forty subjects were enrolled from each ethnic group. BW was significantly different between  Japanese  and Caucasians, while BMI showed a significant difference between  Japanese  and Caucasians as well as between  Japanese  and  Chinese  (Table  1 ). Figure  1  (C, D) displays the plasma profile of simvastatin and simvastatin acid in each ethnic group, while the BW‐adjusted PK parameters of simvastatin and simvastatin acid for each ethnic group are listed in Table  3  and shown in Figure  2  (E–H). There were significant differences in the C max  and AUC inf  of simvastatin among the four groups by  anova  ( P  = 0.0004 and 0.0328, respectively). Dunnett's test detected a significant difference in C max  between  Japanese  and Koreans ( P  = 0.0001), as well as between  Japanese  and Caucasians ( P  = 0.0066), but AUC inf  only showed a difference between  Japanese  and Caucasians ( P  = 0.0127). The C max  of simvastatin acid also showed significant differences among the ethnic groups by  anova  ( P  = 0.0002), but there was no significant difference between  Japanese  subjects and any of the other ethnic groups by Dunnett's test. AUC inf  values of simvastatin did not show any ethnic differences by  anova  ( P  = 0.3215) (Table  3 ). We also examined the influence of  SLCO1B1  genotype on the AUC inf  of simvastatin acid because it is a substrate of SLCO1B1. The frequency of variant alleles of  SLCO1B1  (c.521 T &gt; C, V174A) was higher in Caucasians than in East Asians (Table  2 ). We used Student's  t ‐test to examine whether heterozygous variation affected the mean AUC inf  and C max  values among all subjects. This analysis revealed that both the AUC inf  and C max  of simvastatin acid were significantly different between subjects with the wild‐type allele and subjects with variant alleles (both  P  &lt; 0.0001) [note: AUC inf  is shown in Figure  3  (B)]. These results suggested that the ratio of  SLCO1B1  variants in a study population could influence PK parameters. Regarding safety, ten AEs were reported in nine subjects, but only one event was related to the study drug (mild diarrhoea in a  Korean  subject).

Significant difference ( p  &lt; 0.05) vs. Japanese by Dunnett's test. Meloxicam study Thirty subjects were enrolled from each ethnic group, apart from the  Korean  arm of the study which had only 29 subjects. BW and BMI were significantly different between the  Japanese  and Caucasian subjects (Table  1 ). Figure  1  (E) shows the plasma profile of meloxicam in each ethnic group, while Table  3  and Figure  2  (I, J) list the PK parameters adjusted by BW. There was a significant difference in AUC inf  among the four ethnic groups by  anova  ( P  = 0.0003), but Dunnett's test only showed a difference between  Japanese  and Caucasians ( P  = 0.0006). C max  did not differ among the ethnic groups according to  anova  ( P  = 0.0529), although there have been previous reports of marked ethnic differences  31 ,  32 ,  33 . We also investigated the genotype of  CYP2C9 , the enzyme responsible for inactivation of meloxicam (Table  2 ). As reported previously  6 , the frequency of * 2  heterozygotes was higher in Caucasians than East Asians. However, the frequency of * 3  heterozygotes was similar among the four ethnic groups in this study, even though it was previously reported to be higher in Caucasians. When differences among three genotypes (wild‐type (* 1 /* 1 ),  1 /* 2 , and * 1 /* 3 ) were analyzed by  anova , there was no significant difference in C max  ( P  = 0.1785), but there was a difference in AUC inf  ( P  &lt; 0.0001). A difference in AUC inf  between * 1 /* 1  and * 1 /* 3  was also revealed by Dunnett's test ( P  &lt; 0.0001).  CYP2C9 *2/*2 showed higher AUC inf  than the wild‐type although there was only one carrier of * 2 /* 2 . Concerning safety, 23 AEs were reported in 18 subjects, and eight events were related to the study drug (uric acid increased, white blood cell count decreased, and haemoglobin decreased in one  Chinese  subject each; maculopapular rash, systemic skin rash, and irritating rash in one  Korean  subject each; and skin pruritus in two  Korean  subjects). All of these events were mild. In all three studies, no major ethnic differences in PK parameters were detected, even though there were some statistical differences in the parameters. Discussion Moxifloxacin is a new quinolone  34  for which PK studies have been conducted in several regions  35 ,  36  and large differences in PK parameters have been reported between  Japanese  and  Chinese  or  German  subjects. In the present study, the mean AUC inf  and C max  of the parent compound showed significant differences among East  Asian  groups by  anova , but there was only a difference between  Japanese  and Koreans by Dunnett's test. The reason for this difference between  Japanese  and Koreans is not clear. As there was no difference between  Chinese  and  Japanese  subjects, extrinsic factors that were not controlled in this study, such as capsaicin or other spices, may have been responsible  37 . The differences in the urine excretion rate and renal clearance of moxifloxacin between  Chinese  and  Japanese  subjects might also have been caused by unknown extrinsic factors. The AUC inf  of M2 was larger in Caucasians than in the three East  Asian  populations, and this finding was considered to be related to a difference in the frequency of the  UGT1A1 * 6  genotype. Concerning the * 28 /* 28  population, only one  Chinese  subject and one Caucasian subject had this polymorphism. Theoretically, they should have had higher AUC values of M2, but the AUC inf  and C max  values of both subjects were within the range for the * 1 /* 28  population. Since the * 28 /* 28  population was very small, data for the * 28 /* 28  and * 1 /* 28  populations are combined in Figure  3  (A). These results indicate that variations in the genotypes of metabolizing enzymes could potentially lead to ethnic differences in PK parameters for specific metabolites. However, the effect was not strong enough to significantly reduce clearance of the parent compound in our study of moxifloxacin. There have been many reports of large ethnic differences between Asians and Caucasians in the PK parameters of statins  38 ,  39 . Accordingly, we investigated simvastatin, as its maximum approved dose in the  USA  is four times higher than in  Japan  (package insert data), and the doses approved in  China  and  Korea  are also different from  Japan . Our study identified differences in the C max  of simvastatin between  Japanese  and Koreans, as well as between  Japanese  and Caucasians, but there were no differences in AUC inf  values among the East  Asian  groups. Even though the frequency of  SLCO1B1  genotypes differed, the AUC inf  of simvastatin acid was not significantly different among the four ethnic groups. Several other genetic factors have been reported to affect the AUC of simvastatin, including SLCO1B3, MRP2 and BCRP transporters  39 ,  40 , but SLCO1B1 has the strongest influence on statin metabolism. Even though there were some differences in  SLCO1B1  polymorphism among the four ethnic groups in the present study, these differences were not as large as those reported previously  6 . This discrepancy may have been caused by the lower frequency of  SLCO1B1 521C  in our Caucasian population, which minimized the difference between Caucasians and Asians. Meloxicam is a nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drug that is metabolized to its inactive form by CYP2C9. Therefore, it could be expected that the AUC of meloxicam would be larger in Caucasians than East Asians as the frequency of both  CYP2C9 * 2  and * 3  is higher in the general Caucasian population  6 . On the other hand, there have been reports that the AUC of meloxicam was higher in  Chinese  than in  Japanese  and Caucasians  24 ,  25 ,  26 . Accordingly, we also chose this drug to examine ethnic differences among East  Asian  populations. While we found no significant difference in C max  among the four ethnic populations, AUC inf  showed a difference between  Japanese  and Caucasians. With regard to  CYP2C9  genotype, the * 1 /* 3  and the * 2 /* 2  reduce CYP2C9 activity markedly and were associated with a larger AUC inf  of meloxicam, whereas the * 1 /* 2  causes less reduction of CYP2C9 activity. In the present study, the prevalence of the * 3  allele was similar among the four populations, but the * 2 /* 2  genotype carrier was involved in Caucasians, and this may help to explain the difference in AUC values between  Japanese  and Caucasians. There were some differences in BW‐adjusted PK parameters, especially for moxifloxacin. In all three studies, the  Japanese  subjects were smaller than those in the other ethnic groups, but BW‐adjusted data also showed differences. We controlled the study conditions as tightly as possible, especially for possible extrinsic factors, so these differences might have been diminished if the number of subjects had been larger. The reasons for the differences revealed by our PK studies are not clear. There have been some reports about inter‐individual and intra‐individual variability or inter‐occasion variability  41 ,  42 , and the present results may reflect such variability due to the influence of unknown intrinsic or extrinsic factors. Concerning the reasons for the discrepancies between our present results and previous reports, we can suggest the following possibilities. First, the previous studies were rather small and the genetic profile of the subjects was quite different. In this context, Oishi  et al . have stated that reported differences in the PK parameters of tolterodine that were found in small‐scale  Japanese  and  Korean  studies are responsible for misperceptions about ethnic differences  19 . Second, various extrinsic factors (such as the diet, mineral content of water, drug lot, etc.) have been suggested as potential causes of differences in PK parameters, and controlling such factors could be important for reducing apparent differences. In particular, food intake is known to influence the gastric emptying time of drugs and foods may contain ingredients that affect gut metabolizing enzymes/transporters, so that drug–food interactions in the gastrointestinal tract might influence PK  43 ,  44 . Moreover, we controlled the nutrients and calories of each meal, but not the menu, allowing the study sites to provide meals appropriate to each ethnic group. Third, other factors such as the sources or dosages of drugs, the drug batches, analytical techniques and timing of PK sample collection might have differed among the studies in the drug archive. Since most of the data were obtained from the literature or internal reports of companies, we could not perform precise comparison between archival data and our results. Early phase global studies are usually performed by matching the conditions of the subjects to some extent. If the diet and other extrinsic factors were more strictly controlled, so‐called ethnic differences might be reduced. Extrinsic impacts could be minimized and true ethnic differences could be better characterized if extrinsic factors were more strictly controlled in future studies. This present study was only conducted on male subjects and gender differences in PK parameters have been reported for some drugs  45 , so different results may have been obtained in women. However, most drugs have a similar PK profile in both genders, so we think that our results can be extrapolated to other drugs, including drugs under development. In conclusion, the present studies of moxifloxacin, simvastatin and meloxicam showed no major differences in PK parameters among male subjects from three East  Asian  populations and Caucasians when extrinsic factors were strictly controlled, and our findings also indicated that pharmacogenetic variations made an important contribution to the residual differences observed. Our findings suggest that drug development could be accomplished more efficiently if clinical trials are performed under appropriately controlled conditions.

    <Body>What is already known about this subject 
 There are safety concerns about antihypertensives in SARSCoV‐2 regulating ACE2 expression or activity. Observationally, the use of ACE inhibitors is not related to higher risk of COVID‐19 events, but might have potential benefits. These observations have not been confirmed in randomized controlled trials and the relation to immune function and inflammation is unclear. 
 What this study adds 
 Using Mendelian randomization in the largest available genome‐wide association studies to obtain uncounfounded associations, our study adds to the limited evidence on the role of antihypertensives in immune function and inflammation by revealing a complex pattern of effects of different classes of antihypertensive drugs. The observed effect of ACE inhibitors and the null effect of angiotensin II receptor blockers on key markers of immune function and inflammation support the current International Society of Hypertension statement. Indications of beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors on immune function and inflammation should be investigated. 
 1 INTRODUCTION Angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the binding domain of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS‐CoV) and SARSCoV‐2. 
 1 
  A key concern is that ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), commonly used antihypertensives, may increase ACE2 expression or activity, and thereby increase the risk of COVID‐19 infection. 
 2 
  Correspondingly, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), which do not affect ACE2 expression or activity, have been proposed as an alternative treatment. 
 2 
  In contrast, it has also been suggested that upregulation of ACE2 expression might protect against infection if binding of the coronavirus spike protein to ACE2 leads to ACE2 downregulation, 
 3 
  but the mechanism has not been assessed. Given the unclear role of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in infection, the International Society of Hypertension has stated “there is no good evidence to change the use of ACE‐inhibitors or ARBs for the management of raised blood pressure in the context of avoiding or treating COVID‐19 infection”. 
 4 
  Consistently, limited evidence from a small observational study suggests patients using ACE inhibitors or ARBs had higher CD3 and CD8 T cell counts. 
 5 
  Recent observational studies also show no association of use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs with risk of in‐hospital death in patients with COVID‐19.

  A potential benefit was seen with ACE inhibitor use, 
 6 
  but this “may be due to residual confounding” 
 9 
  and needs to be confirmed in clinical trials, as well as contextualized by mechanistic insight. In these circumstances when experimental evidence is lacking from drug testing, Mendelian randomization (MR) provides an alternative approach by exploiting genetic variants, randomly allocated at conception, that mimic drug effects. This study design has been successfully applied to assess the efficacy of several medications.

  Published genetic variants corresponding to the effects of a range of antihypertensives exist.

  Here, to be comprehensive we used these genetic variants to assess the effects of a comprehensive range of antihypertensives on key markers of immune function and inflammation related to COVID‐19, ie, lymphocyte percentage, neutrophil percentage and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF‐α). Severe COVID‐19 is associated with a major immune inflammatory response with abundant lymphocytes, neutrophils and excess inflammation. 
 15 
  Lymphocyte percentage is an established predictor of the severity of COVID‐19, 
 16 
  neutrophils are a modulator of immune response. 
 17 
  TNF‐α, an amplifier of inflammation, is important in acute inflammatory reactions; anti‐TNF therapy has recently been proposed as a promising COVID‐19 treatment strategy.

 2 METHODS 2.1 Study design We used an MR study to obtain unconfounded associations of the effects of antihypertensive drug use largely from published sources with lymphocyte percentage, neutrophil percentage and TNF‐α. Specifically, we used as instruments published genetic variants predicting the effects of the use of different classes of antihypertensive drugs from genes regulating the drug‐target proteins 
 12 
 ,  
 13 
  which were related to systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the UK Biobank. For ACE inhibitors, we also replicated our findings using genetic variants related both to ACE concentration and to SBP in the UK Biobank as instrument. As we used several different sets of instruments, for ease of comparison of the MR estimates, we used their genetic associations with SBP from the UK Biobank in 361 194 white British as a proxy for their effects on antihypertensives. 2.2 Exposure We obtained genetic instruments predicting the effects of the use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs and CCBs, as well as other classes of antihypertensives, specifically alpha‐adrenoceptor blockers, adrenergic neurone blocking drugs, beta‐adrenoceptor blockers, centrally acting antihypertensive drugs, loop diuretics, potassium sparing diuretics (PSDs) and aldosterone antagonists, renin inhibitors, thiazides and related diuretics, and vasodilator antihypertensives from published sources. 
 12 
 ,  
 13 
  Specifically, these published studies gave the genetic variants regulating the expression of the relevant drug target genes and selected the genetic variants related to SBP in different studies (UK Biobank summary statistics released in 2017 
 12 
  or meta‐analysis of UK Biobank and the International Consortium of Blood Pressure Genome‐wide Association Study [GWAS] 
 13 
 ), as summarized in Supporting Information Table  S1 . We further checked the genetic association of these published single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with SBP in the latest UK Biobank summary statistics ( http://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank/ ) in 361 194 white British, adjusted for age, age 2 , sex, interaction of sex with age, and with age 2  and 20 principal components, and kept the SNPs related to SBP in the updated summary statistics. Where several different published genetic predictors of the same drug classes existed, we provide estimates for all sets of predictors. The selection process and the resulting genetic predictors are summarized in Supporting Information Tables  S1  and  S2 . We also looked up these SNPs in Phenoscanner ( http://www.phenoscanner.medschl.cam.ac.uk/upload/ ), a platform with comprehensive genotype‐phenotype associations, to check whether these SNPs are associated with immune function or inflammation biomarkers. For ACE inhibitors, we also used as instruments serum ACE concentration, based on a published study in 4147 participants of European ancestry from the Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine INtervention (ORIGIN) cohort. 
 14 
  Specifically, the study provided 17 SNPs predicting serum ACE. For validity we selected SNPs also related to SBP in the UK Biobank as instrument in the main analysis, and used all these SNPs (if the SNP‐outcome association was available) in sensitivity analysis (Supporting Information Table  S2 ). 2.3 Outcomes Genetic associations with lymphocyte percentage and neutrophil percentage were obtained from UK Biobank summary statistics provided by Neale Lab ( http://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank/ ). The UK Biobank is a large, ongoing, prospective cohort study with median follow‐up time of 11.1 years. 
 18 
  It recruited 502 713 people (intended to be aged 40‐69 years, mean age 56.5 years, 45.6% men) from 2006 to 2010 in England, Scotland and Wales, 94% of self‐reported European ancestry. Here, the genetic associations are based on 361 194 white British (167 020, 46% men), adjusted for age, age 2 , sex, interaction of sex with age, and with age 2  and 20 principal components. Genetic associations with inverse normal transformed TNF‐α concentration were obtained from a large GWAS (n = 24 925) in people of European ancestry, mean age 44.6 years, 55% women, 
 19 
  adjusted for age, sex, body mass index and the first ten genetic principal components. 2.4 Statistical analysis MR estimates were based on the SNP‐specific Wald estimates (genetic association with outcome divided by genetic association with the exposure), meta‐analysed using inverse variance weighting with multiplicative random effects, as necessary. In sensitivity analysis, we used different methods with different assumptions about potential bias from horizontal pleiotropy, including Mendelian randomization pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR‐PRESSO), a mode‐based method, and contamination mixture method. MR‐PRESSO is able to identify outliers with potential horizontal pleiotropy amongst multiple genetic variants and provide a corrected estimate after removing these outliers. 
 20 
  The mode‐based method assumes the true causal effect is the value taken by the largest number of genetic variants, 
 21 
  so it is robust to outliers, 
 22 
  but the estimates are generally conservative. 
 21 
  The contamination mixture method is similar but less conservative than the mode‐based method. 
 21 
 ,  
 23 
 
 All statistical analyses were conducted using R version 3.6.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), and the R package “MendelianRandomization”. 2.5 Ethical approval All the estimates of genetic associations were taken from publicly available summary statistics, obtained from studies previously collected with informed consent, without any personal information in the study. 3 RESULTS 3.1 Genetic instruments We used one SNP (rs4968783 in  ACE ) for ACE inhibitors, one SNP for ARBs (rs118123032 in  AGTR1 ) and 12 SNPs for CCBs scaled to SBP (effect sizes) using UK Biobank summary statistics. 
 12 
  We also used one SNP (rs4291 in  ACE ) for ACE inhibitors and 24 SNPs for CCBs derived based on a GWAS meta‐analysis of the UK Biobank and the International Consortium of Blood Pressure. 
 13 
  For the 17 SNPs predicting ACE concentration, two SNPs (and also their proxies) were not available in the UK Biobank, leaving 15 SNPs. Of these only three SNPs were also related to SBP in the UK Biobank and retained. In sensitivity analysis, we used all the 15 SNPs as instruments (Supporting Information Table  S2 ). For the other classes of antihypertensives, we used eight SNPs in  ADRA2A ,  TH ,  ADRA1D ,  ADRA1B  and  ADRA1A  for alpha‐adrenoceptor blockers; three SNPs in  ADRA2A  and  KCNJ1  for adrenergic neurone blocking drugs; 10 SNPs in  ADRB1 ,  ADRA1D ,  ADRB2 ,  ADRA1B ,  KCNH2 ,  ADRA1A  and  ADRB3  for beta‐adrenoceptor blockers; six SNPs in  ADRA2A ,  GABRA5 ,  NISCH ,  GABRA2  and  GABRA6  for centrally acting antihypertensive drugs; three SNPs in  SLC12A1 ,  SLC12A2  and  SLC12A5  for loop diuretics; three SNPs in  SCNN1D ,  SCNN1B  and  NR3C2  for PSDs and aldosterone antagonists; one SNP in  REN  for renin inhibitors, seven SNPs in  GABRB3 ,  GABRG3 ,  SLC12A1 ,  GABRG1 ,  GABRB2 ,  GABRA6  and  CA1  for thiazides and related diuretics; and nine SNPs in  NPR1 ,  KCNJ1 ,  PTGIR ,  PDE5A ,  EDNRA  and  CA1  for vasodilator antihypertensives (Supporting Information Table  S2 ). None of the genetic variants are directly related to immune function in Phenoscanner. 3.2 Effects on immune and inflammatory markers The genetically predicted effects of the use of ACE inhibitors and CCBs both increased lymphocyte percentage and decreased neutrophil percentage, with a larger effect size for ACE inhibitors (Table  1 ). The estimates for ACE inhibitors were robust to using genetic variants predicting ACE concentration (Table  2 ). The genetically predicted effects of ARBs did not affect lymphocyte percentage or neutrophil percentage (Table  1 ). The estimates for ACE inhibitors and CCBs were consistent using published genetic variants derived based on the UK Biobank 
 12 
  or on the meta‐analysis of the UK Biobank and the International Consortium of Blood Pressure 
 13 
  (Table  1 ). Two other classes of antihypertensives, ie, PSDs and aldosterone antagonists (such as spironolactone) as well as vasodilator antihypertensives (such as ambrisentan), also showed similar effects to ACE inhibitors and CCBs on immune markers, ie, they increased lymphocyte percentage and decreased neutrophil percentage (Table  3 ).

CCBs, PSDs and aldosterone antagonists, and vasodilator antihypertensives similarly increased lymphocyte percentage and decreased neutrophil percentage, but were unrelated to TNF‐α. However, other antihypertensives, including ARBs, which also increase ACE2 expression, had no effect on immune markers or inflammation. As such, consistent with the statement from the International Society of Hypertension 
 4 
  and previous observational studies, 
 6 
 ,  
 7 
 ,  
 8 
  our findings do not suggest use of antihypertensive drugs based on their role in ACE2 expression, but do not exclude the possibility of their use based on effects on the immune system. Lower lymphocyte percentage is predictive of higher severity of COVID‐19 infection. 
 16 
  Anti‐TNF drugs have been hypothesized as a potential treatment for COVID‐19 infection. 
 15 
  As such, the associations of ACE inhibitors with higher lymphocyte, lower neutrophil and possibly lower TNF‐α are not consistent with the hypothesis that ACE inhibitors impair immune function and increase the risk of infection. Given the complex immune response to COVID‐19 infection, these associations should not be interpreted as a protective role of ACE inhibitors on infection. in vivo experiments suggest ACE inhibitors, such as captopril, do not reduce SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. 
 24 
  Effects via modulating the immune reaction have not been assessed. A beneficial association of the use of ACE inhibitors with COVID mortality has been observed in a systematic review and meta‐analysis of observational studies. 
 25 
  ACE inhibitors might affect immune function and inflammation via expression of ACE2. However, ARBs, which also affect ACE2 expression, had different effects from ACE inhibitors. The target domain of COVID‐19, ACE2, has high expression in the testes.

  Sex hormones modulate immune response and inflammation in animals. 
 28 
  Testosterone is generally immunosuppressive, while oestrogen tends to be immune‐promoting. 
 29 
 ,  
 30 
  Genetically predicted testosterone was associated with lower lymphocyte percentage in a recent MR study. 
 31 
  Statins, which lower testosterone, 
 32 
  have been hypothesized to be protective for COVID‐19 
 33 
  by modulation of NF‐κB, 
 34 
  mediated by TNF‐α. 
 35 
  Further investigation of these mechanistic pathways might help find a unifying explanation for differences in patterns of COVID‐19 by sex and setting, similar to differences in other hormone‐modulated conditions by setting.

 37 
 
 Despite consistency across genetic instruments, this study has several limitations. First, MR relies on three assumptions, ie, the genetic instruments are related to the exposure, are not related to potential confounders and the effect of the genetic instrument on the outcome is exclusively through the exposure. 
 38 
  To satisfy these assumptions, we used SNPs related to the expression of genes regulating the drug target proteins. We also checked that these SNPs are not directly related to immune function, although we cannot exclude the possibility that unidentified pleiotropic association may exist, which is a common limitation of MR studies. However, we compared the estimates using different SNP selections, which gave consistent findings. Given the possibility of unidentified pleiotropy, we used several different analytic methods that are based on different assumptions. The consistent directions of associations across these methods add confidence to the findings. These methods may differ in precision, for example the estimates from mode‐based methods are generally more conservative than the contamination mixture method, 
 21 
  so they are used as sensitivity analysis supplementary to the main analysis. Second, measurement error might exist in the single time‐point assay of lymphocyte percentage, neutrophil percentage and TNF‐α. However, any measurement error should be nondifferential, thus bias towards the null, rather than give positive associations with lymphocyte percentage and inverse associations with neutrophil percentage. Third, the genetic associations with TNF‐α were obtained from a relatively small GWAS, which might explain the wide confidence intervals in the association of ACE inhibitors with TNF‐α. The associations were also adjusted for body mass index, which can cause a bias in some situations, 
 39 
  but is unlikely to do so here. 
 40 
  The study was also limited by the few large GWAS of immunity, thus replication in other large GWAS when they are available will be worthwhile. Fourth, genetic associations with neutrophil and lymphocyte percentages were taken from the participants of UK Biobank, who are healthier than the general population, 
 41 
  so the estimates might be underestimated and the MR estimates may not be applicable to patients with infections. However, the direction of associations should be consistent, which adds to the limited evidence of these antihypertensives in immune function and inflammation. Fifth, the associations in Europeans may not apply to other populations, such as Asians. However, causal effects should be consistent across settings. Sixth, genetic effects might be diluted by compensatory processes or feedback mechanisms. 
 42 
  The compensation would be expected to mitigate the genetic effects, thus biasing toward the null, which may explain some null associations such as CCBs and testosterone. The effect sizes of the associations are relatively small, which may not be clinically significant, but a small effect size may still matter for population health, 
 43 
  especially for antihypertensive drugs which are commonly used. In addition, MR study is more useful in determining the direction of causation than the magnitude of an effect size, 
 44 
  so the effect on immune function and inflammation might not be comparable to the short‐term effect of taking antihypertensive drugs. From the perspective of clinical practice, our findings do not support the replacement of ACE inhibitors with CCBs because they have similar effects on key markers of immune function, although different effects on inflammation. Our findings suggest a role of ACE inhibitors in immune function and inflammation, but this may not be due to, or at least not totally due to, ACE2 expression because ARBs which also affect ACE2 expression did not affect lymphocyte percentage, neutrophil percentage or TNF‐α. Exploring the underlying pathways, especially the pathways that differ between these antihypertensives, would be worthwhile. 5 CONCLUSION The effect of ACE inhibitors and the null effect of ARBs on key markers of immune function and inflammation support the current International Society of Hypertension statement that there is no evidence to indicate the use of antihypertensive drugs based on their role in ACE2 expression. However, concern about the effects of ACE inhibitors on immune function has revealed a complex pattern of effects of different classes of antihypertensive drugs whose elucidation might be relevant to both infectious diseases and optimization of the use of antihypertensives which should be further explored.

    <Body>WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT An unfavourable risk profile for myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with various lifestyle factors and co-morbidities that are more prevalent among patients with severe mental illness. Patient populations that are prescribed antipsychotic agents have a higher cardiovascular mortality rate than the general population. The association between the use of antipsychotic agents and any increase in the risk of MI is unclear. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS The aim of this systematic literature review was to assess the relationship between antipsychotic agents and MI. Substantial clinical and methodological heterogeneity between the five studies in this review led to an inconclusive answer to the question whether the use of antipsychotics is associated with the incidence of MI in adults. The largest study had a favourable internal validity compared with the other studies and did not find an association between the use of antipsychotic agents and an increased risk of MI. Objectives Patient populations that are prescribed antipsychotic agents have higher mortality rates than those of a representative healthy comparison population [ 1 – 3 ]. The excess mortality in these patient groups can partly be attributed to a two-fold higher cardiovascular death rate [ 1 ,  4 – 6 ]. The observed over expected numbers of deaths from cardiovascular causes in patients with schizophrenia has increased from 1.7 for both men and women in 1976–1980 to 8.3 for men and to 5.0 for women over a 20 year period during which the use of antipsychotics has become more widespread [ 7 ]. Patients experiencing psychoses and in need of antipsychotic agents may be at a higher risk of myocardial infarction (MI) regardless of any effect of antipsychotic medication [ 8 – 11 ]. An unfavourable risk profile for MI is associated with various lifestyle factors and co-morbidities that are more prevalent in patients with a mental illness [ 12 – 16 ]. The association between the use of antipsychotic agents and any increase in cardiovascular morbidity or mortality is unclear, with some studies reporting increased risks for patients prescribed high doses of antipsychotics whilst other studies have found no such association [ 3 ,  17 ,  18 ]. This systematic review set out to perform an extensive literature search on the association between antipsychotics and MI and to summarize the findings of the individual studies. The central research question in this systematic review was: ‘Is the use of antipsychotics associated with the incidence of MI in adults?’ Methods Data sources Individual studies were identified using multiple sources. Bibliographies used included Pubmed, Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and Psychinfo. References of the identified articles were used to track relevant articles not identified in the original search. The searches were performed by an epidemiologist (RB), initially in December 2009, with the main database searches updated in October 2010 and May 2011. The search strategy applied combined the following terms: ‘Antipsychotic* AND agents’ (this term includes the following subheadings: ‘antipsychotic* AND drugs’, ‘antipsychotic*, ‘major AND tranquilizers’, ‘neuroleptic* AND agents’, ‘neuroleptic*’, ‘tranquilizing AND agent’) OR ‘Psychotropic*’ OR ‘Dopamine antagonist’ OR ‘Mental* AND ill*’ OR ‘Psychot* AND ill*’ OR ‘Schizophrenia’ AND ‘Myocardial infarction’ OR ‘Coronary heart disease’. The search was limited to studies of subjects aged 18 years or over. Inclusion and exclusion criteria All therapeutic and aetiologic studies of antipsychotic agents using MI as a primary or secondary outcome measure were included. Study populations were all patients who had been prescribed an antipsychotic agent at least once in their medical history, allowing for studies to measure ever, past, current and/or cumulative use of antipsychotics. If possible, depending on the studies identified, secondary study populations were patients grouped by psychiatric diagnoses. Studies had to compare therapy with antipsychotic agents  vs.  no therapy, placebo or alternative medication and had to be at least 12 months in duration. Studies comparing the efficacy and safety of different antipsychotic agents with each other have not been included in this review. Procedure Information on key variables was collected to summarize the individual studies and to make comparisons between the studies. The result of interest was the effect of antipsychotic agents on the incidence of MI, expressed as an odds ratio (OR) or relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Information on both crude and adjusted results as well as dose–response relationships and the results of relevant sub-analyses concerning gender, age and history of cardiovascular disease were all recorded. Results We identified two case-control studies, one nested case-control study and two historic cohort studies using the procedure shown in  Figure 1 [ 19 – 23 ]. Three studies compared the risk of MI amongst typical antipsychotic users with the risk of MI in users of other psychotropic medications [ 19 – 21 ]. The two remaining studies investigated the association between MI and the use of atypical antipsychotics or typical antipsychotics or both  vs.  no use of antipsychotic agents [ 22 ,  23 ]. There was substantial clinical and methodological heterogeneity between the studies (see  Table 1 ).

Exposed controls: 4511 Pratt  et al . [ 21 ] conducted a historic cohort study of United States survey data. The study population consisted of a random group of interviewed household residents divided in three categories: (i) individuals who had met the criteria for Major Depressive Episode (MDE), (ii) individuals with dysphoria and (iii) individuals without MDE or dysphoria. The 1551 subjects were originally part of a cohort of 3481 Baltimore residents. The adjusted OR for ‘ever’ use of phenothiazines was 2.92 (95% CI 1.23, 6.98). A matched historic cohort study using data of a health care company in the United States provided information on the association between antipsychotic use and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Enger  et al . [ 22 ] followed 11 400 cohort participants of whom 1920 were patients with schizophrenia using antipsychotics. The adjusted RR for risk of MI amongst typical antipsychotic users (RR 5.34, 95% CI 1.75, 16.30) was higher than the adjusted RR for risk of MI amongst atypical antipsychotic users (RR 1.66, 95% CI 0.19, 14.82) and the adjusted RR for risk of MI by current typical and atypical antipsychotic use (RR 5.22, 95% CI 1.22, 22.40). Thorogood  et al . [ 19 ] conducted a matched case-control study using national death certificates supplied by the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys in Wales and England to identify cases of fatal MI. One hundred and sixty-one women were matched to 309 controls by age, marital status and general practitioner. The RR for ever use of a phenothiazine was 6.2 (95% CI 2.0, 19.1). The RR could not be calculated for current use of phenothiazines (within 90 days of death) as none of the controls had experienced the outcome of interest. The RR for ever use of thioxanthene was 4.6 (95% CI 0.90, 24) and higher than the RR for current use of thioxanthene (RR 2.0, 95% CI 0.3, 14.2). Penttinen &amp; Valonen [ 20 ] conducted a nested case-control study in Finland using cohort data of 3172 male farmers who participated in a postal questionnaire concerning working conditions, lifestyle and various diseases and symptoms. Eighty-three men who experienced a MI were identified via hospital discharge registries. These cases were free of ischaemic heart disease at the start of follow-up and were each matched to three controls by age, smoking habit, social status and county of residence. The OR for MI amongst ever users of neuroleptic agents was 1.5 (95% CI 0.40, 6.0). A matched case-control study using national health services registries in Denmark found no association between a first-time hospitalization for MI and current or former use of antipsychotic agents. Nakagawa  et al . [ 23 ] matched 21 377 patients who were hospitalized with MI with 106 885 controls by age, gender and county of residence. The adjusted RR for current conventional antipsychotic use was 0.99 (95% CI 0.96, 1.03) and similar to the adjusted RR for current atypical antipsychotic use (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88, 1.09). Subgroup analyses Subgroup-analyses were performed by Nakagawa  et al . [ 23 ]. The effect of antipsychotic agents on the risk of first-time hospitalization of MI was not influenced by gender (see  Table 1 ), age or previous cardiovascular disease nor by the cumulative number of daily-defined dosages [ 23 ]. Enger  et al . found an inverse dose-response relationship when the group with the smallest ratio of dispensed days to total days (0–0.3] was used as a reference group (see  Table 2 [ 22 ]). Between study comparisons The definitions used to identify cases of MI differed widely. MI was measured subjectively by Pratt  et al . [ 21 ]. The relative validity and completeness of each objective source differed. Nakagawa  et al . included first-time hospitalizations for MI only, whereas Thorogood  et al . [ 19 ] included only fatal cases of MI. Penttinen &amp; Valonen [ 20 ] used a mix of incident cases of MI that were either hospitalized or had died as a result of their MI. Enger  et al . [ 22 ] included both prevalent and incident cases of MI. All studies used heterogeneous sources of medication records and different types of medication. Thorogood  et al . [ 19 ] looked specifically into two types of conventional psychotic agents (thioxanthene and phenothiazine). Pratt  et al . [ 21 ] and Penttinen &amp; Valonen [ 20 ] limited the analysis to phenothiazines only and Nakagawa  et al . [ 23 ] and Enger  et al . [ 22 ] grouped all typical and atypical agents together. The recording of the date of starting and stopping antipsychotic agents also differed between studies. Pratt  et al . [ 21 ] and Penttinen &amp; Valonen [ 20 ] did not measure the time of antipsychotic use and consequentially no difference between current and past use was made, nor was information given on cumulative exposure. Almost half of all the cohort members in the study by Pratt  et al . [ 21 ]had either died or were lost -to-follow-up before the study had ended. Likewise, almost 40% of the cohort members in the study by Enger  et al . [ 22 ] had left the claims database before the study ended. It is not known what proportion of patients who ended their study enrolment prematurely experienced an MI. Three studies used heterogeneous study populations. The indication for which patients received antipsychotic treatment was not shown by Thorogood  et al . [ 19 ], Penttinen &amp; Valonen [ 20 ] and Nakagawa  et al . [ 23 ]. The study by Enger  et al . [ 22 ] only included patients with schizophrenia who were treated with antipsychotic agents and could not control for the disease underlying the prescription of antipsychotics. Pratt  et al . [ 21 ] adjusted for a history of major depressive episode. The studies by Thorogood  et al . [ 19 ] and Penttinen &amp; Valonen [ 20 ] included only female subjects and male subjects respectively and were published without the clinical and demographic characteristics of the participants, limiting the generalizability of their results. The size of the study populations ranged from a few hundred subjects to more than 100 000. The four studies with the smallest number of events reported moderate to strong effects of typical antipsychotic agents on the incidence of MI [ 19 – 22 ]. The internal validity of the largest study by Nakagawa  et al . [ 23 ] compared favourably with all other studies (see  Table 2 ). Nakagawa  et al . reported no association between the use of any type of antipsychotic agent and the experience of a MI [ 23 ]. Discussion The aim of this systematic literature review was to assess the relationship between antipsychotic agents and myocardial infarction, a drug-event pair that has not been systematically reviewed previously. The five observational studies that were the focus of this review conducted a primary or secondary analysis addressing the research question of interest. The use of typical antipsychotics was associated with an increase in the risk of MI in four studies with a small number of events. Two studies investigated the association between MI and the use of atypical antipsychotics and found no association and a weak association respectively. These results need to be interpreted with caution as the estimates of effect size varied greatly between studies and confidence intervals for these studies finding an effect were wide. None of the studies reported a protective effect of the use of antipsychotics on the risk of MI. The review had several limitations. The review was restricted to published studies written in English that included adult populations. No randomized controlled trials were identified. None of the studies provided information with regard to the prescription of antipsychotic agents via psychiatric services and there was a lack of information with regard to treatment compliance. The study populations in all five studies, the course of their diseases, the source and type of medication, the covariates, the study outcomes and study sizes differed substantially between studies which may have influenced the difference in results between all five studies. Between-study comparisons of studies conducted in the early 1990s and those conducted more than a decade later are likely to have been influenced by trends in MI incidence and case-fatality as well as trends in the prescription of antipsychotic medication and of medication for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The studies conducted in 1992 and 1996 could not include any information on the use of atypical antipsychotic agents. Residual confounding is likely to have influenced the results of the studies conducted in 1992 and 1996 as the adjustments of the crude associations were not as comprehensive as those made in later studies. Lifestyle factors were not accounted for or through proxy variables in all five studies. Three of the studies included in this review were conducted amongst patients using antipsychotics from the general population, whereas two studies specifically estimated a relative risk for MI in patients with schizophrenia and MDE respectively. As severe mental illness in general, and schizophrenia in particular, is associated with both the prescription of antipsychotic agents and a change in the risk of MI, the results of the individual studies are likely to have been affected by confounding by indication [ 3 ,  22 ]. Any difference in risk of MI that is reported in patient populations with a severe mental illness, who are also prescribed antipsychotic agents, may not be causally related to the use of the antipsychotic agent, but to factors relating to the underlying disease. Both typical and atypical agents increase the risk of prolonged QT interval and torsades de pointes [ 24 ]. Observational studies using administrative data of patients who are prescribed antipsychotic agents have found a two-fold increase in risk of ventricular arrhythmias compared with patient populations not taking antipsychotic agents [ 25 ,  26 ]. It is not known through which mechanism the use of antipsychotics influences the risk of MI. Patient populations for whom antipsychotic agents are indicated differ considerably from healthy comparison populations, making it complicated to disentangle the various determinants that influence the risk of MI in users of antipsychotics [ 8 – 10 ,  27 – 29 ]. First time use of antipsychotics has been associated with a change in risk markers for cardiovascular events [ 30 ]. Any effect of antipsychotic agents on the risk of MI could be mediated by risk factors of MI that are more prevalent in patients suffering from psychoses. Conclusion Substantial clinical and methodological heterogeneity between the studies in this review led to an inconclusive answer to the question whether the use of antipsychotics is associated with the incidence of MI in adults. The largest study did not find an association between the use of antipsychotic agents and an increased risk of MI. Future studies designed to investigate the coronary side-effects of antipsychotic agents are recommended, paying attention to the strong possibility of confounding by indication. A case-only approach such as the self-controlled case series may be one solution; comparisons are made within individuals who have both the event and exposure of interest and therefore fixed confounders are completely controlled for. </Body>

    <Body>1 What is already known about this subject 
 Using an approach where in total only 1% of a therapeutic dose of 3 FXa inhibitors is administered simultaneously, a drug interaction study with ketoconazole predicts precisely the known magnitude of inhibition for each of the 3 drugs when given as a therapeutic dose. A minimal risk for the study participants is associated with the use of FXa inhibitors when using the microdose approach. 
 What this study adds 
 With a single study, valid drug interaction data for several victim drugs can be concurrently obtained in the same participants. Especially for a new drug class, knowledge on drug interactions is often limited. This microdose cocktail offers the opportunity to generate mechanistic insights into drug–drug interactions with the new drug class of FXaI and can help to elucidate FXaI clearance mechanisms completely. This approach might be a valuable tool because it identifies the impact of currently unknown drug–drug interactions with all European Medicines Agency‐approved FXaI. 
 2 INTRODUCTION A new class of anticoagulants—the  factor X a inhibitors (FXaI)—has been introduced in the last decade; these are increasingly used for the prevention of thromboembolic events in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, 
 1 
  the prevention and treatment of pulmonary embolism, and the prevention and treatment deep vein thrombosis. 
 2 
  FXaI pharmacokinetics are linked to their pharmacodynamics, efficacy and safety. 
 3 
  It has been claimed that FXaI have fewer interactions with food and drugs in comparison to vitamin K antagonists. 
 4 
  Clearance mechanisms of FXaI vary substantially between representatives of this class.  Apixaban ,  edoxaban  and  rivaroxaban  are all substrates of cytochrome P450 isozymes (predominantly  CYP3A4 ) and efflux transporters, such as  P‐glycoprotein  (P‐gp) and the  Breast Cancer Resistance Protein  (BCRP), albeit to varying extents.

  Therefore, these FXaI are prone to be victims of perpetrators drugs altering the activity of CYP isozymes and/or drug transporters.

 11 
  However, due to differences in their clearance mechanisms, evidence obtained with 1 FXal cannot be extrapolated to other class members and, thus, each FXaI has to be studied individually with a number of different perpetrators. A cocktail approach using microdoses of the 3 FXaI could reduce the number of studies and enable the possibility to compare the data within the same subjects for all 3 FXaI at once. Using this microdosed FXaI cocktail approach with 25 μg apixaban, 50 μg edoxaban and 25 μg rivaroxaban, we have recently shown that  ketoconazole's  drug interactions with therapeutic FXal doses could precisely be predicted with this microdose cocktail. 
 12 
  The exposure changes, expressed as the ratio of the area under the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC) with and without ketoconazole, as a measure of the drug interaction effect were 1.90 for apixaban, 2.35 for edoxaban and 2.27 for rivaroxaban. 
 12 
  These results are well comparable to drug–drug interaction trials at therapeutic doses of apixaban (1.99 
 11 
 ), edoxaban (1.87 
 10 
 ) and rivaroxaban (1.82 single‐dose, 200 mg ketoconazole; and 2.58 steady‐state, 400 mg ketoconazole). 
 5 
 
 To further evaluate the suitability of this FXaI microdosing approach, 3 different paradigm perpetrators ( cobicistat ,  rifampicin  and voriconazole) were studied in the same participants as an extension of the earlier ketoconazole drug interaction trial. The aim was to generate interaction data of the 3 victim FXaI simultaneously using a total dose of 100 μg. In addition, the effect of these paradigm perpetrators on CYP3A activity and, thus, the contribution of the CYP3A pathway to FXaI clearance pathways was measured by the established microdosed  midazolam  methodology.

  Furthermore, coagulation parameters were monitored to assess the safety of this approach. 3 METHODS The study protocol (EudraCT 2016–003024‐23) was approved by the responsible Ethics Committee of Heidelberg University Hospital, Germany and the competent authority (BfArM, Bonn, Germany). The study was performed at the Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacoepidemiology at Heidelberg University Hospital (Heidelberg, Germany) in accordance with the actual declaration of Helsinki. Before inclusion in the clinical trial, each participant signed a written declaration of informed consent. 3.1 Study population Eighteen healthy Caucasian women ( n  = 11) and men ( n  = 7; 18–56 years; body mass index of 19.8–29.7 kg/m 2  and haemoglobin concentrations &gt;11 g/dL) participated and completely finished the trial. No regular drug intake within the last 2 weeks except for oral contraceptives was permitted and a participation in other clinical trials within 6 weeks before inclusion was not allowed. Additional details have previously been reported.

 3.2 Study design After the randomised cross‐over part using ketoconazole and the FXaI cocktail alone, 
 12 
  an additional trial part was amended in which the same 18 participants (7 male, 11 female) were randomised to 1 of 3 treatments (6 participants each; Figure  1 ):
 Voriconazole: (Voriconazol‐ratiopharm, ratiopharm GmbH, Ulm, Germany; 3 male, 3 female). Two doses of voriconazole (400 mg orally) were administered starting 24.5 and 12.5 hours before FXaI administration and were followed by 4 doses of voriconazole (200 mg orally) 30 minutes before and 11.5, 23.5, and 35.5 h after FXaI administration. Rifampicin: (Eremfat, RIEMSER Pharma GmbH, Greifswald, Germany); 1 male, 5 female). A single oral dose of 600 mg rifampicin was administered 30 minutes before FXaI administration. Cobicistat (administered as the combination product Genvoya [cobicistat/elvitegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide fumarate, Gilead Sciences International Ltd., Cambridge, UK]; 3 male, 3 female). In total, 3 doses of Genvoya containing 150 mg of cobicistat, 150 mg of elvitegravir, 200 mg of emtricitabine and 10 mg of tenofovir alafenamide fumarate were administered 24.5 and 0.5 hours before and 23.5 hours after FXaI administration. Immediately after each FXaI administration, an oral solution of 10 μg midazolam (Dormicum V 5 mg/5 mL, Roche Pharma AG, Grenzach‐Wyhlen, Germany) was administered. Oral stock solutions of each FXaI were prepared and provided by the hospital pharmacy according to a pharmaceutical development protocol approved by the competent authority (BfArM, Bonn, Germany). Each FXaI solution was prepared in a separate bottle containing 2.5 μg/mL apixaban, 30 μg/mL edoxaban and 2.5 μg/mL rivaroxaban. Oral solutions were freshly prepared by dilution of the stock solutions in 1 step 30 minutes before administration. For rivaroxaban and apixaban, 10 mL stock solution, and for edoxaban, 1.66 mL stock solution were transferred into ~100 mL tap water in a plastic cup yielding final doses of 25 μg rivaroxaban, 25 μg apixaban, and 50 μg edoxaban. FIGURE 1 Study flow diagram of the complete study with  n  = 18 study participants.

On the FXaI pharmacokinetic study days, blood samples (LiHep tubes) were collected before and 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 32 and 48 hours after administration. To assess CYP3A activity, blood samples (LiHep tubes) were taken before and 2, 2.5, 3 and 4 hours after the midazolam microdose. 
 15 
  Urine was collected for 48 hours in 2 24‐hour periods. Blood samples were immediately centrifuged for 10 minutes at 4°C and 2500  g.  The separated plasma and 10 mL urine aliquots were stored at −20°C until analysis. Additional blood samples (citrate 3.2%) to quantify international normalised ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) were taken at the screening visit, 2 hours after FXaI administration (in each study part, expected peak concentration [C max ]), and at the end of the study. 3.4 Quantification of FXaI and midazolam A previously published ultra‐performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method was used to quantify midazolam concentrations in plasma. 
 15 
  Plasma concentrations of apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban were analysed using an ultra‐sensitive ultra‐performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry assay. 
 12 
 ,  
 16 
  All assays fulfilled the pertinent guidelines on bioanalytical method validation of the US Food and Drug Administration 
 17 
  and the European Medicines Agency 
 18 
  with accuracy and precision values of ≤ ± 15%. The lower limits of quantification were 0.093 pg/mL for midazolam and 2.5 pg/mL for each FXaI. 3.5 Calculations and statistical analysis Standard pharmacokinetic parameters of each FXaI were determined using Kinetica 5.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The following pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by a noncompartmental analysis using plasma concentrations of apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban: C max , time to C max  (t max ), terminal elimination half‐life (t 1/2 ), AUC 0‐∞ , volume of distribution (V ss /F) and apparent oral clearance (Cl/F). AUCs were calculated by a mixed log‐linear model. Renal clearance was calculated as amount excreted unchanged in urine divided by AUC. Nonrenal clearance is the difference between Cl/F and renal clearance. AUC ratio (AUCR) is the quotient of AUC of FXaI during the perpetrator divided by AUC of the FXaI alone; the C max  ratio was calculated correspondingly. Descriptive statistics were calculated for each treatment and each pharmacokinetic parameter with geometric mean and the respective 95% confidence interval listed in the result tables. The statistical model used for the analysis of AUC 0‐∞  and C max  of each perpetrator interaction ( n  = 6) with each FXaI is a repeated measures ANOVA (analysis of variance) for a cross‐over design after logarithmic transformation. The 90% confidence intervals for the ratios were calculated by re‐transformation of the logarithmic results. Graphical and statistical analysis was done with Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). In addition, the effect of the paradigm perpetrators on the CYP3A marker substance midazolam was tested equally. Point estimates (geometric mean ratios) and the 90% confidence intervals for the pairwise ratios of AUC 2–4  and estimated metabolic clearance (eCl met ) were calculated.

 4 RESULTS 4.1 Apixaban Apixaban plasma concentrations were significantly increased by coadministration of voriconazole, rifampicin and cobicistat (Figure  2 ). C max  showed significant increases for rifampicin (C max  ratio 1.69; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17–2.45) and cobicistat (C max  ratio 1.60; 95% CI: 1.29–1.99), but not for voriconazole (C max  ratio 1.15; 95% CI: 0.94–1.41; Table  1 ; Figure  2 ). Apixaban AUC increased significantly for each perpetrator with AUCRs significantly different from 1 for voriconazole (1.33; 95% CI: 1.01–1.75), rifampicin (1.33; 95% CI: 1.06–1.68) and cobicistat (1.67; 95% CI: 1.33–2.09). The terminal elimination half‐life was unchanged except for rifampicin where an almost 40% shortening was observed (8.37  vs  5.16 h). Apixaban Cl/F was consequently reduced to 75% by voriconazole and rifampicin, and to 60% by cobicistat. The oral cobicistat and rifampicin reduced V ss /F to almost 50%. Apixaban renal clearance was reduced to 70% during cobicistat.

No significant change of any edoxaban pharmacokinetic parameter was observed during voriconazole (Table  2 ). C max  and AUC of edoxaban significantly increased during rifampicin and cobicistat (Table  2 ). Both rifampicin and cobicistat showed significant differences from 1 for edoxaban AUCR (1.90; 95% CI: 1.43–2.52/1.74; 95% CI: 1.37–2.21) and C max  ratio (2.76; 95% CI: 1.76–4.32/2.40; 95% CI: 1.45–4.00). Edoxaban terminal elimination half‐life was shorter for rifampicin (30%) and cobicistat (25%). Consequently, edoxaban apparent oral clearance was reduced to 53% by rifampicin and to 57% by cobicistat. Rifampicin reduced the oral V ss /F to 37% and cobicistat to 42%.

However, C max  of rivaroxaban significantly increased for cobicistat only (Table  3 ). Voriconazole resulted in 33% changes of AUC and apparent oral clearance (Table  3 ). Cobicistat showed significant differences from 1 for rivaroxaban AUCR (2.00; 95% CI: 1.57–2.55) and C max  ratio (1.39; 95% CI: 1.20–1.62). Rivaroxaban terminal elimination half‐life was shorter for rifampicin (31%), but prolonged by cobicistat (40%). The oral V ss /F was reduced by both rifampicin to 64% and cobicistat to 72%.

For the rifampicin part, no valid statement can be made due to the imbalanced sex distribution (1 male, 5 female). 4.5 CYP3A activity To assess the effect of the 3 perpetrators on CYP3A activity, midazolam was orally coadministered as an ineffective microgram dose. 
 17 
  All perpetrators significantly increased midazolam AUC 2–4  and accordingly decreased the calculated partial metabolic midazolam clearance (Table  4 ). Midazolam AUCR accounted for 8.16 during voriconazole, 1.30 during rifampicin, and 8.77 during cobicistat coadministration.

Five out of 6 participants reported in total 7 AEs during voriconazole treatment, mainly visual disturbances ( n  = 4). During cobicistat treatment 3 out of 6 participants showed a single AE ( n  = 3); none was observed during rifampicin. When the microdosed FXaI and midazolam cocktail was given alone, only in 3 out of 18 participants was an AE observed. INR and aPTT were not significantly different between screening visit and end of study visit. INR was significantly increased by the microdosed FXaI cocktail (3.9%) and by the cocktail and the 3 perpetrators (3.3%); aPTT was also significantly increased by the microdosed FXaI cocktail (3.1%); no significant alteration was observed for the cocktail or the 3 perpetrators (1.5%). 5 DISCUSSION This study successfully investigated the currently unknown impact of 3 different perpetrators on FXaI pharmacokinetics. Voriconazole, cobicistat and rifampicin (single dose) were chosen because the effect of these paradigm perpetrators is of value for many anticoagulated patients requiring long‐term anti‐infective therapy. The use of a FXaI microdose cocktail (total dose of 100 μg) allows the investigation of drug–drug interaction within the same drug class without generating pharmacologicals effects and reduces the risk for AE to the study participants. This approach might be a future direction to expand knowledge on drug–drug interaction with FXaI by reducing the number of drug–drug interaction trials but not the number of perpetrators. The approach to use low substrate concentrations and therapeutic perpetrator concentrations elicits the same degree of perpetrator effects in comparison to therapeutic substrate concentrations.

  If the perpetrator dose is lowered, this results in dose and concentration dependent inhibition as shown for  ritonavir . 
 24 
 
 5.1 Apixaban Given orally, approximately 15% of apixaban is metabolised via CYP3A and about 6% by  CYP1A2  and CYP2J2. 
 6 
 ,  
 7 
  The remainder (≥50%) is excreted unchanged into faeces and urine or has not been identified or recovered so far (about 22%). 
 6 
  Voriconazole decreased apixaban Cl/F by 25% most probably due to its potent inhibition of CYP3A. The AUCR of the coadministered CYP3A marker midazolam increased significantly, proving that the activity of CYP3A was attenuated by voriconazole. It is currently unknown whether CYP2J2 or CYP1A2 are also inhibited by voriconazole. However, taking into account that voriconazole markedly decreased apixaban Cl/F it might be possible that voriconazole also inhibited CYP2J2 and CYP1A2. In contrast to voriconazole, a single dose of rifampicin also reduced apixaban clearance by 25% but affected apixaban C max  stronger than voriconazole (69%  vs  15%). These data suggest that rifampicin primarily affected the absorption (and/or distribution) of apixaban, which might be caused by an inhibition of intestinal P‐gp 
 25 
  (and hepatic OATP1B1 and 1B3 
 26 
 ), a transporter relevant during apixaban absorption. Interestingly, rifampicin significantly reduced apixaban t 1/2  but to a less pronounced extent as it has been observed with other substrates of P‐gp, such as doravirine whose elimination half‐life of 18.6 hours was reduced by a single dose of rifampicin to 5.5 hours. 
 27 
  An emerging early enzyme induction by rifampicin, which has been observed 12 hours after dosing of a single intravenous dose of rifampicin with  warfarin , might have caused the small impact on apixaban t 1/2. 
 
 28 
  The interaction observed after a single oral dose of rifampicin does not predict the interaction when rifampicin is administered repeatedly since the time‐dependent CYP inducing effect will add to the transporter inhibiting effect. Recently, a modelling and simulation approach has been conducted for rifampicin to predict successfully the complex drug–drug interaction with  glibenclamide . 
 29 
  Cobicistat, as the third perpetrator used, demonstrated the largest effects on apixaban pharmacokinetics with a 67% increase of AUC and a clearance reduction by 40%. Cobicistat acts as a strong CYP3A 
 30 
  and in addition as P‐gp and BCRP inhibitor. 
 31 
  The inhibition of drug transporters by cobicistat might be an important mechanism for the increased AUC and C max  of apixaban. In combination with the CYP3A inhibition (Table  4 ), it can be anticipated that cobicistat increased apixaban absorption and reduced its first‐pass metabolism. 5.2 Edoxaban The overall clearance mechanisms of an oral dose of edoxaban are very similar to those for apixaban. About 24% of an oral dose of edoxaban is excreted unchanged into urine and almost 50% of the dose can be found in faeces as parent drug. 
 9 
  However, cytochrome‐mediated metabolism is less relevant for edoxaban clearance. 
 9 
  Consequently, the CYP3A inhibitor voriconazole did not significantly alter edoxaban pharmacokinetics. In contrast, a single oral dose of rifampicin resulted in a pronounced increase of edoxaban C max  (2.76‐fold), which can probably be attributed to P‐gp inhibition. P‐gp in the gut wall probably contributes to the low oral bioavailability of edoxaban (~50%) 
 8 
  and high intestinal concentrations of rifampicin will most probably inhibit P‐gp, thereby increasing edoxaban absorption and, thus, C max . This is supported by an increased fraction of edoxaban excreted unchanged into urine (+48.7%) with unchanged renal clearance. P‐gp actively secretes edoxaban into urine. 
 9 
  The intestinal concentration of rifampicin is assumed to be much higher than that in plasma following oral administration. Hence, inhibition of P‐gp in the kidney will not be as prominent as in the intestine. Therefore, the intestine can be considered to be a primary tissue for the P‐gp‐mediated drug interaction for edoxaban. Almost equal results have been observed with cobicistat (P‐gp and CYP3A inhibitor). Cobicistat did not alter renal clearance of edoxaban but increased C max  by almost the same magnitude as observed with rifampicin. The increased absorbed fraction of edoxaban again resulted in an increased renal excretion of unchanged edoxaban, which emphasises that drugs mainly affect edoxaban pharmacokinetics by altering the activity of intestinal drug transporters. CYP3A inhibition does not seem to be relevant for drug interactions with edoxaban as indicated by the absence of significant changes of edoxaban pharmacokinetics by voriconazole. 5.3 Rivaroxaban In addition to unspecific hydrolysis, rivaroxaban is metabolised via CYP3A and CYP2J2. 
 5 
  Each of these pathways contributes between 14 and 18% of rivaroxaban's overall clearance. Voriconazole reduced rivaroxaban clearance by 33%, which suggests that voriconazole inhibited both CYP3A and CYP2J2. It seems obvious that voriconazole inhibits CYP2J2, since CYP3A and CYP2J2 are responsible for ~32% of the total rivaroxaban clearance 
 5 
  and a 33% clearance reduction by voriconazole was observed (assuming complete rivaroxaban bioavailability), but there is no proof of this assumption. Rivaroxaban amount excreted unchanged in urine and renal clearance were not altered by voriconazole. In contrast, a single oral dose of rifampicin inhibiting drug transporters did not significantly change rivaroxaban exposure and clearance. Renal clearance was also unaffected which is not consistent with the known P‐gp and BCRP mediated active renal secretion of rivaroxaban. 
 5 
 ,  
 12 
 ,  
 32 
  After 5 days of 400 mg ketoconazole or 5 days of 600 mg ritonavir twice daily, a strong inhibition of renal drug transporters was observed with significantly reduced renal clearances of rivaroxaban. 
 5 
  Systemic steady‐state concentrations of both P‐gp and BCRP inhibitors resulted in a diminished renal secretion of rivaroxaban. Rifampicin was not able to demonstrate a similar effect, which might be due to the single dose administration to inhibit mainly intestinal drug transporters and its short half‐life of 3 hours. 
 33 
  Therefore, the systemic concentration of rifampicin might not be high enough for the 48 hours observation period. Interestingly, the steady‐state volume of distribution was reduced by the single rifampicin dose resulting in a shorter rivaroxaban terminal elimination half‐life. Rivaroxaban distributes from the vessels into peripheral tissues, 
 34 
  which might be impaired by rifampicin altering uptake transporters. A similar observation has been reported for  atorvastatin , where it was suggested that the uptake of atorvastatin was decreased by rifampicin. 
 35 
  Repeated administration of rifampicin will result in CYP induction, which then might cause a similar reduction in rivaroxaban exposure, like for St. John's wort where an almost 50% reduced AUC was observed. 
 36 
  Finally, cobicistat significantly affected all pharmacokinetic parameter of rivaroxaban except the amount excreted unchanged into urine. Cobicistat appears to affect rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics via inhibition of CYP3A and CYP2J2 (similar to voriconazole) and via inhibition of P‐gp and BCRP (similar to rifampicin). In addition, the renal rivaroxaban clearance was reduced by almost 50%, which resembles the data obtained with ketoconazole and ritonavir. 
 5 
 
 5.4 CYP3A activity Microdosed midazolam was used to monitor CYP3A activity during the different perpetrators used in this study. As expected, both voriconazole and cobicistat acted as strong CYP3A inhibitors and caused AUCR &gt;5. Interestingly, the single oral dose of rifampicin also had a marginal inhibitory effect on midazolam exposure (30% increase). Rifampicin is known to induce its own elimination pathways after several days and thus reduce its terminal half‐life by 50%. 
 33 
  However, it is not known which enzymes contribute to rifampicin clearance pathways. If CYP3A metabolises rifampicin to a certain extent, there is a possibility that rifampicin might also act as CYP3A inhibitor, especially when sensitive victim drug such as midazolam are investigated. However, only a weak inhibition was observed. 5.5 Limitations A limitation of this exploratory study is that the effect of each perpetrator on FXaI pharmacokinetics was investigated in a low number of participants ( n  = 6). However, with the cross‐over design this was already sufficient to obtain valid results, which are statistically secured. To avoid enzyme induction by rifampicin, a single dose of rifampicin was administered, assuming that rifampicin inhibits drug transporters within the first hours after administration. However, changes in FXaI AUC ∞  suggested that rifampicin already induced enzyme transcription during the 2‐day observation period of this study and thus the effect of drug transporters on FXaI pharmacokinetics might be underestimated. 6 CONCLUSION In conclusion, a microdosed FXaI cocktail containing 25 μg apixaban, 25 μg rivaroxaban and 50 μg edoxaban was successfully applied to generate valid drug interaction data with voriconazole, cobicistat and a single oral dose of rifampicin on a single occasion for all 3 FXaI drugs. At least for cobicistat containing treatments a dose reduction by 30–50% should be considered for each of the 3 FXaI since AUCR ranged between 1.67 and 2.0. For future studies this approach of several perpetrators in 1 study might even be used with a smaller number of participants (e.g. 3 per perpetrator) to test for multiple perpetrators (e.g. 8 perpetrators in 24 participants).

    <Body>What is Already Known about this Subject 
 Filgotinib is an oral, small‐molecule, selective Janus kinase 1 inhibitor that combines early response and sustained efficacy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. Filgotinib pharmacokinetics (PK) have previously been characterized in healthy subjects and in patients, demonstrating extensive and rapid absorption and dose‐proportional PK over a 50–200 mg once‐daily dose range. 
 What this Study Adds 
 The study found supporting data to indicate that age and mild to moderate impairment of renal function had a limited impact on the PK of filgotinib and its major metabolite. 
 Introduction Filgotinib is an oral, small‐molecule, selective Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) inhibitor combining early response and sustained clinical efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA)  1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4  and Crohn's disease (CD)  5 ,  6 . Selectively inhibiting JAK1 may modulate a subset of proinflammatory cytokines within the JAK–signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, which may improve the benefit–risk profile compared with other pan‐JAK inhibitors  7 . Filgotinib is a selective JAK1 inhibitor with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) value of 629 nM (267 ng ml –1 ); in human whole blood, the compound was 30 times more selective for JAK1 over JAK2  8 ,  9 . Filgotinib has a major metabolite with a similar JAK1 selectivity profile but with reduced potency (19‐fold) in a human whole‐blood assay  8 . In humans, exposure to this metabolite is higher by approximately 16‐ to 20‐fold compared with the parent filgotinib  10 . Filgotinib is extensively and rapidly absorbed after oral dosing, and is metabolized by carboxylesterase isoform 2 (CES2), forming its main metabolite  11 . Systemic exposures of filgotinib and its main metabolite increased dose proportionally over a 50–200 mg once‐daily dose (QD) range. Filgotinib and its metabolites are predominantly eliminated in urine (&gt;80%). RA is a chronic, progressive, systemic inflammatory disease. Lifelong disease‐modifying therapy may be required in RA, extending treatment into older patient groups. Hence, characterization of the potential effect of age on filgotinib pharmacokinetics (PK) is important to inform whether dose adjustments may be necessary in the elderly. Various physiological changes that can have an impact on drug disposition are associated with ageing  12 , such as reduced muscle mass and total body water, and increased body fat  13 . In addition, a reduction in the apparent liver blood flow with age by about 40% is also expected to affect phase I metabolism rather than phase II conjugation. Although the metabolism of filgotinib is not mediated by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) at the hepatic level, but rather by CES2 at the intestinal level, there is limited information available on the potential impact of ageing on these enzymes. Finally, the most significant organ changes in the elderly occur in the kidneys, with a decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from 0.40 ml min –1  1.73 m –2  to 1.02 ml min –1  1.73 m –2  per year. The current study sought to characterize the effect of ageing and renal impairment (RI) on the PK of filgotinib and its major metabolite, to gain information on optimal dosing and to maximize its benefit : risk profile. Although the PK of filgotinib are linear (i.e. dose proportional and time independent) within the therapeutic dose range (50–200 mg), the investigations were performed after repeated dosing (100 mg QD), to assess any potential change induced by age and/or decrease in kidney function on the steady‐state PK of filgotinib and its main metabolite. Methods Two studies were conducted in accordance with the accepted standards for the protection of patient safety and welfare, and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments, and followed Good Clinical Practice. Protocols and informed consent forms for the ageing study and the RI study were approved by the Ziekenhuis Netwerk Antwerpen Ethics Committee (Belgium) and by Ärztekammer Schleswig‐Holstein Independent Ethics Committee (Germany), respectively. All subjects gave written informed consent prior to study initiation. Trial designs Effect of age (NCT2012–002721‐30) The effect of age was evaluated in an open‐label phase I study conducted in two groups of 10 healthy elderly subjects (65–74 and ≥ 75 years of age) and one control group of 10 younger subjects (40–50 years of age). Eligible subjects were in good health, with a body mass index (BMI) of 18–30 kg m –2  and no clinically significant deviation from normal, in terms of medical history, physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and clinical laboratory determinations. Subjects were excluded from the study if they had history of or a current immunosuppressive condition or the presence or sequelae of gastrointestinal, liver or kidney, or other conditions known to interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs. Subjects had to discontinue all medications (including over‐the‐counter medications and herbal supplements) within the 2 weeks prior to first dosing. The two groups of elderly subjects have been arbitrarily defined to cover subjects aged from 65 years and also in the older age range, 75 years and above. All subjects (male and female) were matched for body weight across each age group. After a standard breakfast, filgotinib 100 mg (capsule formulation) was administered QD for 10 days. Blood samples were collected for filgotinib and its metabolite on day 10 at the following times: predose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h postdose. Additional predose samples were collected on days 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 for steady‐state assessment. Urine was collected in three fractions on day 10 (0–6, 6–12, 12–24 h after dosing). Additionally, urine samples were collected on day 1 over 24 h to calculate the creatinine clearance (CL CR ) and estimate the potential decline in renal function in elderly subjects. Effect of RI (NCT2013–004407‐40) The effect of RI was evaluated in an open‐label phase I study conducted in healthy male and female subjects between 18–79 years of age, with a BMI of 18–34 kg m –2  and with various degrees of RI, categorized according to the eGFR using the modification of diet in renal disease equation. As filgotinib is predominantly eliminated via metabolism, the effect of RI was firstly assessed in three subjects with an eGFR between 15 and 29 (inclusive) ml min –1  1.73 m –2  as a ʻworst caseʼ scenario to determine the magnitude of the change in PK in these subjects with severe RI. The PK and safety data from these three subjects were compared with those of three subjects with normal renal function. Given the substantial changes noted for the metabolite (more than twofold increase in exposure)  14 , the study was expanded to investigate further the changes in PK in subjects with moderate (eGFR: 30–59 ml min –1  1.73 m –2 ) and mild (eGFR: 60–89 ml min –1  1.73 m –2 ) RI in comparison with PK from subjects with normal renal function. For this second step, six subjects were enrolled for each renal function group. For the final PK analysis, data from subjects with normal renal function included in the two study steps were pooled ( n  = 9). Subjects with normal renal function were matched to the RI subjects, in terms of median age (±10 years) and BMI (±15%). Eligible subjects were in good health and in stable condition with regard to renal function, based on the results of medical history, physical examinations, vital signs, 12‐lead ECG and clinical laboratory determinations. Subjects were excluded from the study if they had a history of or a current immunosuppressive condition or a history of gastric surgery, vagotomy and bowel resection, or any surgical procedures known to interfere with the gastrointestinal motility, pH or absorption. Additionally, to control for potential influences derived from the natural course of the renal dysfunction and demonstrate the stability of the RI, the variation in serum creatinine level was measured 3–6 months prior to screening and at the time of screening; this variation should be &lt;20%. Subjects with normal renal function had to discontinue all concomitant medications (including over‐the‐counter medications and herbal supplements) within the 2 weeks prior to first dosing. The same restrictions applied for RI subjects, with the exception of medications essential for the treatment of concomitant medical conditions and the management of RI. After a 10‐h fast, filgotinib 100 mg (tablet formulation) was administered QD for 10 days. Food had no impact on the bioavailability of filgotinib  10 ; however, to prevent any issues at dosing intake in these subjects, the tablet was given in a fasted state. Blood samples were collected to evaluate the PK of filgotinib and its metabolite on day 10 at the following times: predose and at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 168 h after dosing. Trough plasma concentrations were determined at days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 8 for steady‐state assessment. Urine was collected in three fractions on day 10 (0–6, 6–12 and 12–24 h after dosing). Blood and urine sample management Blood was collected in tubes containing lithium heparin to obtain plasma for the analysis of concentrations of filgotinib and its major metabolite. Within 30 min after blood collection, the plasma was separated in a refrigerated centrifuge (4–8°C) for 10 min at approximately 1500  g  and stored at −20°C until analysis. Urine samples were collected and refrigerated (2–8°C) until sample collection was completed. After measuring the total weight, the urine was homogenized and 10 ml aliquots were placed into prelabelled polypropylene containers and stored at −20°C until analysis. Bioanalytical and PK assessments Plasma and urine concentrations of filgotinib and its major metabolite were determined using a validated liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) assay  10 . The internal standard (deuterated filgotinib) was added to plasma samples and then processed by solid phase extraction. The evaporated and reconstituted samples were injected into a SCIEX API3000 LC–MS/MS equipped with a short high‐pressure LC column. Filgotinib and its metabolite were detected with multiple reaction monitoring. Quantification was performed using peak area ratios and standard curves (with 1/x 2  least squares quadratic regression) prepared from calibration standards. The lower limit of quantification for filgotinib and its metabolite was 1.00 ng ml –1 . For both compounds, the between‐ and within‐run precision for quality controls was expressed as the coefficient of variation (CV%) and was no greater than 8.7% and 8.5%, respectively, with deviations from nominal concentrations of no more than 12.0%. For urine samples, the between‐ and within‐run precision for quality controls for filgotinib and its metabolite was expressed as CV% and was no greater than 11.0% and 12.9%, respectively, with deviations from nominal concentrations of no more than 14.0%. The steady‐state PK parameters for filgotinib and its metabolite included: maximum plasma concentration (C max ), the time of occurrence of C max  (t max ), the apparent terminal half‐life (t ½,λz ), the area under the curve over the dosing interval (AUC 0–24 h ), the metabolite‐to‐parent ratio (R) evaluated using AUC 0–24 h , the amount excreted in the urine (Ae) and the renal clearance (CL R ) calculated over the dosing interval. These PK parameters were determined using WinNonLin® (version 5.3), Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA, USA. Safety assessments General safety was evaluated by the incidence of adverse events through nonleading questioning, vital signs, 12‐lead ECGs, physical examinations and clinical laboratory parameters (haematology, biochemistry and urinalysis). Statistical analyses No formal sample size calculations were performed for either study. The number of subjects per group was considered sufficient to allow for relevant comparisons of PK and safety data among subjects with various degrees of RI or of different ages. Descriptive statistics for the PK parameters were calculated. For each group of elderly or RI subjects, the fold‐change in exposure (C max  and AUC 0–24 h )  vs . control subjects (i.e. young or normal renal function groups) was calculated as the point estimate with its associated 90% confidence interval (CI) of the least‐square geometric means of the mixed‐effect analysis of variance, with age group or stage of RI as fixed factor, and represented graphically. Additionally, the relationship between PK parameters and renal function (CL CR  or eGFR) was explored in both studies. The impact of age and RI on the PK of filgotinib and its metabolite was assessed, taking into account both the magnitude of the change and the statistical analysis. A fold‐change in mean PK parameters for filgotinib or its metabolite ≤2 was considered as moderate and of no clinical relevance. In addition, for all 90% CIs that contained the value of one, the observed fold‐change was considered as not statistically significant. Results Subject disposition and baseline characteristics Subject disposition is presented in Table  1 . Most of the subjects included in the two studies (96.7% and 100%, respectively) were Caucasian. In the study to assess the effect of age, males were predominant in the two elderly groups (70–80%), and females (80%) in the younger control group. In the RI study, most of subjects were male in each subgroup (66.7–100%). The other demographic and baseline characteristics across subgroups, except for age and renal function, were comparable.

Overall, there were no or minimal differences between age groups for all PK parameters, as shown by the 90% CI containing the value of one, except for exposure (AUC 0–24 h ), with a maximal increase of 1.40‐fold observed in the oldest  vs . youngest age group. The percentage of filgotinib excreted in the urine was not affected by age, with mean values of 6.55% and 7.24% of the daily dose administered for the two elderly age groups, respectively, compared with 8.01% for the younger control group. As a consequence, CL R  was 34% lower in the oldest compared with the youngest age group. Figure 3 Fold‐change (90% CI) in steady‐state C max  and AUC 0–24 h  of filgotinib (A) and its metabolite (B) in elderly subjects (65–74 and ≥75 years) relative to young subjects (40–50 years).

The decrease in filgotinib CL R  was poorly associated with a decrease in CL CR  (Figure  4 ). Figure 4 Relationship between the steady‐state renal clearance (CL R ) of filgotinib (A) and its metabolite (B), and creatinine clearance (CL CR ) The main metabolite was formed rapidly, with a median t max  ranging between 3.0 h and 5.0 h, and was slowly eliminated according to a mono‐exponential decline (Figure  1 ). Steady state was attained within 4 dosing days (Figure  2 ), consistent with the t ½,λz  of approximately 22 h. An overall increase of 1.25‐fold in C max  and of 1.33‐fold in AUC 0–24 h  was noted in the oldest  vs . youngest age groups (Figure  3 ). Additionally, the percentage of filgotinib metabolite excreted unchanged in the urine was not affected by age: 34.3% and 37.6% of the daily dose administered for the youngest group (40–50 years) and oldest group (≥75 years), respectively. Consequently, CL R  was 40% lower in the oldest (CL R  = 0.926 l h –1 ) compared with the youngest (CL R  = 1.25 l h –1 ) age group. In regard to filgotinib, the decrease in metabolite CL R  was not associated with a decrease in CL CR  (Figure  4 ). The apparent elimination half‐life (t ½ ) of filgotinib (mean range: 5.83–6.90 h) was not altered by age. For the metabolite, the apparent elimination t ½,λz  was similar for the two elderly groups (24.7 h and 23.5 h, respectively) but slightly longer than for the youngest (17.8 h). PK differences between age groups were similar between filgotinib and its metabolite, as reflected by similar R values across the three age groups. In all age groups, the between‐subject variability was low to moderate, as reflected by CV%s of C max  and AUC 0–24 h  lower than 40% for both filgotinib and its metabolite. Effect of RI A summary of PK parameters for filgotinib and of its major metabolite at day 10 of dosing is shown in Table  3 . Filgotinib was rapidly absorbed, with C max  reached 1 h after dosing on day 10 (Figure  5 ). Sequential predose (trough) concentrations are shown in Figure  6 , demonstrating that steady state for filgotinib concentrations in the plasma was reached by day 2 in all renal function groups. No accumulation was observed, which was consistent with the short t ½,λz  (5.42–10.9 h) and the QD dosing interval. In all groups, the between‐subject variability, as reflected by the CV%s of AUC 0–24 h  and C max , was moderate to high after multiple dosing (CV%s up to 60%).

RI, renal impairment RI reduced the Ae over 24 h (Ae 0–24 h ), which decreased with the degree of RI. Consequently, the CL R  decreased with the degree of RI, leading to 1.54‐ and 1.42‐fold higher filgotinib plasma exposure (AUC 0–24 h ) in subjects with severe and moderate RI, respectively, compared with subjects with normal renal function (C max  did not appear to differ according to stage of RI). However, the 90% CI of the fold‐change  vs . control group included the value of one and suggested that these changes observed in the AUC 0–24 h  of filgotinib for moderate and severe RI were not significant (Figure  7 ).

AUC 0–24 h , area under the curve over the dosing interval; CI, confidence interval; C max , maximum plasma concentration; PE point estimate For the metabolite, steady‐state plasma concentrations were reached between day 3 (normal renal function and mild RI) and day 5 (moderate and severe RI), consistent with mean t ½,λz  values ranging from 20.8 h (normal renal function) to 43.6 h (severe RI), as shown in Figure  6 . A graphical representation of the fold‐change differences in C max  and AUC 0–24 h  between RI groups relative to the group with normal renal function is presented in Figure  7 . RI showed a marked effect on the metabolite exposure (C max , AUC 0–24 h ), as well as its elimination parameters (t ½,λz  and CL R ). In the severe RI group, the reduction in its elimination (mean CL R  values 0.488  vs . 1.59 l h –1  and mean t ½  values 43.6  vs . 20.8 h) resulted in 2.17‐ and 2.74‐fold higher C max  and AUC 0–24 h , respectively, compared with subjects with normal renal function. In the two other RI groups, no or a minimal effect was noted  vs . the control group, except for moderate RI, with a 1.67‐fold increase in AUC 0–24 h . In all groups, the between‐subject variability reflected by the CV%s of AUC 0–24 h  and C max  was low to moderate after multiple dosing (up to 38.4%). The relationships between exposure to filgotinib and its metabolite (AUC 0–24 h  and C max ) and eGFR are illustrated in Figure  8 . The correlation coefficient was higher for the metabolite than the parent drug, filgotinib.

AUC 0–24 h  = area under the curve over the dosing interval, C max , maximum plasma concentration; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; RI, renal impairment Safety There were no deaths or serious adverse events during either study. In the current studies, none of the treatment‐emergent adverse events were severe in intensity and none led to study medication withdrawal, although three of them were of moderate severity: migraine (age study), urinary continence (age study) and headache (RI study). There were no clinically significant changes in laboratory values, physical examination, vital signs, or ECG parameters. Filgotinib 100 mg QD for 10 days was generally safe and well tolerated in these studies. Discussion Two phase I open‐label studies were conducted to examine the effects of age and RI on the steady‐state PK of filgotinib and its major metabolite. Although most of the subjects included in these two studies were Caucasian (&gt;96%) and males were predominant in the two elderly groups (70–80%) and in each RI group (66.7–100%), this was not expected to confound the potential effect of age or renal function on filgotinib PK, as none of the demographic factors (e.g. sex, body weight, BMI, race) were shown significantly to affect filgotinib PK, based on population PK analysis using phase II data in RA and CD  15 ,  16 ,  17 . Although these two studies used different filgotinib formulations and administration conditions (the effect of age study used a capsule formulation in fed conditions and the RI study used a tablet formulation in the fasted state), filgotinib and metabolite exposure appeared to be comparable for the control groups across these two studies. No change in PK was noted in the 65–74‐year age group. Filgotinib exposure (AUC 0–24 h ) was moderately higher, by 1.40‐fold, in subjects aged ≥75 years, while C max,  t ½,λz  and Ae for unchanged filgotinib were not altered. The CL R  decreased with age, as did the CL CR , but without a strong relationship between these parameters. Of note, even though CL CR  was lower in elderly subjects, the values were still within the normal range, indicating that there was no RI in these subjects. Higher gastric pH may have been a factor for differences in bioavailability in elderly subjects  18 ,  19 ; however, for filgotinib administered as the hydrochlorhydrate salt in these two studies, a higher gastric pH would have led to filgotinib free base formation, which is less soluble and bioavailable than the ionized form. Consequently, higher gastric pH would be unlikely to account for the observed increase in exposure in the elderly subjects aged ≥75 years. Similarly to filgotinib, exposure to the metabolite was higher (by 1.33‐fold) in the oldest subjects after filgotinib 100 mg QD, with no change in the formation and elimination of the metabolite. This observation was supported by the constant R values over the entire age range (from 18.4 to 19.4). Based on these data, it could be concluded that age had no impact on the carboxylesterases involved in filgotinib's metabolite formation. Overall, the moderate change (&lt;2‐fold) observed in exposure of filgotinib and its metabolite are unlikely to be linked to physiological changes associated with age and could be due to variability and the small sample size ( n  = 10 per age group). This is further support by the population PK model developed with data obtained in patients with RA  15  and CD  16 ,  17 , in which age was not included as a significant covariate in the PK modelling of filgotinib and its metabolite. In the RI study, filgotinib CL R  decreased with the degree of RI, with an 80% lower value for subjects with severe RI (0.898 l h –1 ), compared with subjects with normal renal function (4.45 l h –1 ). The decrease in CL R  in severe RI subjects resulted in a moderate increase in filgotinib systemic exposure (by 1.54‐fold  vs . normal). For the metabolite, C max , and AUC 0–24 h  increased with the degree of RI severity. At the extremes of renal function (i.e. severe RI compared with normal renal function), the mean values of C max  and AUC 0–24 h  increased by 2.17‐fold and 2.74‐fold, respectively. In the two other RI groups, no or a minimal effect was noted  vs . the control group, except for moderate RI with a 1.67‐fold increase in AUC 0–24 h . The t ½,λz  of the filgotinib metabolite was also longer according to RI severity: 20.8 h and 25.4 h for subjects with normal renal function or mild RI, and 31.7 h and 43.6 h for subjects with moderate and severe RI, respectively. The CL R  decreased with the degree of RI, with a 51% and 69% drop in the moderate and severe renal RI groups (0.781 l h –1  and 0.488 l h –1 ), respectively, compared with subjects with normal renal function (1.59 l h –1 ) or mild RI (1.21 l h –1 ). Although the number of subjects included in each RI group was small ( n  = 3–6), the results of the present study showed a clear trend of increased exposure associated with decreased renal function. The observed differences in exposure to the metabolite were more pronounced compared with the parent drug, which was consistent with the fact that, in humans, filgotinib is mainly metabolized, with only a small fraction (&lt;10%) excreted unchanged in the urine, whereas its metabolite is excreted mainly in the urine (≥50%). In terms of the impact of age and RI, a two‐fold increase in mean exposure was defined as a substantial effect and used as the threshold for interpretation. Based on this criterion, a significant change &gt;2‐fold was observed for the metabolite exposure in severe RI only. Clinical efficacy was observed at daily doses of 75–300 mg in a phase IIa study in patients with RA with an insufficient response to methotrexate and naïve to biological disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs, with similar effects noted for these doses in terms of improvements in C‐reactive protein and disease activity scores based on 28 joints  1 ,  2 ,  20 . Subsequently, efficacy was confirmed in larger, phase IIb studies of filgotinib given as monotherapy  3  and in combination with methotrexate  4 . Filgotinib dosed at 100–200 mg once daily is currently being evaluated in pivotal phase III studies in patients across several indications, including RA, CD and ulcerative colitis. Conclusions Age and mild to moderate RI had a limited impact on the PK of filgotinib. In subjects with severe RI, the exposure to filgotinib's metabolite was elevated, consistent with its renal elimination pathway. Competing Interests F.N. is an employee of Galapagos SASU.

    <Body>What is already known about this subject 
 EA‐230 is a β‐hCG‐derived immunomodulatory tetrapeptide, developed for the treatment of systemic inflammation‐related disorders. EA‐230 was shown to reduce organ dysfunction and mortality in various animal studies of systemic inflammation. Phase I studies showed an excellent safety profile of EA‐230 and pharmacokinetics analysis revealed a very short half‐life and a large volume of distribution. 
 What this study adds 
 No safety issues emerged in this phase IIa study in 36 volunteers. EA‐230 attenuates the systemic inflammatory response in humans  in vivo . Results of this study provide the basis for a patient study with EA‐230. 
 1 INTRODUCTION Systemic inflammation can arise due to a variety of infectious as well as non‐infectious conditions such as sepsis, trauma and major surgical interventions. 1 ,  2  Although the immune response is essential for clearance of pathogens and initiation of tissue repair, a too persistent or overzealous response is detrimental and can lead to pronounced tissue damage with associated organ failure and mortality rates up to 30%. 3 ,  4  This is for instance exemplified by the high incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in systemic inflammation‐related conditions, occurring in over a half of critically ill patients and in up to 30% of patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. 5 ,  6 ,  7 ,  8 
 Despite its tremendous impact, no immunomodulatory interventions have proven to be effective in regulating the systemic inflammatory response to prevent organ injury. 9 ,  10 ,  11  Current strategies are confined to supportive treatment and novel strategies aimed at attenuating this exaggerated inflammatory response to prevent organ failure are therefore highly warranted. EA‐230 is a synthetic linear tetrapeptide (alanine–glutamine–glycine–valine; AQGV) derived from the β‐chain of the human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (β‐HCG). The discovery of this peptide finds its roots in the unique immunological situation encountered during pregnancy, in which the maternal immune system is adapted to tolerate the semi‐allogeneic fetus without compromising pathogen clearing capacity. 12 ,  13  A striking hallmark of this immune‐tolerant phenotype is attenuated disease activity of various autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and psoriasis during pregnancy and their relapse after delivery. 14 ,  15 ,  16 ,  17  HCG was shown to play a central role in this immune‐tolerant adaption of the maternal immune system, 18 ,  19 ,  20 ,  21  which has led to the discovery of immune active fragments of the β‐chain. These oligopeptides were found to circulate abundantly throughout pregnancy and to exert beneficial effects in various animals models of systemic inflammation, including attenuation of the inflammatory response, less organ failure and improved survival. 22 ,  23 ,  24 ,  25 ,  26 ,  27 ,  28 ,  29 ,  30 ,  31  Of these peptides, the linear tetrapeptide AQGV (later named EA‐230) strongly attenuated inflammation, preserved kidney function, and substantially reduced mortality in models of renal ischaemia–reperfusion, 24  kidney transplantation, 25  and haemorrhagic‐ 28  and endotoxaemia‐induced shock. 26 
 Following these encouraging preclinical results, we performed phase I studies with different dosing regimens that showed EA‐230 to be well‐tolerated with an excellent safety profile (reported elsewhere in this issue 32 ). The present phase IIa study follows‐up on our earlier results. In a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study, we investigated the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of EA‐230 during experimental human endotoxaemia, a standardized controlled model of systemic inflammation induced by intravenous administration of  Escherichia coli ‐derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to healthy volunteers. 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Subjects, ethics and study design Following written informed consent, 36 healthy adult males were enrolled in this single‐centre, double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled phase IIa study. The study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee (CMO Arnhem‐Nijmegen, NL56102.091.15; 2015–2231) and was prospectively registered at  clinicaltrial.gov  (NCT02629874). All study procedures complied with the Declaration of Helsinki, including current revisions, and Good Clinical Practice standards. Quality assurance, full data validation and monitoring of all source documents and study procedures were performed by a contract research organization (QPS, Groningen, the Netherlands). Health status of the participants was determined by medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG) and routine laboratory blood tests. Exclusion criteria included body mass index &lt;18 or &gt;30 kg/m 2 , clinically significant illness within 2 weeks before the start of the study, known hypersensitivity to any excipients of the drug formulations used, history of spontaneous vagal collapse, significant blood loss within 90 days prior to the study, participation in any other clinical trial within 1 month prior to the study and participation in a previous trial in which LPS was administered. Prior to and during every study procedure, subjects were not allowed to use any medication, recreational drugs, nicotine, caffeine and/or alcohol. Subjects were consecutively assigned to the 15, 45 or 90 mg/kg/h group, based on the order of their appearance on the study drug administration day. Dose regimens were based on the phase I studies using the same dosages without any safety concerns reported elsewhere in this issue. 32  Each dosage group consisted of 12 subjects; within each dosage group subjects were randomly assigned to receive either EA‐230 or placebo ( n  = 8 active study drug,  n  = 4 placebo) making use of a randomization list. All subjects underwent endotoxaemia in combination with EA‐230 or placebo, as further detailed below. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability, assessed by the incidence of treatment related (serious) adverse events ([S]AEs). Secondary endpoints included effects on the LPS‐induced inflammatory response and pharmacokinetics. 2.2 Study medication EA‐230 and placebo were supplied as solution for injection in identical 5 mL sterile single‐use vials. EA‐230 vials contained 300 mg/mL active substrate and placebo vials contained an osmolar equivalent of 29 mg/mL sodium chloride solution. Vials were manufactured by Halix BV (Leiden, Netherlands), quality controlled by PROXY Laboratories BV (Leiden, Netherlands), vials with EA‐230 were stored at 2–8°C and placebo vials at room temperature. Before administration, the required dosage of EA‐230 or placebo was diluted in 0.9% NaCl to a volume of 500 mL. Manufacturing, packaging, quality control and preparation were described in an Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier and complied with Good Manufacturing Practice requirements. 2.3 Study procedures and experimental human endotoxaemia A schematic overview of the study procedures is depicted in Figure  1 . Figure 1 Schematic overview of study procedures. Time points on the horizontal axes are in hours relative to LPS administration unless specified otherwise. ICU: intensive care unit; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; (S)AEs: (serious) adverse events; h: hours; d: days Study subjects were administered to a fully equipped research unit at the intensive care unit of the Radboud university medical centre. The nondominant arm was cannulated for intravenous (i.v.) fluid administration and a 20‐gauge arterial catheter was used for continuous blood pressure monitoring and blood sampling. As part of our standard endotoxaemia protocol, 33 ,  34 ,  35  subjects received a 1‐hour infusion of 1.5 L prehydration solution (2.5% glucose/4.5% NaCl) starting at  t  = −1 h. At  t  = 0 h, LPS was administered, the intravenous cannula was flushed with 0.9% NaCl, and study drug treatment was initiated. Purified LPS (US Standard Reference Endotoxin  Escherichia coli  O:113) obtained from the Pharmaceutical Development Section of the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD, USA) was administered as an i.v. bolus injection at a dose of 2 ng/kg body weight. Study drug treatment was administered as a 2‐hour continuous i.v. infusion at 250 mL/h. Fluid administration continued at  t  = 2 h, after cessation of study drug treatment, at 150 mL/h. During the day frequent blood samples were collected and adverse events, vital signs and endotoxaemia‐related symptoms were monitored until discharge at  t  = 8 h. Subjects returned at 24 hours, 48 hours, 7 days and 14 days after study drug administration for follow‐up. 2.4 Safety Safety and tolerability assessments were performed continuously from the start of study drug treatment until 8 hours afterwards and at 4 consecutive study visits during the 14‐day follow‐up period. Safety parameters included vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate), 12‐lead ECG and routine laboratory haematology and biochemistry. AEs were recorded throughout the complete study period. All AEs were judged by the investigator with regard to severity (mild, moderate or severe) according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events guidelines 4.0, 36  and their relation to the study drug (definitely related, probably related, possibly related, unlikely to be related or unrelated). LPS‐induced flu‐like symptoms were scored separately, as explained below, and for practical considerations excluded from safety analyses. SAEs included death, life‐threatening, persistent and/or significant disability and/or incapacity and hospitalization and/or prolongation of inpatient hospitalization. Safety parameters were reported to and reviewed by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) after completion of each dosing group. 2.5 Plasma inflammatory mediators Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)‐anticoagulated blood samples for measurement of inflammatory parameters were obtained at time points  t  = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 hours (Figure  1 ). Samples were immediately centrifuged at 2000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C after which plasma was stored at −80°C until analysis. Plasma levels of a core set of inflammatory mediators (interleukin [IL]‐6, IL‐10 and tumour necrosis factor [TNF]‐α), were determined using a validated, ISO9001 certified multiplex immunoassay technology (Luminex, Austin, TX, USA) at the Laboratory of Translational Immunology of the University Medical Center Utrecht as described elsewhere. 37 
 Plasma levels of IL‐8, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)‐1, IL‐1 receptor antagonist (RA), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)‐1α and MIP‐1β were determined using a Luminex assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Milliplex; Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Plasma levels of endothelial adhesion proteins intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)‐1 and vascular cell adhesion protein (VCAM)‐1 were also analysed using a Luminex assay (Bio‐plex; Bio‐Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. 2.6 Leucocyte counts and differentiation EDTA anticoagulated blood samples were obtained at time points  t  = −1, 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24 and 48 hours (Figure  1 ). Direct measurements of leucocyte counts and differentiations were performed using clinical routine analysis methods at the Laboratory of Clinical Chemistry of the Radboud university medical center (Sysmex XE‐5000, Sysmex Nederland B.V., Etten‐Leur, the Netherlands). 2.7 Vital signs and endotoxaemia‐induced symptoms Heart rate, measured with a 3‐lead ECG, and blood pressure were recorded every 30 seconds from a Philips MP50 patient monitor using an in‐house developed system. Every 30 minutes, temperature was measured using an infrared tympanic thermometer (First‐Temp Genius 2; Covidien, Dublin, Ireland), and LPS‐induced flu‐like symptoms (headache, nausea, shivering, muscle and back pain) were scored per symptom (0 = no symptoms, 5 = worst ever experienced, vomiting: additional 3 points), resulting in a total symptom score of 0–28. 2.8 Pharmacokinetics Blood samples for measurement of EA‐230 concentrations were obtained at time points  t  = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours (Figure  1 ). Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (300 μL, P8340; Sigma‐Aldrich Chemie, Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands) was added immediately after withdrawal of 3 mL EDTA‐anticoagulated blood to prevent proteolytic degradation of EA‐230. Hereafter, blood samples were centrifuged at 2000  g  for 15 minutes at 4°C and plasma samples were stored at −80°C until analysis. EA‐230 concentrations were determined by a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay as described elsewhere in this issue. 32  The detection range of the method was 0.5–100 ng/mL with low, medium and high quality control concentrations of 1.5, 10 and 75 ng/mL. Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed with non‐compartmental methods using WinNonLin/Phoenix version 6.3 (Pharsight Corporation, USA). The highest observed plasma concentration was defined as C max . The area under the plasma  vs  concentration time curve from  t  = 0 to the time of the last measured concentration (AUC 0‐last ) was calculated using the linear‐log trapezoidal rule, with extrapolation to infinity (using C last /β) to obtain the AUC from t = 0 to infinity (AUC 0‐inf ). The log‐linear period (log concentration  vs  time) was defined by visual inspection of data points. The absolute value of the slope (β/2.303) was calculated by least squares linear regression analysis, where β is the first‐order elimination rate constant. Elimination half‐life (t 1/2 ) was calculated by the equation 0.693/β. Clearance (Cl) was calculated by dividing dose by AUC 0‐inf  and volume of distribution (Vd) by dividing Cl by β. 2.9 Statistical analysis The study was regarded as exploratory in nature and sample size was based on practical considerations, exposing a limited number of subjects while obtaining the necessary safety and efficacy data. (S)AEs are summarized by treatment group, preferred term, severity and relation to the study drug. Efficacy data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean, demographic data as mean ± standard deviation. PK parameters are presented as geometric mean and 95% confidence interval. Data were tested for normality using the Shapiro–Wilk test and a maximum normalized residual test according to Grubb was performed on efficacy data to identify significant outliers with a  P &lt;  .01. Differences over time between EA‐230‐treated and placebo‐treated subjects were compared by repeated measures 2‐way ANOVA (interaction term: group*time). Baseline differences in demographic data were tested using a 1‐way ANOVA. Dose proportionality of dose  vs  AUC 0‐last , and C max  was assessed using 1‐way ANOVA followed by a Bonferroni posthoc test on dose‐normalized, log‐transformed data. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 5.03 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). A 2‐sided  P ‐value &lt;.05 was considered statistically significant. 3 RESULTS 3.1 Baseline characteristics and subject disposition All study subjects received study medication according to the protocol and there were no relevant baseline differences between groups (Table  1 ). One subject in the 90 mg/kg/h group was excluded from all efficacy analyses because of an unusually high cytokine response (significant outlier both within the 90 mg/kg/h group and in all groups combined for IL‐6 and TNF‐α [Grubb's test  P &lt;  .01]) in combination with gastrointestinal complaints that were assessed as unlikely to be related to the study drug or endotoxin administration.

 AE , adverse events; e, number of events;  n , number of subjects. No SAEs were reported and infusion of EA‐230 during experimental endotoxaemia was well‐tolerated by all subjects across dosage groups without any safety concerns and/or discontinuation of study drug administration. Accordingly, no concerns were raised by the DSMB after completion of each dosing group. Nineteen AEs were reported by 14 subjects, all of which were mild, transient and considered not, or unlikely to be, related to study drug treatment. Seven subjects (29%) treated with EA‐230 and seven placebo‐treated subjects (58%) reported ≥1 AE. Of all AEs, 9 were reported in the placebo group  vs  10 in EA‐230 treated subjects, 5 of which in the highest dosing group. Other than the expected LPS‐induced alterations in vital signs and leucocyte counts discussed below, alterations in laboratory parameters, vital signs and 12‐leads ECG were considered not clinically significant. 3.3 Effects of EA‐230 on circulating levels of inflammatory mediators and adhesion molecules during endotoxaemia The LPS‐induced increase in plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines IL‐6 and IL‐1RA was significantly attenuated in subjects treated with 90 mg/kg/h EA‐230 compared to the placebo group (% reduction in AUC of 48 and 33 respectively), but not of TNF‐α and IL‐10 (% increment in AUC of 1 and 33 respectively; Figure  2 ). The other dosages of EA‐230 had no effects on either of these cytokines, these data are depicted in Supplemental data file 1. Treatment with the highest dose of EA‐230 also significantly attenuated circulating levels of chemokines IL‐8, MCP‐1, MIP1‐α and MIP1‐β (% reduction in AUC of 28, 28, 14 and 16 respectively; Figure  3 ), and plasma concentrations of the endothelial adhesion molecule VCAM‐1, but not intercellular adhesion molecule‐1 (% reduction in AUC of 19 and 5 respectively; Figure  4 ). Again, the lower dosages of EA‐230 had no effects on any of these mediators (Supplemental data file 1). Figure 2 Plasma levels of cytokines during endotoxaemia.

P ‐values between groups were calculated using repeated measures 2‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA, interaction term) 3.4 Effects of EA‐230 on leucocyte counts and differentiation during endotoxaemia LPS administration typically caused initial leucopenia during the 1st hour followed by a profound increase in numbers of circulating leucocytes (Figure  5 A). Treatment with 90 mg/kg/h EA‐230 did not affect the initial decrease in leucocyte counts, whereas it subsequently resulted in higher leucocyte counts compared to the placebo group, an effect mainly attributed to increased numbers of circulating neutrophils and lymphocytes, but not monocytes (Figures  5 ). The lower dosages of EA‐230 did not influence leucocyte numbers or differentiation compared to the LPS‐response in the placebo group (Supplemental data file 1).

Grey box indicates the period in which the active group received EA‐230.  P ‐values between groups were calculated using repeated measures 2‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA, interaction term) 3.5 Effects of EA‐230 on vital signs and symptoms during endotoxaemia Endotoxaemia resulted in fever (approximately an increase in body temperature of 2°C; Figure  6 A), development of influenza‐like symptoms (Figure  6 B), a decrease in mean arterial pressure (approximately 10 mmHg; Figure  6 C), and an increase in heart rate (approximately 30 beats/min; Figure  6 D). Fever peaked at 3–3.5 hours following LPS administration and was significantly lower in subjects treated with 90 mg/kg/h EA‐230 compared to placebo (increase of 1.3 ± 0.2°C vs. 1.8 ± 0.1°C, respectively, at  t  = 3.5; Figure  6 A). Flu‐like symptoms peaked at 1.5 hours after LPS administration and were approximately halved in subjects treated with 90 mg/kg/h EA‐230 compared to placebo (4.0 ± 1.2 points vs. 7.4 ± 1.0 points respectively; Figure  6 B). The LPS‐induced effects on mean arterial pressure and heart rate were not altered by EA‐230 in any of the dosages (Supplemental data file 1). Figure 6 Clinical variables during endotoxaemia.

AU: arbitrary unit; Bpm: beats/min 3.6 Pharmacokinetics of EA‐230 during endotoxaemia Plasma EA‐230 concentration–time profiles and dose linearity are illustrated in Figure  7 . PK parameters are summarized in Table  3 . Figure  7 A illustrates that stable plasma concentrations were reached for all dosage groups within 15 minutes after start of study treatment and during the 2‐hour continuous administration period, followed by a very rapid decline in plasma concentrations after cessation of study treatment. Due to this very swift decline, the elimination rate constant β (and t 1/2 , Cl and Vd) could only be calculated in a limited number of subjects for the first 2 dosage groups (15 and 45 mg/kg/h). These analyses revealed rapid plasma elimination, with a t 1/2  of &lt;0.77 h in the 15 mg/k/h group ( n  = 3) and &lt;0.16 h in the 45 mg/kg/h ( n  = 5). In the highest dosing group, β could be estimated for all 8 subjects, and a large volume of distribution (range: 1.3–3.8 L/kg), a short elimination t 1/2  (range: 0.12–0.24 h) and a corresponding rapid clearance rate (range: 7–12 L/h/kg) for EA‐230 was apparent. The dosage increase from 15 mg/kg/h to 90 mg/kg/h resulted in proportional increases in C max  and AUC 0‐last  (Figure  7 B–C, Table  3 ). Figure 7 Pharmacokinetics of EA‐230.

Our data demonstrate that EA‐230 profoundly attenuates the systemic inflammatory response in humans  in vivo . Furthermore, we show that EA‐230 is well‐tolerated and seems to be safe for administration under inflammatory conditions. A 2‐hour infusion of EA‐230 in the highest tested dosage of 90 mg/kg/h dampened the endotoxin‐induced proinflammatory innate immune response, exemplified by attenuated plasma levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IL‐6, chemokines IL‐8, MCP‐1, MIP‐1a and MIP‐1b, and endothelial adhesion molecule VCAM‐1. Levels of the archetypal anti‐inflammatory cytokine IL‐10 were not affected by the study drug. In addition to these biochemical findings, modulation of the inflammatory response by EA‐230 was supported clinically by a significant reduction in endotoxin‐induced fever and influenza‐like symptoms. These findings are in line with preclinical studies that demonstrated that EA‐230 attenuates cytokine production, prevents tissue influx of neutrophils 24 ,  26 ,  28  and ameliorates inflammation‐related clinical symptoms 24 ,  25 ,  26 ,  28  in various models of systemic inflammation. Our data also reveal that, following the expected LPS‐induced initial leucopenia (predominantly mediated by endothelial sequestration of lymphocytes and monocytes), the subsequent increase in numbers of circulating leucocytes (predominantly due to increased neutrophil numbers released from the bone marrow) was more pronounced in EA‐230‐treated subjects. The substantial attenuation of the endotoxaemia‐induced IL‐6 response in EA‐230‐treated subjects may be of clinical relevance, as IL‐6 is implicated to play a central role in various inflammatory disorders. As such, this cytokine is regarded to be a reliable marker reflecting the magnitude of systemic inflammation, e.g. following elective surgery 38  or in patients with pneumonia. 39  Furthermore, IL‐6 levels are associated with organ failure and impaired (functional) outcome following severe injury, 40  cardiac surgery, 41  cardiac arrest, 42  stroke 43  and sepsis. 44  With respect to renal function, IL‐6 plays a critical role in the development of AKI, 45  independently predicting mortality in patients starting dialysis 46  and predicting AKI following cardiac surgery. 41  In this perspective, our results are promising and EA‐230 may show efficacy on these clinical endpoints in future studies. Administration of EA‐230 was well‐tolerated throughout the conduct of the trial and no safety issues were raised during frequent independent interim safety analyses by the DSMB and in the final results. No dose‐dependency for adverse events was observed and the percentage of subjects with 1 or more AE tended to be less common in the highest dosing group compared to the placebo group (respectively 58  vs  38%). Furthermore, all AEs in the active groups were of mild intensity and regarded unlikely or unrelated to study drug treatment. These results are consistent with earlier human phase I trials focusing on safety of EA‐230 in the absence of systemic inflammation reported elsewhere in this issue 32  and indicate that EA‐230 seems to be safe in dosages up to 90 mg/kg/h. Further safety data with higher dosages and/or longer administration duration would be needed to study a possible exposure‐dependent effect. One subject was found to be a statistically significant outlier (per Grubb's test) and was excluded for the primary efficacy analyses. When this volunteer was not excluded, the effects of EA‐230 on clinical endpoints remained statistically significant, while the effects on some of the cytokines went from statistically significant to a trend. Data on the pharmacokinetic profile of EA‐230 reveal a large volume of distribution, a very rapid systemic clearance and accordingly a short half‐life. A finding of interest is the substantially higher plasma concentrations of EA‐230 compared to the phase I continuous dosing study reported elsewhere in this issue, 32  which was performed and analysed within the same institute, using exactly the same dosing regimens (15, 45 and 90 mg/kg/h for 2‐hours). The elimination rates (β) were, however, comparable to those found in the phase I continuous dosage study. The observed increase in plasma concentrations are therefore accompanied by a decrease in Vd and Cl. These findings indicate that LPS‐induced systemic inflammation affected the pharmacokinetic behaviour of EA‐230 by decreasing the volume of distribution and increasing plasma concentration of EA‐230. As the exact mode of action of EA‐230 still remain to be elucidated, it is unclear by what mechanism(s) the inflammatory response affects the PK of EA‐230. Receptor competition with an inflammation‐dependent ligand or decreased internalization of EA‐230 during systemic inflammation may be possible explanations for the limitation of the drug's volume of distribution and subsequent increase in plasma concentrations. Taken together, the PK‐profile indicates that EA‐230 distributes over a large volume and is very rapidly metabolized with plasma clearance exceeding both renal and portal flow. This profile is affected by systemic inflammation, as reflected by the observed potentiated plasma concentrations and a lower volume of distribution during experimental human endotoxaemia. Several limitations of this study need to be addressed. The experimental human endotoxaemia model elicits a predictable and reproducible systemic inflammatory response and therefore provides a suitable model for a proof‐of‐principle study evaluating an immunomodulatory compound. However, as with any model, it has several limitations. First, LPS is a specific toll‐like receptor‐4 ligand and is administrated in a single bolus. As such, it recapitulates a 1‐hit immunological insult activating a specific pathway, which may differ from the immune response observed in clinical practice, which is often more sustained and caused by various pathogens or other immunological insults activating multiple pathways. Second, young healthy male subjects were included to minimize statistical dispersion, as age, female sex and comorbidities are known factors accounting for heterogeneity in inflammatory responses. 47 ,  48  This markedly differs from clinical practice, where diseases associated with a systemic inflammatory response occur in people of all ages, both sexes, and are frequently complicated by 1 or more comorbidities as well as the use of comedication. Therefore, the generalizability of our results to the patient population remains to be determined. Third, although all PK parameters could be determined in all subjects of the highest dosing group, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of EA‐230 (e.g. its very short half‐life) precluded assessment of elimination constant‐dependent parameters in several subjects of the lower dosage groups. However, in these subjects, plasma concentrations approaching zero (after approximately 5 times T 1/2 ) were reached within an hour, suggesting a T 1/2,  of &lt;0.2 h, which is in line with the data obtained in subjects in whom elimination constant‐dependent parameters could be assessed. Finally, the exact mechanism(s) by which EA‐230 modulates the immune response remain unclear and may have consequences for the optimal timing of administration. In the current study, steady‐state concentrations EA‐230 were present during the orchestration phase and peak (e.g. IL‐6) of the inflammatory response. In clinical practice, the timing of the inflammatory insult(s) is/are generally unknown and a subsequent more diffuse and longer lasting inflammatory response is often observed. Therefore, no definite conclusions regarding the optimal timing of administration of EA‐230 for future clinical research can be drawn from this study. In conclusion, the present proof‐of‐principle study demonstrates that EA‐230 seems to be safe and attenuates the systemic inflammatory response in humans. Substantially higher plasma concentrations of EA‐230 were observed in subjects with systemic inflammation compared to non‐inflamed subjects, which was explained by a decrease in volume of distribution and clearance, but not by differences in the elimination constant. These inflammation‐related effects on pharmacokinetic characteristics of EA‐230 need to be further elucidated. The favourable safety profile of EA‐230 and promising immunomodulatory results pave the way for a phase IIb clinical trial to assess the anti‐inflammatory and tissue‐protective effects of EA‐230 in patients. 49

    <Body>What is Already Known about this Subject 
 Sulodexide has been shown to have antihypertensive potency. Sulodexide consists of glycosaminoglycans that are known to play an important role in endothelial function and sodium homeostasis. There is a relationship between the volume of the endothelial surface layer and albuminuria. 
 What this Study Adds 
 The urine albumin–creatinine ratio is an important modifier of blood pressure responses to sulodexide treatment. Sulodexide reduces blood pressure in macroalbuminuric diabetic subjects receiving maximally tolerated renin–angiotensin‐aldosterone system inhibitor therapy. The endothelial surface layer, of which the status reflected by albuminuria levels, might represent a novel antihypertensive target in diabetes.

 Introduction Approximately one billion people in the world suffer from hypertension  4 . Despite effective antihypertensive treatment, half of the patients with hypertension have an uncontrolled blood pressure (BP)  5 ,  6 , which has been shown to increase cardiovascular risk considerably  7 . This number may be even higher in patients with diabetes, kidney disease or both. We therefore need new therapeutic inventions to improve BP control in these patients. In this context, the endothelial surface layer (ESL) is of interest. The ESL is a dynamic layer that covers the inner surface of blood vessels throughout the body. The main constituents of the ESL are proteoglycans with attached glycosaminoglycans, glycoproteins and soluble proteins. The ESL has been shown to possess many vasoprotective properties as it improves endothelial barrier function, prevents leucocyte adhesion, possesses antithrombotic effects and preserves shear‐mediated nitric oxide production  8 . In addition, endothelial glycosaminoglycans have been shown to be able to bind sodium, thereby providing an intravascular compartment for osmotically inactive sodium storage  9 . A damaged ESL, which has been observed in conditions such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease and end‐stage renal disease, may therefore have significant implications for sodium homeostasis and BP regulation  10 ,  11 ,  12 ,  13 . Consequently, ESL restoration may decrease BP. Sulodexide, an orally available mixture of glycosaminoglycans, has been shown to restore the ESL in diabetic patients  14 . A meta‐analysis that gathered BP data from eight sulodexide trials, primarily investigating diabetic nephropathy patients, has shown that sulodexide also decreases BP  15 . This was seen particularly in hypertensive patients, who showed placebo‐subtracted BP reductions that were identical to those found using current available antihypertensive drugs  15 . Considering the vasoprotective properties of the ESL and its capacity to neutralize sodium‐driven effects on volume status by osmotic inactivation, this BP‐lowering effect seems to be attributed to ESL‐restoring properties. Sulodexide may therefore be particularly effective in conditions that are characterized by ESL damage. Among diabetic patients, higher albuminuria levels are associated with a marked reduction in ESL volume  13 . In the present  post hoc  analysis of the randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled sulodexide microalbuminuria (Sun‐MICRO) and sulodexide macroalbuminuria (Sun‐MACRO) trials, we investigated whether the BP‐lowering effect of sulodexide is modified by the degree of albuminuria, in type 2 diabetic patients. Both trials were designed to investigate the potential renoprotective effect of sulodexide but did not show a reduction in albuminuria or in renal function decline  16 ,  17 . The primary objective of the present analysis was to compare the BP‐lowering effects of sulodexide and placebo among albuminuria groups. Methods Subjects and study design The Sun‐MICRO and Sun‐MACRO trials investigated the renoprotective effects of sulodexide 200 mg day –1  in subjects with type 2 diabetes and maximal tolerable renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitor therapy  16 ,  17 ,  18 . The Sun‐MICRO trial included microalbuminuric subjects [a urine albumin‐to‐creatinine ratio (UACR) of 35–200 mg g –1  in men and 45–200 mg g –1  in women] with serum creatinine levels below 1.5 mg dl –1 , whereas the Sun‐MACRO trial studied macroalbuminuric subjects (&gt;0.9 g protein 24 h –1 ) with renal impairment (serum creatinine in women 1.3–3.0 mg dl –1 ; in men 1.5–3.0 mg dl –1 ). Other inclusion and exclusion criteria were similar between both trials. Both trials started simultaneously and were performed in the same geographical areas and research centres  18 . As the rate of the primary renal endpoint, a composite of a doubling of baseline serum creatinine, development of end‐stage renal disease, or serum creatinine &gt;6.0 mg dl –1 , as well as proteinuria levels, was identical in placebo and sulodexide groups in an interim analysis of the Sun‐MACRO trial, the study was terminated early, after inclusion of 1248 subjects, with 1029 years of follow‐up. As a result of the early termination, the number of subjects that had available BP measurements decreased during the 6‐month ( n  = 702), 9‐month ( n  = 568) and 12‐month ( n  = 426) Sun‐MACRO follow‐up visits. The Sun‐MICRO trial was fully completed and the number of participants and BP recordings remained stable throughout the study. All participants gave written informed consent before enrolment in one of the studies. Both studies were approved by the appropriate local research ethics committee and performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki of the World Medical Association. All data were processed anonymously. Measurements During both studies, at each visit, three seated BP measurements were obtained 1 min apart, after at least 10 min of rest. The mean BP of these measurements was used for analysis. BP was recorded at 2‐month intervals in the Sun‐MICRO trial and at 3‐month intervals in the Sun‐MACRO trial. The target BP in both trials was &lt;130/80 mmHg. We calculated the individual BP changes from baseline to assess the effects of sulodexide and placebo. As most antihypertensive treatments exert their maximal BP‐reducing effects after 6–8 weeks, we used BP values from the first follow‐up visit to analyse whether UACR modified the observed BP effects (i.e. after 2 months or 3 months). In both trials, albuminuria was determined as the geometric mean of the ratio of urine albumin concentration to urine creatinine concentration for three consecutive first morning voided urine samples collected before the study visit. Considering that the sodium‐binding potential of ESL glycosaminoglycans might serve as an explanation for sulodexide‐associated BP changes, we analysed changes in body weight to determine whether BP changes were related to changes in extracellular volume. In addition, we analysed plasma sodium concentrations during follow‐up, and investigated whether changes in plasma sodium concentrations or body weight were associated with BP changes. Plasma sodium concentration was measured only in the Sun‐MACRO study. Statistics Data are presented as means with standard deviations, or medians with interquartile ranges when skewed. We used independent sample  t ‐tests to compare BP reductions between treatment groups. To analyse whether the degree of albuminuria affected the BP effects of sulodexide, we used a one‐way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with treatment group as the fixed effect. The following patient characteristics were assessed as possible effect modifiers: age, gender, baseline systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), body mass index (BMI) and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c). Baseline characteristics that were significantly associated with BP changes were entered in an ANCOVA model, along with UACR, to investigate whether these factors modified the BP response. For this analysis, UACR values were log transformed. Effect modification was assessed by the interaction term ‘treatment*patient characteristic’. To quantify the effects of albuminuria on the BP effects of sulodexide, we plotted the estimated SBP effects in a linear regression analysis and divided subjects in groups with an UACR of &lt;300 mg g –1 , 300–1000 mg g –1  and &gt;1000 mg g –1 . To compare SBP, DBP, body weight and plasma sodium changes following sulodexide and placebo treatment during follow‐up, we used a general linear model for repeated measurements, with correction for baseline values. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (Version 21.0, SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) Results Study population BP measurements of 1056 and 843 subjects were available in the Sun‐MICRO and Sun‐MACRO trial, respectively. The average baseline BP was 131/74 mmHg in the Sun‐MICRO trial and 138/73 mmHg in the Sun‐MACRO trial. In comparison to the Sun‐MICRO trial, subjects included in the Sun‐MACRO trial had a lower eGFR and higher UACR at baseline (Table  1 ).

In microalbuminuric subjects, sulodexide did not change BP relative to placebo. After 2 months, we observed comparable SBP changes in the sulodexide (1.3 ± 11.3 mmHg) and placebo (1.3 ± 11.7 mmHg) groups (placebo  vs.  sulodexide;  P  = 0.94). During the 26‐week follow‐up period in which the subjects remained on the study drug, SBP remained identical in both groups (Figure  1 A). DBP was also similar in both groups during follow‐up. Interestingly, sulodexide‐ and placebo‐treated macroalbuminuric subjects showed an opposite SBP response after 3 months: SBP decreased in the sulodexide group by 0.9 ± 18.2 mmHg, while it increased in the placebo group by 1.7 ± 17.9 mmHg (placebo  vs.  sulodexide;  P  = 0.04). This SBP difference between sulodexide and placebo persisted after 6 months (−0.6 ± 17.8 mmHg  vs.  +2.3 ± 20.3 mmHg;  P  = 0.046). On average, SBP was 2.4 mmHg ( P  = 0.020) lower in the sulodexide group during the first year of treatment (Figure  1 B). DBP did not differ between the groups. Figure 1 Sulodexide reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP) in patients with macroalbuminuria. Estimated marginal means (standard error of the mean) of SBP at baseline and after treatment with sulodexide and placebo in the sulodexide microalbuminuria (Sun‐MICRO) (A) and sulodexide macroalbuminuria (Sun‐MACRO) (B) trials. In patients with microalbuminuria, SBP was identical in both groups ( P  = 0.88). In macroalbuminuric patients, SBP was, on average, 2.4 mmHg lower [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.4, 4.4;  P  = 0.020) in the sulodexide group ( n  = 204) when compared with placebo ( n  = 198). We used a general linear model repeated measures test, with correction for baseline SBP for calculations BP effect determinants As albuminuria levels correlate with ESL status and may therefore affect the BP response to sulodexide, we analysed whether SBP changes were modified by baseline UACR. We observed a significant interaction between treatment and baseline UACR ( P  = 0.001), indicating that the SBP effects of sulodexide were modified by baseline BP (Table  2 , Figure  2 A). Other potential characteristics, including SBP ( P  = 0.98 for interaction) and DBP ( P  = 0.93 for interaction), did not show an interaction with treatment. The interaction between baseline UACR and treatment remained significant after adjustment for trial, baseline age, gender, eGFR, BMI and HbA1c. Consequently, the largest SBP changes between the placebo and sulodexide groups were observed in subjects with the highest degree of albuminuria. Subjects with an UACR &gt;1000 mg g –1  who received sulodexide treatment had a 4.6 mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.6, 5.6;  P  &lt; 0.001] lower SBP than the placebo‐treated subjects (Figure  2 B). In subjects with an UACR between 300 mg g –1  and 1000 mg g –1 , SBP was, on average, 2.3 mmHg (95% CI: 0.9, 3.7;  P  = 0.001) lower in the sulodexide group ( P  = 0.001). Microalbuminuric (&lt;300 mg g –1 ) patients had similar BP changes following sulodexide and placebo treatment in this combined analysis of both studies (0.2 mmHg, 95% CI −0.5, 0.8;  P  = 0.60; Figure  2 B). Table 2 Effect of urine albumin‐to‐creatinine ratio (UACR) on blood pressure (BP) changes induced by sulodexide. The results of the analysis of covariance model that was used to investigate whether baseline BP or UACR significantly affected the systolic BP (SBP) change that was observed after sulodexide or placebo treatment (upper five rows with green background). To test whether baseline BP or UACR modified the SBP change in placebo and sulodexide groups differently, we tested for an interaction between the included patient characteristics and treatment (lower three rows with white background). We observed a significant interaction for baseline UACR, but not for SBP or diastolic BP (DBP), indicating that the BP effects of sulodexide are modified by baseline UACR only. The represented values for treatment, trial, and baseline UACR, SBP and DBP were calculated without taking into account the effect of any interaction. The significance of each interaction was calculated separately Figure 2 The blood pressure (BP)‐lowering potential of sulodexide depends on albuminuria severity. (A) Regression lines and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) demonstrating the significant interaction ( P  = 0.001) between the baseline urine albumin‐to‐creatinine ratio (UACR) and treatment arms (placebo  vs . sulodexide). The regression line slopes of placebo ( P  &lt; 0.001) and sulodexide ( P  &lt; 0.001) were both significantly different from zero. (B) Quantitative analysis of the results of the ANCOVA, showing that subjects with an UACR &gt;1000 mg g –1  benefit most from sulodexide treatment in terms of BP (mean and 95% CI). Sulodexide resulted in a 2.0 mmHg (95% CI −2.6, −1.3) systolic BP (SBP) reduction, while placebo increased SBP by 2.5 mmHg (95% CI 1.9, 3.3). In the group with an UACR between 300–1000 mg g –1 , sulodexide decreased BP by 0.8 mmHg (95% CI −1.8, 0.2) and placebo increased BP by 1.6 mmHg (95% CI 0.6, 2.5), while subjects with an UACR &lt;300 mg g –1  had an identical BP response (0.2 mmHg, 95% CI −0.5, 0.8;  P  = 0.60) As severe proteinuria may be a reflection of podocytopathy rather than additional damage to the endothelium and ESL, we analysed the SBP changes in subgroups of patients with an UACR &gt;1000 mg g –1 . Although the difference in SBP change remained significant between placebo and sulodexide in subgroups with an UACR of 1000–2000, 2000–3000 and &gt;3000, the SBP changes were identical among these subgroups for placebo ( P  = 0.38) and sulodexide ( P  = 0.66). To test the robustness of our results, we analysed the Sun‐MICRO and Sun‐MACRO study separately. This analysis demonstrated similar results, showing that baseline UACR was not a determinant of SBP change in Sun‐MICRO, whereas a significant interaction between treatment and UACR was demonstrated in Sun‐MACRO (data not shown). Plasma sodium and body weight To explore whether sulodexide affected extracellular volume regulation by osmotic inactivation of sodium, we analysed plasma sodium concentration and body weight. Body weight remained identical in sulodexide‐ and placebo‐treated subjects from Sun‐MICRO during follow‐up ( P  = 0.12). In the Sun‐MACRO study, plasma sodium concentrations decreased in the placebo (−0.3 ± 2.9 mmol l –1 ;  P  = 0.03) and sulodexide (−0.6 ± 3.0 mmol l –1 ;  P  &lt; 0.001) groups to a similar extent after 3 months ( P  = 0.07). During the same period, plasma glucose increased similarly after placebo (1.0 ± 5.0 mmol l –1 ;  P  &lt; 0.001) and sulodexide treatment (0.7 ± 4.8 mmol l –1 ;  P  = 0.001). Similar to the results in microalbuminuric subjects, body weight remained similar in macroalbuminuric subjects during follow‐up ( P  = 0.83). Discussion The present  post hoc  analysis demonstrated that the BP‐reducing potency of sulodexide depends on nephropathy severity in subjects with type 2 diabetes and maximum tolerated renin–angiotensin‐aldosterone system inhibitor therapy. Relative to placebo treatment, the largest BP reductions after sulodexide treatment were seen in subjects with the highest degree of albuminuria (&gt;1000 mg g –1 ), who showed an additional 5 mmHg SBP reduction, despite a well‐controlled average BP at baseline. In microalbuminuric patients (UACR &lt;300 mg g –1 ), sulodexide and placebo had similar effects on SBP. Considering the high cardiovascular risk of patients with severe diabetic nephropathy, it is likely that the observed added BP‐lowering effect of sulodexide translates into a further reduction of cardiovascular risk. A meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials that investigated sulodexide has recently reported on the so‐far overlooked systemic BP effects of sulodexide  15 . In this previous analysis, in which albuminuria could not be studied, baseline BP was identified as the most important determinant of the observed BP response. In the current  post hoc  analysis, we were able to analyse individual patient data, including albuminuria. However, we could not reproduce this finding using data from two large trials, in which average BP was well controlled. Although baseline SBP was the most important factor affecting SBP responses, we observed similar associations for placebo and sulodexide treatment groups. This indicates that the association between baseline BP and the SBP response is most likely caused by a regression‐to‐the‐mean phenomenon. As the inclusion BP was 150/90 mmHg and 160/100 mmHg in the Sun‐MICRO and Sun‐MACRO studies, respectively, we were not able to draw any conclusions for BP values above these levels. The most likely explanation for the absent DBP response after sulodexide treatment is the low baseline DBP. Albuminuria is known to be a sign of kidney damage but may also represent systemic vascular disease  19 . In this respect, the ESL is an interesting vascular entity as it is involved in both systemic vascular function and glomerular permeability (i.e. albuminuria). In rats, for example, mesenteric and vascular ESL thicknesses were both negatively correlated with proteinuria  20 . This relationship has also been observed in humans. In subjects with type 1 diabetes, the presence of albuminuria was associated with a 75% reduction in systemic ESL volume in comparison with nonalbuminuric controls  13 . These studies suggest that albuminuria reflects systemic ESL damage. As sulodexide is known to restore a damaged ESL in diabetic patients, one may therefore expect that subjects with a higher degree of albuminuria (i.e. a smaller systemic ESL volume) may benefit most from sulodexide therapy  14 . This is in line with the results of the present  post hoc  analysis, in which subjects with a higher degree of albuminuria, who may benefit most from sulodexide in terms of ESL restoration, showed the largest BP reductions. However, proteinuria levels above 1 g are generally thought to be caused by podocyte injury rather than by additional glomerular ESL damage. As the BP‐lowering effects of sulodexide may be ascribed to ESL restoration, BP may not decrease any further under conditions of severe proteinuria. Indeed, in our subgroup analysis of subjects with UACR levels &gt;1000 mg g –1 , we observed that SBP changes between placebo and sulodexide remained significant but did not increase further. The BP‐lowering potential of sulodexide may be explained by several mechanisms, all of which can be attributed to an increased ESL volume. Firstly, the ESL is an important mediator of shear‐mediated nitric oxide production. Secondly, ESL glycosaminoglycans have been shown to be able to bind to and osmotically inactivate sodium, thereby reducing the amount of osmotically active sodium, which prevents water retention and a subsequent BP increase  9 ,  10 ,  21 . Both mechanisms may be responsible for the observation that the largest BP reductions after sulodexide treatment were seen in subjects with the highest degree of albuminuria. The observed reduction in BP was not characterized by any change in body weight, suggesting that extracellular volume remained identical. However, plasma sodium concentration decreased twice as much after sulodexide treatment than after placebo, albeit not significantly. Although the 0.6 mmol l –1  decrease may seem marginal, it is similar to reductions in plasma sodium concentration achieved with long‐term modest salt reduction  22 . The absence of a weight change, together with the decrease in plasma sodium concentration that was seen alongside the BP reduction, indicates that sulodexide‐treated patients had less osmotically active sodium per litre of body water. This suggests that sulodexide is able to increase the capacity for non‐osmotic sodium storage. As these studies lacked data on extracellular volume or total body water, these results should be interpreted cautiously, and future studies should investigate whether sulodexide interferes with sodium and volume homeostasis. Besides albuminuria, plasma glucose has been reported to affect ESL status  23 . In the present analysis, however, we were not able to demonstrate an association between plasma glucose and SBP response, either in micro‐ or macroalbuminuric subjects. This may be explained by the fact that a previous study observed differences in ESL status while examining large intraindividual plasma glucose differences, whereas we assessed small interindividual differences in the present study. In addition, eGFR has been shown to affect ESL volume  11  but was not associated with the SBP response in the present study. However, Padberg  et al.  observed a similar association between both syndecan‐1, an ESL‐shedding product, and proteinuria as well as between syndecan‐1 and eGFR  11 . As a decrease in eGFR and development of albuminuria are both hallmarks of diabetic nephropathy, it is difficult to assess which factor may be responsible for the reduction in ESL volume. Similar to the previously mentioned meta‐analysis, the present  post hoc  analysis suggests that future studies should take the systemic BP effects into account when analysing the potential renoprotective effects of sulodexide  15 . In both analyses, changes in BP and in UACR showed a significant correlation with a regression line that had a y‐intercept similar to zero. The strength of the present study was the availability of individual patient data from two large randomized placebo‐controlled trials  24 . To cover all ranges of albuminuria, we pooled the data from the Sun‐MICRO and Sun‐MACRO trials to investigate whether baseline albuminuria modified the SBP responses. Although both trials were comparable with regard to design, participating centres and measurements, possible differences between studies could have induced bias. However, we observed similar results in separate analyses of the Sun‐MICRO and Sun‐MACRO trials. In addition, we included trial as a covariate in the regression analysis, which did not appear to have a significant influence. A potential limitation of the present analysis was the lack of 24 h BP data, which may have been of additive value. Another potential limitation was that patients were permitted to use adjunctive antihypertensive agents. However, as both micro‐ and macroalbuminuric subjects were allowed to take additional agents, and both trials were double blinded, this effect was not likely to influence our results significantly. Due to the nature of a  post hoc  analysis, we were not able to prove causality, so these results should be interpreted cautiously. Conclusion The present  post hoc  analysis of the randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled Sun‐MICRO and Sun‐MACRO trials showed that the BP‐reducing potency of sulodexide is modified by the degree of albuminuria in type 2 diabetic patients. Although the average subject was normotensive, sulodexide reduced SBP by 5 mmHg in diabetic subjects with the highest degree of albuminuria, indicating that sulodexide may help to control BP in patients with severe diabetic nephropathy. As the degree of albuminuria is generally believed to relate to ESL damage, our findings indicate that ESL restoration may represent a new target for BP treatment.

    <Abstact>Evidence suggests that probiotic bacteria modulate both innate and adaptive immunity in the host, and in some situations can result in reduced severity of common illnesses, such as acute rotavirus infection and respiratory infections. Responses to vaccination are increasingly being used to provide high quality information on the immunomodulatory effects of dietary components in humans. The present review focuses on the effect of probiotic administration upon vaccination response. The majority of studies investigating the impact of probiotics on responses to vaccination have been conducted in healthy adults, and at best they show modest effects of probiotics on serum or salivary IgA titres. Studies in infants and in elderly subjects are very limited, and it is too early to draw any firm conclusions regarding the potential for probiotics to act as adjuvants in vaccination. Although some studies are comparable in terms of duration of the intervention, age and characteristics of the subjects, most differ in terms of the probiotic selected. Further well designed, randomized, placebo‐controlled studies are needed to understand fully the immunomodulatory properties of probiotics, whether the effects exerted are strain‐dependent and age‐dependent and their clinical relevance in enhancing immune protection following vaccination.</Abstact>
    <Body>Introduction Evidence suggests that probiotic bacteria reduce the risk, and in some cases duration or severity, of infections [ 1 ]. In infants, a number of studies have demonstrated that probiotics reduce the clinical symptoms of diarrhoeal disease, particularly in acute rotavirus infection [ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ]. Most studies have shown that lactobacilli and bifidobacteria reduce the risk of antibiotic‐associated diarrhoea, but data relating to duration and severity are inconsistent, perhaps due to some influence of the condition that the patient was being treated for [ 1 ]. Consumption of some probiotic strains may reduce incidence and/or severity of respiratory infections in children [ 7 – 9 ], adults [ b10 ] and in the elderly [ b11 ], although evidence is limited and studies investigating prevention of common respiratory illnesses have produced mixed results [ 1 ]. A recent systematic review identified 14randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of probiotics for the prevention of upper or lower respiratory infections [ b12 ]. The review concluded that 10 of these RCTs demonstrated no evidence of beneficial effects of probiotics on the incidence of respiratory disease, five out of six providing relevant data demonstrated a reduction in symptom severity, and three out of nine reported a shorter clinical course of infection in the probiotic groups [ b12 ]. Response to vaccination is increasingly being used as a surrogate for the response to infection and can therefore provide information on the immunomodulatory effects of dietary components, including probiotics, in humans [ b13 ]. Vaccine efficacy can be assessed by levels of vaccine‐specific antibodies in the serum following vaccination, which directly correlate with protection and are described as a ‘gold‐standard’ for determining the influence of probiotics on immune responses [ b14 ]. This review discusses the theoretical basis for modulation of immune response to vaccination by probiotics, and describes published studies investigating the impact of concomitant probiotic administration on the response to vaccination in infants, adults and elderly individuals. Theoretical basis for modulation of immune response to vaccination by probiotics Probiotics may influence immune function by direct and indirect actions. Direct effects include changes to the gut microbiota and alteration of the profile of pathogen‐associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) presented to the gut associated lymphoid tissue. Indirect effects could arise from microbial products such as short chain fatty acids [ b15 ]. Evidence from animal models indicates that the resident gut microbiota shapes anti‐viral defences and modulates the outcome of viral infections, with germ free mice more susceptible to a number of infections, including influenza [ b16 ]. Experiments with specific pathogen‐free (SPF) mice treated with antibiotics support this. Antibiotic‐treated SPF mice given a sub lethal dose of PR8 virus had impaired generation of virus specific antibody, cluster of differentiation 4+ (CD4+) and CD8+ T cell responses and delayed viral clearance [ b16 ]. Treatment with antibiotics also reduced migration of respiratory dendritic cells from the lung to the draining lymph node during influenza infection and, as a result, there was a reduction in the priming of naïve antigen specific CD8+ T cells [ b17 ]. Animal studies using antibiotics have identified specific classes of bacteria involved in maintaining immunity against viral infection. For example, neomycin almost completely eliminates  Lactobacillus  spp. and results in impairment of influenza‐specific CD8+ T cell responses, suggesting that neomycin sensitive bacteria in the gut support the immune response to influenza infection [ b16 ]. Gut microbes are also suggested to support immune responses against viral infections through inflammasome‐mediated cytokine release. Antibiotic‐treated mice have reduced levels of interleukin‐1β (IL‐1β) secretion in the lung during influenza infection, suggesting that gut‐resident bacteria support cytokine production [ b16 ]. It has been speculated that gut microbes release low concentrations of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) ligands, which provide signals for inflammasome‐mediated cytokine release (for example, in the lung during influenza infection). These in turn regulate the activity of respiratory dendritic cells during activation of adaptive immunity against the virus [ b16 ]. Evidence that gut‐resident bacteria play a role in shaping immune defences form the basis for the hypothesis that probiotics may modulate responses to infection or vaccination. However, the mechanisms by which probiotics modulate the immune system, particularly in the context of vaccination, are not clear. A recent animal study demonstrated that the probiotic,  Lactobacillus gasseri , led to diversification of B cell populations in the lamina propria of the murine colon  in vivo . This organism was proposed as a vaccine vector for oral immunization against mucosal pathogens [ b18 ]. Another study demonstrated that  Lactobacillus paracasei  subsp.  paracasei  NTU 101 fed daily to mice for 3 to 9 weeks induced stronger interactions between CD4+ T cells and dendritic cells and enhanced proliferation of CD4+ T cells and B cells [ b19 ]. Thus, there is compelling evidence that resident bacteria in the gastro‐intestinal tract influence the immune response to viral infections. However specific data relating to vaccination responses is lacking. The following sections review published studies investigating the impact of concomitant probiotic administration on the response to vaccination in humans. Studies in infants Oral vaccines Two studies investigated the effects of probiotics on responses to oral vaccines in infants. One study examined the influence of  Lactobacillus casei  strain GG (currently known as  Lactobacillus rhamnosus  GG or LGG) on the oral rotavirus vaccine [ b20 ], and the other examined the effect of the  Bifidobacterium breve  strain in Yakult (BBG‐01) on the oral cholera vaccine [ b21 ] (see  Table 1 ). In the first study, 2–5‐month‐old infants were given LGG or a placebo immediately before receiving the oral rotavirus vaccine (D x RRV) and for the subsequent 5 days [ b20 ]. LGG significantly increased the number of rotavirus‐specific Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody secreting cells 8 days after vaccination, and a trend for higher rotavirus‐specific IgA antibody titres was also observed in the probiotic group compared with the placebo group ( P  = 0.05).

In contrast, there was no effect of  Bifidobacterium breve  strain Yakult (BBG‐01), given for 4 weeks, on the response to oral cholera vaccine in 2–5‐year‐old Bangladeshi children [ b21 ]. There were significantly lower proportion of responders in the probiotic group for some viral‐specific IgA antibodies compared with the placebo group. This was particularly evident in the younger infants. Parenteral vaccines Five studies investigated the effects of probiotics on responses to parenteral vaccines in infants ( Table 1 ). Kukkonen  et al . [ b22 ], investigated the effect of a mixture of four probiotics combined with the prebiotic galacto‐oligosaccharide (GOS) on antibody responses to diphtheria, tetanus and  Haemophilus influenza  type b (Hib) vaccination in allergy‐prone infants. Pregnant mothers received the probiotics during their last month of pregnancy, and the same mixture was given in combination with GOS syrup to their newborns for 6 months. Vaccines were administered at 3, 4 and 5 months and antibody titres were measured at 6 months. A protective Hib‐specific IgG antibody response (&gt;1 μg ml −1 ) occurred more frequently in the probiotic group (16 of 29 infants) compared with the placebo group (6 of 25 infants), but there were no significant differences in vaccine‐specific antibody titres between groups. In a similar study, the probiotic  Lactobacillus acidophilus  LAVR1‐A1 (Probiomics) was fed to allergy‐prone infants for the first 6 months of life and the response to tetanus vaccine was assessed at 2, 4 and 6 months [ b23 ]. The probiotic decreased the IL‐10 response to tetanus toxoid antigen at 6 months compared with the placebo group and reduced IL‐5 and transforming growth factor‐β (TGF‐β) release by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) following stimulation with Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB). However, antibody responses to the vaccine were not reported. In the study by West  et al . [ b24 ], 4‐month‐old infants were provided with a cereal containing  Lactobacillus paracasei  ssp.  paracasei  strain F19 (LF19), or the same cereal without probiotic, daily for 9 months. The infants were immunized with DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus toxoid and acellular pertussis), polio and Hib vaccines at 3, 5.5 and 12 months. There was no significant effect of the probiotic on antibody titres to Hib, diphtheria and tetanus antigens measured before and after the second and third doses of vaccines. However, adjustment for breastfeeding duration suggested that the probiotic enhanced anti‐diphtheria antibody titres in infants breastfed for less than 6 months. A similar effect was observed for tetanus antigen, but there was no effect of LF19 on Hib vaccination. Soh  et al . [ b25 ] examined the response to hepatitis B (HepB) vaccination in allergy‐prone infants fed formula supplemented with  Bifidobacterium longum  BL999 and  Lactobacillus rhamnosus  LPR or a control formula without probiotics for the first 6 months of life. All infants received a monovalent HepB vaccine at birth and 1 month of age, and at 6 months they received either the monovalent HepB vaccine or a hexavalent diphtheria‐tetanus‐acellular pertussis (DTaP) combination vaccine containing a HepB component. There was a trend for the probiotic mix to increase HepB virus surface antibody (HBsAb) responses in those infants receiving HepB + DTaP, but this was not statistically significant, and there was no effect of probiotics in infants receiving the monovalent HepB. Finally, in the study by Youngster  et al . [ b26 ], 8–10‐month‐old infants were provided with a probiotic formulation comprising  Lactobacillus acidophilus  ATCC4356,  Bifidobacterium bifidum  DSMZ20082,  Bifidobacterium longum  ATCC157078 and  Bifidobacterium infantis  ATCC15697 (Altman Probiotic Kid Powder) for 5 months in total, beginning 2 months prior to vaccination against mumps, measles, rubella and varicella (MMRV) [ b26 ]. While there was no significant difference in protective antibody titres to each individual vaccine component, when all antibody results were combined, there was a trend towards a greater percentage of infants reaching protective IgG antibody titres 3 months post‐vaccination in the probiotic group [ b26 ]. Summary of studies in infants There are a limited number of studies investigating the influence of probiotics on vaccination in infants and the effects are not clear. At best, there are trends towards better responses to vaccination in some of the studies, but effects are clearly limited. Although some studies are comparable in terms of duration of the intervention, age and characteristics of the infants, the probiotics administered are different in every case. Further research is required to compare the effects of different probiotics within a standardized study design. Studies in adults Seven studies have investigated the influence of probiotics on response to vaccination in adults, four of these employing oral vaccines, two employing parenteral vaccines, and one a nasally administered vaccine ( Table 2 ).

 Davidson  et al  (2011) [ b33 ] cfu, colony‐forming units. Oral vaccines Fermented milk containing  Lactobacillus acidophilus  La1 and  Bifidobacterium  Bb12 consumed for 3 weeks significantly increased the vaccine‐specific serum IgA titres to an attenuated  Salmonella typhi  Ty21a oral vaccine given on days 7, 9 and 11 [ b27 ]. In a separate study, LGG taken for 7 days tended to increase vaccine‐specific IgA antibodies to the  Salmonella typhi  Ty21a oral vaccine administered on days 1, 3 and 5 [ b28 ]. However, there was no effect of  Lactococcus lactis , and no effect of either probiotic on the numbers of vaccine specific IgA, IgG or IgM antibody secreting cells 7 days post‐vaccination [ b28 ]. Vaccine‐specific IgA titre to an oral poliovirus vaccine was increased by LGG and  Lactobacillus paracasei  ssp . paracasei  (CRL431) during a 5 week intervention, with the live attenuated poliomyelitis virus vaccine being administered on day 8 [ b29 ]. Those receiving the probiotics had a significantly greater increase in neutralizing antibodies compared with a placebo group. There was also a minor effect on poliovirus serotype‐1‐specific IgG and on serotype‐2‐and ‐3‐specific IgM antibody titres [ b29 ]. Strain specific effects of probiotics on response to an oral cholera vaccine were explored by Paineau  et al . [ b30 ]. Healthy adult volunteers were assigned to one of seven probiotics (members of the genera  Lactobacillus  and  Bifidobacterium ) or placebo for 21 days and received the oral cholera vaccine on days 7 and 14.  Bifidobacterium lactis  Bi‐04 and  Lactobacillus acidophilus  La‐14 significantly increased vaccine‐specific serum IgG antibody levels on day 21, and there was a similar trend for  Bifidobacterium lactis  Bi‐07 and  Lactobaacillus plantarum  Lp‐115. However, there were no significant effects of probiotics on vaccine‐specific serum IgA or IgM antibodies [ b30 ]. Parenteral vaccines Three studies have examined the potential adjuvant properties of probiotics given in conjunction with parenteral or nasally administered influenza vaccines ( Table 2 ). In the first study,  Lactobacillus fermentum  CECT5716, taken for 4 weeks, significantly increased titres of influenza virus‐specific plasma IgA (but not IgM or IgG) to the inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine for the vaccine campaign of 2004/2005, administered 2 weeks into the intervention [ b31 ]. Additionally, the incidence of influenza‐like illnesses for 5 months post‐vaccination were lower in the probiotic group compared with the control group [ b31 ]. In the second study, both  Bifidobacterium animalis  ssp.  lactis  (BB‐12®) and  Lactobacillus paracasei  ssp.  paracasei  ( L. casei  431®) taken for 6 weeks increased influenza vaccine‐specific serum IgG and vaccine‐specific salivary sIgA titres after vaccination at 2 weeks in the 2008/2009 campaign [ b32 ]. There was no effect of either probiotic on vaccine‐specific serum IgA or IgMon plasma cytokine concentrations or on parameters of innate immunity [ b32 ]. Finally, LGG taken for 28 days immediately after receiving a nasally administered trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine from the campaign of 2007/2008 significantly increased seroprotection (haemagglutinin inhibition [HAI] antibody titre = 40) to the H3N2 virus strain, but not to the H1N1 or B strain at day 28 [ b33 ]. However, at day 56 the rates of seroconversion (at least a four‐fold rise in HAI antibody titre) were not significantly different. Summary of studies in adults Overall, some studies in adults demonstrate an increase in vaccine‐specific serum IgA concentrations, but this is not entirely consistent. Effects on other Ig subclasses and on seroprotection/seroconversion are unclear. Studies in elderly subjects Three studies examined the effect of probiotics on the response to parenteral influenza vaccines in elderly subjects ( Table 3 ). This is a particularly important group for consideration because of the impact of immunosenescence on response to vaccination, and the consequences of respiratory infections in older people [ b34 ]. Bunout  et al . [ b35 ], examined the effects of a complete nutritional formula containing a range of nutrients and vitamins plus the probiotic  Lactobacillus paracasei  (NCC 2461) and the prebiotic fructo‐oligosaccharide for 6 months on the response to influenza and pneumococcal vaccines (given at 4 months) in free‐living Chilean subjects over 70‐years‐old. At 12 months there was a significantly lower incidence of infection, in particular, respiratory infection, in the treatment group compared with the control group, but there was no effect on antibody responses to either vaccine [ b35 ]. Boge  et al . [ b36 ], conducted an intervention trial of a probiotic drink containing  Lactobacillus paracasei  ssp.  paracasei  (Actimel®) on the response to influenza vaccination in healthy elderly volunteers (&gt;70 years). This trial was conducted in two phases: a pilot study in 2005–2006 (probiotic/placebo consumed for 7 weeks), followed by a confirmatory study in 2006–2007 (probiotic/placebo consumed for 13 weeks), with the inactivated influenza virus vaccine being administered during the fourth week of intervention. H1N1 was the only vaccine strain common to both phases of the study, with the H3N2 and B strains being different between vaccination seasons. In both phases of the trial, the probiotic group exhibited higher virus‐specific antibody titres post‐vaccination compared with the control group, although these differences were only statistically significant within the confirmatory phase [ b36 ]. The intensity of the probiotic effect was vaccine subtype‐dependent, with the most pronounced enhancement for the influenza virus H3N2 strain in the pilot and the B strain in the confirmatory study. Seroconversion rates within the probiotic group in the confirmatory phase were significantly higher for the B strain at 3, 6 and 9 weeks post‐vaccination compared with the placebo group ( P  = 0.02), but there was no effect of the probiotic on seroconversion for the H1N1 or H3N2 strains [ b36 ]. It is perhaps pertinent to note that the B strain is known to show major human variability, and the effects on this subtype therefore need to be interpreted with caution. The third study is not included in  Table 3  because of an unusual study design, which makes the data very difficult to interpret [ b37 ]. In this small study, 27 elderly subjects consumed a test food containing  Bifidobacterium longum  BB536 for 5 weeks, with an influenza vaccination (2004/2005 campaign) being given at 3 weeks. At 5 weeks, the subjects were then randomized to either continue on the probiotic, or to consume a placebo for a further 14 weeks. The randomization was stratified for gender and H3N2 titres, but not for overall protection, so that the proportion of subjects with effective titre was 53.8% in the BB536 group and 28.6% in the placebo group [ b37 ]. Although the paper reports significantly lower incidence of influenza and fever in the probiotic group, the subject numbers are extremely small, and these data should probably be disregarded.

Summary of studies in elderly subjects Studies are very limited, and it is too early to draw any conclusions regarding the potential influence of probiotics on the response to influenza vaccination in elderly subjects. More research is required. Conclusion The majority of studies investigating the impact of probiotics on responses to vaccination have been conducted in healthy adults, and at best they show modest effects of probiotics on serum or salivary IgA titres. Studies in infants and in elderly subjects are very limited, and it is too early to draw any firm conclusions regarding the potential for probiotics to act as adjuvants in vaccination. There is strong evidence that probiotics reduce the incidence and duration of diarrhoeal infection among infants and adults [ 1 ]. Further studies of the effect of probiotics on the response to rotavirus and cholera vaccination in infants and cholera or Salmonella vaccination in adults would therefore be of interest. Evidence suggests that probiotics can reduce the duration, but not the incidence, of common respiratory illnesses [ 1 ]. Two studies which monitored the incidence and duration of cold and flu‐like symptoms following Influenza vaccination have indeed identified a lower incidence of infections among those receiving probiotic treatment [ b31 , b35 ]. Influenza vaccination provides a particularly useful tool because it is used in routine clinical practice in elderly people, in whom seroprotection and seroconversion rates are low and correlate with poor protection. Unfortunately, very few of the studies published to date have reported rates of seroprotection and seroconversion. This information is critical in evaluating the potential clinical benefits of probiotics as adjuvants for vaccination. Further well designed, randomized, placebo‐controlled studies are needed to understand fully the immunomodulatory properties of probiotics, whether the effects exerted are strain and age‐dependent, and their clinical relevance in enhancing protection following vaccination. </Body>

    <Body>What is Already Known about this Subject 
 Gastrointestinal NHE3 indirectly affects intestinal H + ‐coupled transporters. Tenapanor, a locally‐acting, minimally‐absorbed NHE3 inhibitor, is being investigated for the treatment of patients with IBS‐C and for the treatment of hyperphosphataemia in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis. Cefadroxil, a β‐lactam antibiotic, is transported by the H + ‐coupled transporter PepT1. 
 What this Study Adds 
 Repeated oral dosing of tenapanor did not have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of the model PepT1‐transported drug cefadroxil in healthy volunteers. This suggests that pharmacological inhibition of NHE3 by tenapanor is unlikely to have an impact on uptake of drugs mediated by the H + ‐coupled transporter PepT1 in humans.

 Introduction 
 Sodium/hydrogen (Na + /H + ) exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3)  3  plays an important role in sodium transport and fluid homeostasis in the gastrointestinal tract  4 ,  5 . Tenapanor (RDX5791, AZD1722) is a minimally‐absorbed, highly‐selective, small‐molecule inhibitor of gastrointestinal NHE3 that reduces the uptake of dietary sodium and phosphate  3 ,  6 . Tenapanor is currently in development for the treatment of patients with constipation‐predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS‐C) ( ClinicalTrials.gov  identifiers: NCT01923428  7 , NCT02621892  8 , NCT02686138  9 ), and for the treatment of hyperphosphataemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis ( ClinicalTrials.gov  identifiers: NCT02081534  10 , NCT02675998  11 ). An important step in drug development is to identify any possible drug–drug interactions. As tenapanor has minimal systemic availability, it is unlikely to have effects outside of the gut. In the small intestine, a region of mildly acidic pH (6.1–6.8) adjacent to the luminal surface of the epithelium, known as the acid microclimate, is important for the absorption of molecules from the gut  12 . A range of H + ‐coupled transporter proteins use the acid microclimate as a driving force for the uptake of molecules across the apical brush‐border membrane  13 ,  14 . This includes transporters of dipeptides and tripeptides, amino acids, vitamins and organic cations  13 . NHE3 is present in the apical membrane of gastrointestinal epithelial cells and is expressed more highly in the small intestine than in the colon  15 ,  16 . NHE3 has a major role in the uptake of dietary sodium from the intestinal lumen, in an electroneutral manner, through proton exchange  4 . This H +  secretion into the gut lumen plays an important role in generating and maintaining the acid microclimate  12 ,  17 . An NHE3 inhibitor could therefore reduce apical H +  secretion, alter the pH of the microclimate and potentially lead to indirect inhibition of H + ‐coupled transporter activity. H + ‐coupled peptide transporter 1 (PepT1) is highly expressed throughout the small intestine and is localized to the brush‐border membrane. It is a high‐capacity transporter, with relatively low affinity for a wide range of compounds  13 ,  18 . In addition to transporting dipeptides and tripeptides arising from protein digestion, PepT1 has also been shown to transport a range of hydrophilic oral drugs, including many β‐lactam antibiotics  13 ,  14 ,  19 . Inhibiting NHE3 activity, by either removing extracellular Na +  or using the NHE3‐selective inhibitor S1611, reduces transepithelial peptide transport by PepT1  in vitro , suggesting that NHE3 contributes to PepT1 transport activity by maintaining the acid microclimate through Na + /H +  exchange  20 ,  21 . Therefore, by pharmacologically inhibiting NHE3, tenapanor has the potential to affect PepT1‐mediated drug uptake. Based on these theoretical considerations, this phase 1 study was conducted to assess whether tenapanor has a clinically relevant impact on the transport activity of the H + ‐coupled transporter PepT1 in humans, by evaluating the pharmacokinetics of the model PepT1‐transported drug cefadroxil  14 ,  20 ,  22  when administered alone or in combination with tenapanor. 
 Methods 
 The drug/molecular target nomenclature used in this article conforms to the Concise Guide to PHARMACOLOGY 2015/16  2 . Study design This was a phase 1, randomized, open‐label, two‐period crossover study ( ClinicalTrials.gov  identifier: NCT02140281) conducted by a contract research organization at a single study centre (Quintiles, Overland Park, KS, USA). The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and International Conference on Harmonisation and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The study protocol and an amendment were approved by the MidLands Independent Review Board (Overland Park, KS, USA). All study volunteers provided written informed consent before undergoing any study procedure. Participants Healthy men and women, aged 18–50 years, with a body mass index of 18–30 kg m –2  and weighing 50–100 kg, were eligible for enrolment in the study. Women of childbearing potential could not be pregnant and had to use effective contraception during the study period. Men were also required to use effective contraception. Volunteers were required to have suitable veins for cannulation or repeated venepuncture. Key exclusion criteria were: a history or presence of gastrointestinal, hepatic or renal disease, or any other condition known to interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs; loose stools [Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) score of 6 or 7  23 ] for 2 or more days in the week before study drug administration; use of medications or supplements known to affect stool consistency and/or gastrointestinal motility, including fibre supplements, antidiarrhoeal agents, prokinetic drugs, enemas, probiotic medications or supplements; or salt or electrolyte supplements containing sodium, potassium, chloride or bicarbonate formulations during the week before randomization. Study treatments Following screening, all volunteers underwent two treatments in a 1: 1 randomized sequence (Figure  1 ): (i) a single oral dose of cefadroxil 500 mg administered in the morning; and (ii) tenapanor 15 mg, administered orally twice daily for 4 days, followed by single doses of both tenapanor 15 mg and cefadroxil 500 mg (administered in the morning) on day 5 (this treatment combination hereafter referred to as cefadroxil + tenapanor). There was a washout period of at least 4 days between the two treatment periods. Figure 1 Study design. Participants were admitted to the study centre on the morning of the day before study drug administration (day –1) and discharged on the last day of treatment (day 1 or day 5) following sample collection for pharmacokinetic measurements.  a At least 4 days between the last dose of the first treatment period and the first dose of the second treatment period. b.i.d., twice daily For each treatment regimen, volunteers were admitted to the study centre on the morning of the day before study drug administration (day –1). Volunteers who received cefadroxil alone were discharged on the day of treatment (day 1), after samples had been collected for pharmacokinetic measurements. Those receiving cefadroxil + tenapanor were resident at the centre until the end of sample collection on day 5. Volunteers returned to the study centre for follow‐up assessments 7–10 days after administration of the final treatment dose. Volunteers underwent an overnight fast of at least 8 h before study drug administration. Cefadroxil and tenapanor were administered 5–10 min before meals (breakfast and/or dinner), and all volunteers could consume only the same standardized meals and drinks offered during the residential period. Pharmacokinetic assessments Blood samples were collected predose and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 h postdose on day 1 of the cefadroxil treatment period and at the same time points on day 5 of the cefadroxil + tenapanor treatment period to assess the pharmacokinetics of cefadroxil. Blood samples collected predose and 1, 2 and 4 h postdose on day 5 were also used to assess plasma concentrations of tenapanor. Samples for determination of drug concentration in plasma were analysed by Covance Laboratories Inc. (Madison, WI, USA). Cefadroxil and its deuterated internal standard were isolated from plasma using protein precipitation and analysed using liquid chromatography followed by tandem mass spectrometric detection. Before being used to analyse cefadroxil levels in the study samples, the method was validated in the range 30.0–30 000 ng ml –1 . Tenapanor and its deuterated internal standard were extracted from samples using liquid–liquid extraction. After evaporation under nitrogen, the residue was reconstituted and analysed using liquid chromatography followed by tandem mass spectrometric detection. Before being used to analyse tenapanor concentrations in the samples collected, the method was validated in the range 0.500–100 ng ml –1 . Pharmacokinetic parameters were derived using standard noncompartmental methods with Phoenix WinNonlin Professional version 6.3 (Pharsight Corp., Mountain View, CA, USA). All pharmacokinetic computations were performed using either this software or SAS® version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The parameters determined were as follows: the maximum concentration in plasma ( C 
 max ); area under the concentration–time curve in plasma from time zero (predose) to time of last quantifiable concentration (AUC 0– t ), calculated by linear up/log down trapezoidal summation; area under the concentration–time curve in plasma from time zero (predose) extrapolated to infinite time (AUC), calculated by linear up/log down trapezoidal summation and extrapolated to infinity by addition of the last quantifiable concentration ( C 
 t ) divided by the apparent elimination rate constant (λ z ;  i.e.  AUC = AUC 0– t  +  C 
 t /λ z ). Pharmacodynamic assessments Stool frequency and stool consistency (as measured by the BSFS  23 ) were assessed daily on day –1 of the first treatment period and on days 1–5 of the cefadroxil + tenapanor treatment period. Assessments were over 24‐h intervals following the morning dosing, except for day 5 of cefadroxil + tenapanor treatment (12‐h interval). Safety assessments Safety assessments included vital signs (at screening, on entry to the study clinic on day –1, and at the end of each treatment period), physical examinations (at screening and at the end of the second treatment period), clinical laboratory evaluations (clinical chemistry, haematology and urinalysis: at screening, before dosing on day 1 of each treatment period, and at the end of the second treatment period), electrocardiograms (at screening and at the end of each treatment period) and adverse event (AE) monitoring (throughout the study: from screening until the follow‐up visit). Statistical analyses Pharmacokinetic assessments were summarized using descriptive statistics for all plasma measurements of cefadroxil exposure. The pharmacokinetic analysis set consisted of all volunteers who received cefadroxil 500 mg and provided evaluable pharmacokinetic profiles during either treatment period. Following natural log transformation, the observed  C 
 max , AUC and AUC 0– t  were analysed separately using a mixed effects analysis of variance model, with sequence, period and treatment as fixed effects, and volunteer nested within sequence as a random effect. The point estimate and 90% confidence interval (CI) for the difference between treatments was constructed and exponentially back‐transformed to provide point and CI estimates for the ratio of interest ([cefadroxil + tenapanor]/cefadroxil). Assuming no effect of tenapanor on the pharmacokinetics of cefadroxil and a standard deviation (SD) of 0.3 or less for the change in log‐transformed pharmacokinetic variables, a sample size of 24 volunteers was expected to provide a 90% probability of the two‐sided 90% CI for the ratio ([cefadroxil + tenapanor]/cefadroxil) being completely contained within 80–125%. The study therefore aimed to include 28 volunteers. Summary statistics were determined for pharmacodynamic evaluations of stool frequency and stool consistency. The pharmacodynamic (i.e. stool) analysis and safety analysis sets included all volunteers who received at least one dose of tenapanor or cefadroxil and had at least one postdose measurement. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4. 
 Results 
 Study participants Twenty‐eight volunteers (18 men) were enrolled in this study. All volunteers completed the study, receiving all treatments according to study protocol, and were included in pharmacokinetic and safety analyses. One participant was excluded from pharmacodynamic (stool) analysis, as only predose data were available. Mean ± SD age of the volunteers was 32 ± 10 years (range 19–49 years) and mean ± SD body mass index was 26.0 ± 2.8 kg m –2  (range 19.4–29.8 kg m –2 ). Pharmacokinetics Cefadroxil plasma concentration–time curves were similar whether cefadroxil was administered alone or in combination with tenapanor (Figure  2 ). Pharmacokinetic parameters of cefadroxil were also similar when cefadroxil was given alone or in combination with tenapanor [geometric least‐squares mean ratio (90% CI), (cefadroxil + tenapanor)/cefadroxil: AUC, 93.3 (90.6–96.0)%; AUC 0– t , 93.4 (90.7–96.1)%;  C 
 max , 95.9 (89.8–102.5)%; Table  1 ]. Median time to maximum plasma concentration was 1.5 h and the geometric mean of the apparent terminal half‐life was approximately 2 h for both cefadroxil and cefadroxil + tenapanor treatments. The plasma concentration of tenapanor was below the lower limit of quantitation (0.5 ng ml –1 ) in all samples collected and analysed during the study.

Mean ± SD BSFS scores increased from 3.7 ± 1.0 on day –1 to 5.4 ± 1.2 for the overall tenapanor dosing period. Safety and tolerability Tenapanor was generally well tolerated and no safety concerns were identified. No serious AEs or discontinuations due to AEs occurred during the study. Overall, 11 volunteers reported AEs, all of which were mild in intensity and resolved. Almost all AEs were gastrointestinal in nature. Ten volunteers reported AEs during administration of tenapanor 15 mg twice daily (days 1–4), while one volunteer reported an AE following cefadroxil + tenapanor administration (day 5). The most common AEs (reported by at least two volunteers) were abdominal distension ( n  = 4), abdominal pain ( n  = 4), abnormal gastrointestinal sounds ( n  = 3), diarrhoea ( n  = 2) and flatulence ( n  = 2). No trends or clinically relevant changes in clinical laboratory results, vital signs, electrocardiograms or physical examinations were observed during the study. 
 Discussion 
 This phase 1 study aimed to investigate whether gastrointestinal NHE3 inhibition by tenapanor has a clinically relevant impact on the transport activity of the H + ‐coupled transporter PepT1 in humans. NHE3 inhibition has been suggested to reduce H +  secretion into the gut, potentially affecting the acid microclimate and thereby reducing H + ‐coupled transporter activity  20 ,  21 . PepT1 is involved in the uptake of several drugs  14 ,  18 ,  19 , and apical dipeptide transport and uptake assays across a range of extracellular pH values suggest that the optimal transport activity of PepT1 occurs at pH 6.5, which is within the  physiological  pH range of the acid microclimate at the mucosal surface of the intestine (pH 6.1–6.8). To test whether NHE3 inhibition by tenapanor affects PepT1 transport activity, the pharmacokinetics of cefadroxil (a compound transported by PepT1) were compared when cefadroxil was administered alone and in combination with tenapanor in 28 volunteers. Our results suggest that repeated dosing with tenapanor 15 mg twice daily has no clinically relevant effect on PepT1 activity. Our study was performed in line with regulatory guidance for transporter‐based  in vivo  drug–drug interaction studies  24 ,  25 . The tenapanor dose of 15 mg twice daily is at the lower end of the range tested so far for the treatment of patients with IBS‐C or the treatment of hyperphosphataemia in patients with CKD on dialysis  7 ,  10 . Additional data may be needed to confirm whether the lack of effect on cefadroxil absorption observed in our study is also seen at higher doses of tenapanor. Tenapanor was administered for 4 days to ensure that the pharmacodynamic effects reached a steady state before administration of a therapeutically relevant dose of cefadroxil.  In vitro  studies have convincingly shown that cefadroxil has moderate affinity for, and is transported by, PepT1  19 . Furthermore, studies in knockout mice indicate that PepT1 plays a key role in the rate and extent of absorption of cefadroxil following oral administration  22 . Cefadroxil is therefore a recommended agent for studies examining the pharmaceutical relevance of H + ‐coupled peptide transporters  19 ,  26 . Pharmacological activity of tenapanor was evident owing to changes in stool consistency and frequency, consistent with NHE3 inhibition and previous findings in healthy volunteers  27 . In mouse models, deletion of the NHE3 gene results in severe impairment of sodium–fluid volume homeostasis with subsequent chronic diarrhoea  4 , and a decrease in calcium absorption  28 . However, our study showed that pharmacological inhibition of NHE3 in humans resulted in a phenotype nowhere near as extreme as that observed in NHE3 knockout mouse models. The ratios of plasma cefadroxil AUC, AUC 0– t  and  C 
 max  for cefadroxil alone and cefadroxil in combination with tenapanor were within the bioequivalence range (80–125%), indicating that there were no clinically significant differences in cefadroxil uptake between the two treatments. Other clinical studies that have investigated the effect of changes in the acid microclimate on PepT1 transport activity have shown inconsistent results  29 ,  30 . Amiloride, an inhibitor of Na + /H +  exchange, was found to decrease the gastrointestinal uptake of the β‐lactam antibiotic amoxicillin in healthy volunteers  29 . By contrast, in another study, jejunal perfusion with amiloride and amoxicillin in healthy volunteers did not affect amoxicillin absorption in the gut  30 . Our study showed no evidence of an indirect effect of tenapanor on PepT1 transport activity. This lack of effect suggests that inhibition of gastrointestinal NHE3 by tenapanor may not be sufficient to alter the pH of the acid microclimate to an extent that could significantly affect PepT1 function. Although the reported pH of the acid microclimate varies across studies and in different regions of the intestine, values for the proximal jejunum typically range from pH 6.1 to 6.8  31 ,  32 ,  33 ,  34 ,  35 .  In vitro  studies have shown that, although PepT1 activity is reduced as the pH increases, PepT1 is still active at pH 7.0  20 . It therefore seems unlikely that any increase in the pH of the acid microclimate as a consequence of tenapanor inhibition of NHE3 would be sufficient to cause complete loss of PepT1 activity. Furthermore, most H + ‐coupled transporters are spread over a large area of the intestine and are high‐capacity and low‐affinity transporters, making it difficult to inhibit the transport of any one particular compound effectively and hence difficult to create a relevant drug–drug interaction. PepT1 is considerably more abundant in the small intestine than in the colon  36 ; however, as this expression pattern is similar to that of NHE3  15 ,  16 , it seems unlikely that differences in the relative regional expression of gastrointestinal PepT1 and NHE3 account for the lack of drug–drug interaction seen here. Throughout our phase 3 programme for tenapanor we are investigating any data trends that may reflect drug–drug interactions; none have been identified to date. In conclusion, our study found that repeated dosing of tenapanor 15 mg twice daily had no clinically relevant effect on cefadroxil exposure in humans. This suggests that pharmacological inhibition of NHE3 by tenapanor is unlikely to have any clinically relevant impact on the activity of the H + ‐coupled transporter PepT1 in the gut. This may guide future research on drug–drug interactions during the development of NHE3 inhibitors.

    <Body>What is already known about this subject 
 Large interindividual variability is observed in lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (LUTS/BPH). Whereas treatment response (symptomatic improvement) can be assessed by a standardized questionnaire, the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), there is limited understanding of individual phenotypes associated with the progression of disease (symptomatic deterioration). 
 What this study adds 
 This model‐based meta‐analysis shows that individual IPSS trajectories are affected by both treatment‐related effects and disease progression rate. In addition to the identification of baseline covariates affecting IPSS trajectories, our results provide insight into the factors that explain interindividual differences in the deterioration of symptoms, allowing for the distinction of different phenotypes. It can be anticipated that the use of a model‐based algorithm may provide a basis for prediction of the disease progression rate and individual response to different interventions in patients with moderate or severe BPH symptoms. 
 1 INTRODUCTION Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is characterized by growth of both epithelial and stromal tissues in the prostate. It is common among aging males with a reported prevalence of up to 50% and 80% in the fifth and eighth decades of life, respectively.

  Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS)/BPH management is aimed at achieving two goals: (a) improving LUTS and (b) reducing the risk of disease progression (in terms of symptoms and/or complications such as acute urinary retention or surgery). Whilst it is recognized that increasing severity and progression of symptoms have a significant impact on the quality of life (QoL) of patients, it is difficult to predict the deterioration of LUTS in individuals. Among the available treatment options, conservative management (ie, education, reassurance, lifestyle advice, periodic monitoring) or interventions with drugs are frequently used in clinical practice without assessing the likelihood of LUTS deterioration for a given patient. Conservative treatment is recommended by both the American Urological Association (AUA) and the European Association of Urology guidelines for patients with mild LUTS/BPH (International Prostate Symptom Score [IPSS] &lt; 8), or moderate‐to‐severe symptoms with low QoL impairment.

  However, this strategy is less appropriate for patients with moderate or severe LUTS/BPH, at risk of disease progression or with existing complications due to bladder outlet obstruction related to BPH (ie, benign prostatic obstruction). The use of combination therapy, including an α‐blocker ( tamsulosin ) and a 5α‐reductase inhibitor ( dutasteride ), has proven to be effective for the management of these patients. Currently, this drug treatment is also available as a once‐daily fixed‐dose combination. Evidence from clinical trials shows that combination therapy significantly reduces the risk of BPH disease progression compared with monotherapy in moderate‐to‐severe patients (CombAT study), 
 5 
  and in treatment‐naïve patients with moderate symptoms compared with watchful waiting with protocol‐defined initiation of tamsulosin monotherapy in patients whose symptoms did not improve (CONDUCT study). 
 6 
 
 Traditionally, LUTS have been measured using the standardized and validated IPSS questionnaire, which captures and quantifies the severity of storage and voiding symptoms for a recall period of 4 weeks. The IPSS was developed as a screening tool combining seven symptom questions and one QoL question for fast symptom assessment to guide LUTS management in patients with LUTS/BPH. 
 7 
  The IPSS was designed to be easily and quickly self‐administered by the patient and, consequently, it can be used in both urology clinics and primary care settings. In addition to its role in the assessment of LUTS and charting of disease progression, the IPSS is effective in helping to determine treatment options for patients. Moreover, the IPSS can be used to evaluate the progression and severity of LUTS over time. In fact, the primary efficacy endpoint in most clinical trials is defined in terms of change in IPSS relative to baseline. On the other hand, mean IPSS values have been used as prognostic risk factors for disease progression regardless of ongoing or prior pharmacological treatment. This approach may not accurately predict an individual patient's treatment response because it is difficult to separate the placebo effect and the progressive nature of the disease from the actual pharmacological effect. Here we describe the methodology used to develop and evaluate a longitudinal model aimed at the characterization of the individual IPSS trajectories of patients affected by LUTS/BPH following treatment with placebo, tamsulosin, dutasteride or tamsulosin‐dutasteride combination therapy. The goal of this analysis was to identify a mathematical function that reflects progression (improvement or deterioration) of LUTS over the course of treatment, taking into account the potential effect of disease‐ or medication‐related covariate factors and any placebo effect. Analogously to epidemiological research on natural history and disease burden, the use of longitudinal models provides a parametric representation of time‐varying disease characteristics. In fact, numerous longitudinal studies of the natural time course of disease were conducted in the 1970s,

  a trend that has continued despite the challenges in obtaining information from untreated patients as new drugs have become available in numerous therapeutic indications. Consequently, the evaluation of drug effects on disease trajectory has represented an important advancement not only for clinical pharmacology, but also for drug development.

 It can be anticipated that the availability of a longitudinal model, including parameters describing inter‐ and intra‐individual variability, may allow the assessment of the impact of different treatment scenarios on LUTS and consequently the course of clinical symptoms. Such a parameterization may also unravel correlations or interactions between treatment and baseline characteristics that could be considered predictors of individual IPSS trajectories. In addition, model parameter estimates obtained from this retrospective analysis of clinical trials with varying treatment durations may be used subsequently in conjunction with clinical trial simulations to evaluate the potential benefit of early versus delayed onset of treatment with combination therapy. 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Data source The data used for this analysis were obtained from six clinical trials of dutasteride (ARIA3001, ARIA3002, ARI40002, CombAT, CONDUCT and ARIB3003) and include 140 733 clinical observations from 10 238 participants who were randomized to placebo, watchful waiting with protocol‐defined initiation of tamsulosin 0.4 mg or dutasteride 0.5 mg once‐daily monotherapy, or immediate oral tamsulosin‐dutasteride combination therapy for up to 4 years. A total of 3790 patients received dutasteride over 2 or 4 years (ARIA3001, ARIA3002, CombAT, ARIB3003) and 2143 patients received tamsulosin‐dutasteride combination therapy over 2–4 years (ARI40002, CombAT, CONDUCT). Placebo was received by 2158 participants for 2 years (ARIA3001, ARIA3002, ARIB3003). With the exception of CONDUCT, all study protocols included a placebo run‐in phase. An overview of baseline demographic characteristics, along with the actual doses, regimens and eventual deviations is shown in Table  1 , where the efficacy population is summarized along with the original treatment details in the clinical study protocols. See the Supporting Information for details on the analysis populations and preparation of the data sets used during model development and validation (Table  S1  and Figure  S1 ). A schematic diagram of different subsets of the aggregated data set is presented in Figure  1 .

Despite the discrete nature of the IPSS data, the analysis was implemented by treating IPSS as a continuous scale. Treatment effect was then parameterized in addition to the placebo intervention 
 12 
  as covariate effects on the disease progression rate (Equations 2 and 3).
 (1) d IPSS dt = DISP · 1 − IPSS 35 − PLACEBO + TREATMENT · IPSS , IPSS 0 = IPSS b 
 (2) PLACEBO = DELTA placebo · e − TIME · ln 2 T 1 2 
 (3) TREATMENT = DELTA treatment The term  dIPSS / dt  in Equation 1 represents the rate of change (ie, derivative) in IPSS. IPSS(0) indicates the initial condition for the IPSS compartment.  IPSS 
 b  represents the observed baseline disease state, whereas  DISP  represents the coefficient describing the rate of progression or degeneration of symptoms (ie, disease progression rate). The  DELTA 
 placebo  term represents the maximum rate of reduction of symptoms due to placebo intervention and  T 
 ½  is the half‐life of the effect of the placebo intervention. The term  DELTA 
 treatment  accounts for the effect of any active intervention in an additive manner to the underlying disease progression rate and placebo effect. This model parameterization provides an easier interpretation of the effect of the intervention on disease progression (ie, on the individual IPSS trajectory) as compared to a turnover or indirect response ( K 
 in  –  K 
 out ) model. In fact, similar modelling approaches used a common parameterization to describe symptomatic and disease‐modifying effects.

 For the sake of clarity, the term disease progression is used to describe the longitudinal variation in IPSS (ie, increase in severity or deterioration of symptoms). Whilst it should not be confounded with the clinical definition of disease progression, which considers other clinical parameters than IPSS, DISP does represent the rate of progression or degeneration of symptoms due to the underlying disease and as such encompasses the variation in the clinical features that determine IPSS itself. General model‐building criteria were applied to ensure that the appropriate structural model was identified to capture the changes in IPPS following the placebo treatment (Figure  S2 ). Next, the appropriate stochastic models describing between‐subject variability were identified to expand the base model. Given the heterogeneity of the profiles, a log‐normal distribution was found to best describe the variability of the model parameters. 
 15 
  Selected covariates were added to the base model according to a stepwise forward addition‐backward elimination procedure. As shown in Table  1 , the wide range of variation in baseline characteristics (eg, age, body weight [WT], prostate‐specific antigen [PSA], prostate volume) allowed for a comprehensive evaluation of influential clinical and demographic covariates on key disease‐model parameters. Given that only a single treatment level was available, the drug effect was treated as a discrete term and estimated after characterization of placebo effect on individual IPSS trajectories. All steps were implemented in NONMEM version 7.3 software (Icon Development Solutions, MD, USA) based on the FOCE‐I estimation method. Additional details on model refinement and an example of the control stream file for the final model are presented in the Supporting Information. 2.3 Simulation‐based evaluation of the effect of disease progression and treatment on individual IPSS trajectories Simulations were subsequently performed using the final model parameter estimates to assess the implications for treatment response when drugs with symptomatic and disease‐modifying properties are used in individual patients with varying disease‐progression rates. For comparison purposes, individual IPSS trajectories were generated along with the predicted profiles in the absence of any active treatment. Graphical summaries were created using the percentiles of the disease progression (DISP) parameter distribution to visualise and distinguish the contribution of different disease progression rates to the predicted IPSS response. Likewise, simulations were performed to illustrate the impact of disease state on IPSS trajectories, as defined by IPSS severity at baseline.

At screening, 61% and 39% of patients were categorized as having moderate and severe LUTS/BPH, respectively. These values were found to shift to 66% and 29% immediately prior to the start of treatment. A summary of demographics and clinical baseline characteristics, along with the studied covariates, is presented in Table  1 . 3.2 Exploratory data analysis A detailed description of the exploratory analysis and model development steps, including covariate analysis and parameterization of disease and drug‐specific properties, is presented in Figures  S3 – S5 . No outlying IPSS values were identified. No correlations or interactions were found between demographics and baseline clinical characteristics and baseline/screening IPSS, other than those due to the known co‐linearity between variables (Figure  2 ).

Such a model structure appears to explain the initial fast improvement followed by slowly progressive changes in IPSS in most patients. The treatment effect was parameterized in addition to the placebo intervention as covariate effect on the disease progression rate. Given that pharmacokinetic (PK) data were not available, and variability in pharmacokinetics may propagate into interindividual differences in pharmacodynamics, it was decided to assign random effects to the parameters describing the active treatment, while fixing the variability in the placebo effect as estimated in the previous model building step (ie, the disease progression and placebo effect model). Full details of the model building and validation are presented in Figures  S6 – S16 . For completeness, some important steps of the model development and validation procedures are highlighted in the following paragraphs. First, covariates that showed statistical significance were included in the model describing disease progression and placebo effect. These covariates were baseline IPSS (correlated with disease progression rate), duration of symptoms (correlated with magnitude of placebo effect) and alcohol user status (correlated with half‐life of the placebo effect). Despite a wide span between start and completion of treatment across the different studies, model parameterization allowed the characterization of individual and population IPSS profiles, as shown by the visual predictive checks (VPCs) stratified by treatment (Figures  3  and  S6 ). Re‐estimation of model parameters including all the available data showed that the magnitude of covariate effects may vary considerably, which reflects the differences in patient baseline characteristics across studies. Mirror plots for model diagnostics revealed no misspecification or correlations between parameters describing between‐ and within‐subject variability (Figures  S15  and  S16 ). Validation procedures also showed that the placebo effect is a key component of the initial response and can last more than 6 months, as assessed by its half‐life. Given the heterogeneity in IPSS trajectories, no clear baseline prognostic factors were identified that could be used as a single predictor of treatment response or time course of symptoms in individual patients. FIGURE 3 Visual predictive checks showing predicted and observed IPSS profiles (left panels) and examples of individual IPSS trajectories (right panels) after placebo treatment (A, B), tamsulosin (C, D), dutasteride (E, F) or tamsulosin‐dutasteride combination therapy (G,H) in patients randomly selected from the analysis population ( n  = 12 per treatment group). The proposed model parameterization allowed the description of different patterns of response. Observed data for VPCs include random sampling for patients enrolled in CombAT, ARIA3001, ARIA3002, ARIB3003, ARI40002 and CONDUCT. Red lines show model‐predicted individual profiles over a period of up to 2 years for placebo or 4 years for the other interventions. Dots are actual observations in the pooled data set. IPSS, International Prostate Symptom Score 3.3.2 Watchful waiting, tamsulosin and dutasteride monotherapy Validation procedures revealed that patients assigned to watchful waiting who respond to the intervention show an immediate improvement of the same order of magnitude as individual patients responding to tamsulosin. These changes are independent of the underlying placebo effect. Visual inspection of diagnostic measures indicated that patients with very high baseline IPSS, who do not appear to respond to any intervention, show IPSS trajectories that are less well‐described than patients who show improvement during treatment. As this potential model misspecification is limited to the upper 2.5 th  percentile of the population, discrepancies between model predictions and observed data were deemed to have no further implications for the characterization of the individual trajectories, the impact of treatment on the deterioration of symptoms and underlying disease progression for most patients. 3.3.3 Tamsulosin‐dutasteride combination therapy Given the objective of the current analysis in identifying a model parameterization, which enables the distinction between drug‐ and disease‐specific properties, it was essential to demonstrate adequate model performance in describing symptomatic effects following initial treatment with tamsulosin as well as symptomatic and disease‐modifying effects after dutasteride or combination therapy. In fact, model performance was deemed adequate for the internal and external validation data sets. Re‐estimation of model parameters using all data sets yielded robust parameter estimates with relative differences between data sets substantially &lt;30%. In addition to the standard model‐evaluation procedures, posterior predictive checks were also performed to assess model performance on secondary response parameters, such as responder rate according to the different definitions of clinical response outlined in the statistical methods. Figure  4  shows the predicted percentage of responders at 48 months after start of treatment with tamsulosin or combination therapy, along with the observed results for the corresponding study arms. The plots show very good predictions for tamsulosin and combination therapy, indicating no model bias or misspecification for the evaluation of early versus delayed onset of treatment with combination therapy. The observed response rate for dutasteride monotherapy was found to be slightly higher than mean model predictions, but within the 95% prediction intervals. This discrepancy for dutasteride monotherapy was not deemed to be a model misspecification, so it should have no impact on the objectives of the current analysis. FIGURE 4 Histograms showing the percentage of responders based on different definitions of clinical response, namely change in IPSS ≥ 25% relative to baseline (A), change in IPSS ≥ 3 units relative to baseline (B) and change in IPSS ≥25% or 3 units relative to baseline (C). The histograms display the number of simulations in each percentag prediction ( N 
 tot  = 1000). The vertical line shows the observed responder rate in the ComBAT study using the same definition applied to the simulated data. IPSS, International Prostate Symptom Score 3.3.4 Final model The final model parameter estimates and bootstrap results for the longitudinal model describing the effect on individual IPSS trajectories (disease progression) of placebo, tamsulosin, dutasteride and tamsulosin‐dutasteride combination therapy are shown in Tables  2  and  3 . Model parameters describing LUTS deterioration and disease progression reveal that individual IPSS trajectories are influenced not only by the interaction between different baseline covariates, but also by a strong initial placebo effect, which is characterized by large interindividual variability, in terms of both its magnitude and duration. It is the magnitude of the parameters describing progression ( DISP ) and amplitude ( delta ) of the symptomatic effect that ultimately determine the trajectory. While a fully mechanistic interpretation of parameters may not be possible, estimates of the effect of the combination therapy on progression of IPSS are twice the effect of tamsulosin alone (0.015  vs  0.032 months −1 ). Our results also show that for a typical patient with moderate LUTS/BPH symptoms (baseline IPSS = 17.5), interventions with symptomatic and disease‐modifying properties (eg, tamsulosin‐dutasteride combination therapy) contribute to a sustained reduction in disease progression rate and overall rate of change in IPSS with estimates that are 40% higher than the placebo effect at the start of treatment. By contrast, symptomatic interventions (eg, tamsulosin, watchful waiting) result in overall rate of change IPSS with estimates that are approximately 20% higher than the placebo effect at the start of treatment. Such an effect wanes over time together with the placebo effect. For completeness, an example of the predicted individual IPSS trajectories in patients with varying rates of disease progression after incorporation of residual variability is shown in Figure  S17 .

 4 DISCUSSION Whereas the management of LUTS/BPH has changed significantly over the last two decades in response to the availability of new treatment options, 
 3 
 ,  
 16 
 ,  
 17 
  the use of IPSS to assess LUTS/BPH and define treatment initiation as well as type still varies significantly across countries, often mirroring local clinical practice preferences and drug availability. This seems to overlook the findings from a range of epidemiologic and clinical studies that highlight the implications of disease progression in a significant proportion of BPH patients. 
 18 
 ,  
 19 
  It also reflects the lack of a clear marker or predictor of treatment response in individual patients. Our analysis focused primarily on evidence arising from controlled clinical trials, in which different interventions were used to improve LUTS, as assessed by the IPSS questionnaire. Despite numerous clinical features, its use as primary endpoint in randomized clinical trials has been limited to the assessment of mean population changes from baseline. In contrast, the current analysis shows the feasibility of a parametric approach to describe individual IPSS trajectories in patients with moderate or severe LUTS/BPH. The availability of a longitudinal model for IPSS provides the basis for evaluation of a range of clinical questions regarding the effect of different interventions on LUTS/BPH progression. It also represents an efficient approach for knowledge integration, allowing for study protocol optimization and improved patient and treatment selection. Furthermore, our analysis shows that no single baseline characteristic can be considered as the primary predictor of an individual IPSS trajectory. The interaction between different baseline characteristics only explains part of the interindividual differences in the underlying disease progression rate and placebo effect. It is the magnitude of the parameters describing progression ( DISP ) and amplitude ( delta ) of the symptomatic effect that ultimately determines the trajectory. In fact, the lack of clear correlation between baseline characteristics and IPSS at screening/baseline suggests that repeated measurements over time are required to characterize the different clinical phenotypes associated with the individual IPSS trajectory. While this analysis appears to be the very first application of longitudinal modelling in the field of urology, similar approaches have been applied in other therapeutic areas to address similar clinical and regulatory questions.

  Irrespective of differences in the methodology, the characterization of individual IPSS trajectories can be compared with previous attempts to assess the impact of treatments with disease‐modifying properties on disease progression. 
 24 
  As such, this work offered a unique opportunity to assess the impact of different interventions on the improvement/deterioration of symptoms. From a clinical perspective, the approach proposed here contrasts with traditional pivotal clinical trials in which a predefined hypothesis is tested. In conjunction with simulation scenarios, longitudinal models become inferential tools, which in turn can be used to explore a range of interventions that have either not been tested experimentally or cannot be implemented without confounding from factors that cannot be controlled in an experimental protocol. 
 25 
  Justifying the claim that a treatment shows disease‐modifying rather than symptomatic properties requires the ability to identify both types of effects, including when they occur at the same time. Whilst there is a strong pharmacological basis for the differences in the effects induced by 5α‐reductase inhibitors and α‐blockers, the analysis of longitudinal data from standard study designs suggest that the distinction between symptomatic and disease‐modifying effects may be ambiguous and not easily disentangled from each other.

  This problem highlights the challenges one may face when addressing common clinical questions, such as the long‐term implications of starting treatment with symptomatic versus disease‐modifying therapies. 4.1 Development and validation of a disease‐progression model describing IPSS trajectory First, it should be noted that we have attempted to describe IPSS profiles from the different clinical studies, with different interventions and treatment durations and protocol designs. This has created opportunities and challenges for the identification of suitable parameterization. A few key points became clear during model development and covariate analysis, in that baseline characteristics were identified as covariate factors, corroborating evidence from clinical practice (eg, effect of baseline IPSS on IPSS trajectory) and shedding light on new factors (eg, effect of alcohol use on placebo half‐life). 
 29 
  Even though different approaches have been proposed for the characterization of baseline for pharmacodynamic endpoints, observed baseline IPSS was used, taking into account the prospective application of the model for new patients. Another important feature of this analysis was the possibility to describe the magnitude and duration of the placebo effect, which coexists with underlying disease progression, as assessed by IPSS. This finding indicates that trials of longer than 2 years may be required to discriminate placebo effects from drug‐specific effects on the progression of IPSS. 
 30 
  Despite the high variability in the parameters governing the placebo effect, there is no reason to assume that such variation is caused by protocol procedures or other extrinsic factors. They reflect the heterogeneity in the population. In addition, it is worth mentioning that such a variation in symptoms occurs within a timescale during which prostate volume is unlikely to vary significantly. For clarity, observations at screening were excluded under the assumption that the variation in IPSS prior to baseline visit reflects regression to the mean, rather than a placebo effect. Given the relative heterogeneity in the cohorts of patients, it also became evident that there is no single covariate factor at the onset of treatment that can be used as a proxy or predictive marker of individual treatment response. Therefore, it is not possible to anticipate which patients will cease to respond over time (ie, deterioration of IPSS) even if one takes into account prognostic factors of the progression of the disease. In fact, our analysis reveals that several factors or baseline characteristics shown in clinical trials to be associated with risk of progression of disease, such as prostate volume and serum PSA concentration, 
 31 
 ,  
 32 
  are not predictive of individual treatment response. These findings are consistent with the view that many prognostic factors are not necessarily good predictors of individual treatment response (ie, have poor predictive value). 
 33 
 ,  
 34 
 ,  
 35 
  Therefore, before including biomarkers or clinical characteristics in guidelines to select patients for specific treatments, it is important that clinically relevant endpoints are evaluated and the prognostic effects of these factors are distinguished from their ability to predict a differential clinical benefit from the specific treatment. 
 34 
 
 IFrom a methodological viewpoint, population mean response and 90% prediction intervals revealed acceptable predictive performance in the target patient population (ie, patients with moderate or severe LUTS/BPH who show improvement during the course of treatment). Furthermore, despite large intra‐individual variability, simulated profiles mirror clinical observations across the different studies for the vast majority of patients, indicating a well‐defined variance–covariance structure. In addition, this meta‐analysis has shed light on the magnitude of intra‐individual variability in IPSS trajectories, which is often overlooked when comparisons are made based on change from baseline at the end of a study or treatment period. Even though residual variability was found to contribute to intra‐individual variation in IPSS scores with a standard deviation of 3.2 units, interindividual differences could be identified in disease‐specific parameters; namely, the underlying disease progression rate, the placebo effect and half‐life of the placebo effect. There are limitations to the model, which are not unexpected. First, given the absence of pharmacokinetic data and the very long elimination half‐life of dutasteride (3–5 weeks), interindividual variability in exposure has been assumed to have negligible effect on disease‐specific parameters. In turn, this has made the application of the model easier and allowed a more straightforward interpretation of differences in parameter estimates. We also acknowledge that the selection of a log‐normal distribution to describe interindividual variability is empirical. Exploratory data analysis did not show supporting evidence for multimodal distributions (ie, mixture model). In addition, as interoccasion variability could not be identified, residual variability estimates were considerably high, but this appears to be an intrinsic feature of IPSS, which shows high intrasubject variability. Lastly, a balance had to be found between goodness of fit and overparameterization. Some discrepancy has been identified between observed data and mean predictions at the start of treatment and in patients around the 97.5 th  percentile. While a formal evaluation of the sensitivity and specificity of the model has not been performed yet, we aim to establish the positive or negative predictive performance of the model with regard to each patient's trajectory and final response at the end of treatment in a subsequent simulation study. Such an analysis will provide further insight into the implications of potential model misspecification. 4.2 Impact of disease progression rate and baseline symptom severity on individual IPSS trajectories Initially, simulations were performed to illustrate the effect of varying disease‐progression rates on individual IPSS trajectories when patients are treated with drugs that show both symptomatic and disease‐modifying properties (Figure  5 ). The predicted profiles for the different percentiles of the disease progression ( DISP ) parameter distribution clearly indicate that the resulting treatment response depends on the underlying progression rate. The interaction between disease progression rate, placebo and drug effects can be further characterized by the net change from baseline (Δ IPSS ) over time. In addition, the impact of disease state, as defined by IPSS severity at baseline on individual IPSS trajectories, was simulated in the absence of treatment and after administration of combination therapy with tamsulosin and dutasteride (Figure  6 ). These profiles demonstrate that baseline IPSS and disease‐progression rates interact with treatment effect, making it difficult to disentangle the contribution of each factor to response, which in a typical clinical trial is often defined in terms of relative change from baseline. For completeness, a comparison of the effect of symptomatic (tamsulosin monotherapy) and symptomatic as well as disease‐modifying properties (tamsulosin‐dutasteride combination therapy, lower panel) on individual IPSS trajectories in patients with varying rates of disease progression and varying symptom severity at baseline is shown in Figure  7 . Lastly, it should be noted that in a typical clinical trial setting, appraisal of the disease progression rate and its impact on the overall treatment response is confounded by residual variability in IPSS. The relevance of model‐based characterization of individual IPSS trajectories is emphasized in Figure  S17 , where measurement noise is included in the simulated profiles. These results may also explain why no predefined set of baseline characteristics has been identified as a sufficiently sensitive marker of the deterioration of symptoms or treatment response. In fact, in a recent data‐mining exercise including men with LUTS secondary to BPH, it was shown that baseline IPSS severity achieved sensitivity and specificity of 70% and ~50%, respectively, as predictors of individual response to placebo or tadalafil. 
 4 
  However, these values are below the sensitivity and specificity threshold of 80% that enables reliable allocation of an individual patient to either the responder or nonresponder group. 
 4 
  Hence, clinicians may not be able to accurately predict whether a patient will respond to symptomatic and disease‐modifying interventions at the start of treatment. IIn conclusion, a longitudinal drug‐disease model was developed using pooled data from clinical trials, which allows for the characterization of individual IPSS trajectories. In contrast to traditional clinical trials, where efficacy is defined in terms of relative changes from baseline at completion of treatment, our approach allowed the identification of factors, and possible placebo effect, that contribute to the progression of symptoms. Most importantly, the model yielded individual response profiles, which are exchangeable with observed patient data. Our analysis also unravelled interactions between placebo treatment and baseline characteristics that had not been identified in previous studies. These covariates affect individual IPSS trajectories and contribute to differences in response to treatment. It can be anticipated that the availability of this model, including parameters describing inter‐ and intra‐individual variability, will provide insight into the impact of different treatment conditions on the progression of clinical symptoms.

    <Body>1 What is already known about this subject 
 Metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors, particularly mGlu 2  and mGlu 3  receptors have been of interest for the development of a novel intervention for schizophrenia due to their distribution within cortical and limbic areas, and their modulatory roles in glutamatergic transmission. MGS0008, the active form of MGS0274 besylate (TS‐134) is a potent and selective agonist of mGlu 2  and mGlu 3  receptors, and has been shown to possess antipsychotic‐like activity in some animal models. 
 What this study adds 
 These first‐in‐human, single and multiple ascending dose studies assessed the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of MGS0274 besylate (TS‐134), a novel prodrug of mGlu 2/3  receptor agonist, administered orally in healthy subjects. The favourable safety profile of TS‐134, and exposure of its active compound, MGS0008, observed in both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid from current studies, support further evaluation of TS‐134 in a proof‐of‐concept study in patients with schizophrenia. 
 2 INTRODUCTION 
 Glutamate  is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, and its dysfunction plays an important role in aetiology and pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. 
 1 
 ,  
 2 
  Increased pyramidal neuron activity in the prefrontal cortex due to hypofunction of  N ‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA ) receptor on the  γ‐aminobutyric acid  interneurons was noted in schizophrenic patients, 
 3 
 ,  
 4 
  and the NMDA receptor antagonists cause schizophrenia‐like symptoms in healthy volunteers, and worsen psychosis in schizophrenic patients. 
 5 
 ,  
 6 
  Thus, glutamatergic dysfunction, in particular the hypofunction of the NMDA receptor, has an important role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, and the glutamatergic system is an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of schizophrenia. 
 7 
 ,  
 8 
 
 Among glutamate receptors,  metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors , which consist of 8 subtypes, 
 9 
  have emerged as attractive therapeutic targets, and both  mGlu 2  and  mGlu 3  receptors are of particular interest for the development of a novel intervention for schizophrenia because of their distribution within cortical and limbic areas, and their modulatory roles in glutamatergic transmission. 
 8 
 ,

 ,  
 11 
  Indeed, mGlu 2/3  receptor agonists presynaptically reduce excess glutamate release induced by blockade of NMDA receptor in the medial prefrontal cortex, 
 12 
 ,  
 13 
  and thereby normalize an NMDA receptor antagonist‐induced aberrant activity in the region. 
 14 
  Moreover, mGlu 2/3  receptor agonists ameliorate abnormal behaviours in animal models which evaluate antipsychotic‐like potential of compounds. 
 15 
 ,  
 16 
 ,  
 17 
  Despite seemingly promising effects in animal models, clinical results of an mGlu 2/3  receptor agonist prodrug, pomaglumetad, after an exciting outcome in the first trial, 
 18 
  were not necessarily encouraging in subsequent trials. 
 19 
 ,  
 20 
 ,  
 21 
  However, exploratory analysis of 5 placebo‐controlled trials with pomaglumetad revealed that patients who are early‐in‐disease or previously treated with  dopamine D 2  receptor  dominant drugs exhibited significantly greater improvement relative to those receiving placebo. 
 22 
  Moreover, imaging studies raised the concerns that doses used in the trials may not have been appropriate. 
 23 
  Therefore, the potential for mGlu 2/3  receptor agonists to be novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of schizophrenia needs to be further explored. (1S,2S,3S,5R,6S)‐2‐amino‐3‐fluorobicyclo[3.1.0]hexane‐2,6‐dicarboxylic acid (MGS0008) is a potent and selective orthosteric mGlu 2/3  receptor agonist which has been demonstrated to exert antipsychotic‐like effects in animal models. 
 24 
 ,  
 25 
  Recently, we synthesized an ester‐based lipophilic prodrug of MGS0008, (1S,2S,3S,5R,6S)‐2‐amino‐3‐ fluoro‐6‐({(1S)‐1‐[({[(1R,2S,5R)‐5‐methyl‐2‐(propan‐2‐yl)cyclohexyl]oxy}carbonyl)oxy]ethoxy}carbonyl)bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane‐2‐carboxylic acid monobenzenesulfonate (MGS0274 besylate), and demonstrated that the prodrug was rapidly converted into MGS0008 in monkeys after oral administration, and that the hydrolytic activity against MGS0274 in the human liver S9 fraction was comparable to that in monkeys, suggesting the possibility of the rapid presystemic hydrolysis of MGS0274 to MGS0008 in humans. 
 26 
  Moreover, MGS0008 was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in rats after oral administration of MGS0008.

  Collectively, MGS0274 besylate is an appropriate tool to be used for the proof‐of‐concept study in human subjects. Here we report safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of single and multiple doses of TS‐134, of which MGS0274 besylate is the active ingredient, in healthy subjects, as well as preclinical data, to show pharmacological profiles of MGS0008. 3 METHODS 3.1 Preclinical pharmacology studies of MGS0008 and nomenclature of mGlu 2/3  receptor We previously reported in vitro and in vivo characteristics of MGS0008.

  In the present study, we further investigated the pharmacological profiles of MGS0008, including the effects of MGS0008 on abnormal activity induced by hypofunction of NMDA receptor. Objectives and methods for preclinical pharmacology studies are described in Supporting Information: Materials and Methods. Nomenclature of mGlu 2  and mGlu 3  receptors was conformed to the IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY nomenclature classification.

 3.2 Clinical study designs Two Phase 1 studies, a single‐ascending dose (SAD) study and a multiple‐ascending dose titration (MAD) study, employed randomized, double‐blind (subject, investigator and sponsor), placebo‐controlled, ascending dose designs. Both studies were conducted at a single site in the USA from August 2015 to December 2016. The studies were approved by the Institutional Review Board (IntegReview, Austin, TX, USA) and were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Council on Harmonisation Guideline for Good Clinical Practice. All subjects provided written informed consent before participating in the study. The SAD study was a first‐in‐human study consisting of 4 cohorts in 3 parts (Parts A [Cohorts 1 and 2], B [Cohort 7] and C [Cohort 8]; Figure 1A). In Parts A and C, subjects were randomized to receive either TS‐134 or placebo in a 3:1 ratio in each cohort (6 active and 2 placebo per cohort). In Part A, Cohort 1 initiated with 5 mg TS‐134. Subjects were dosed orally in a fasted condition except for Cohort 2 (20 mg TS‐134), which was first dosed in a fasted condition and then in a fed condition in a single crossover design. In Cohort 2, treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of vomiting and nausea led to early termination of subjects, which limited further dose escalations in Part A, and the planned Cohorts 3–6 were not conducted. Part C was then conducted to examine the tolerability of a dose level of 10 mg TS‐134, and to additionally evaluate the food effect on TS‐134 PK. Part B (CSF cohort) was conducted with a dose level of 10 mg TS‐134, in a fed condition, which was determined following a blinded interim review of safety and PK data from Parts A and C. No subjects received placebo in Part B. The MAD study evaluated the safety, tolerability and PK of 6 dose levels of TS‐134 (5, 10, 20, 40, 60 and 80 mg), administered orally and daily under a fed condition, according to specific 14‐day multiple dose titration schemes in 6 cohorts (Figure  1B ). Each cohort included a titration period (TP) and a maintenance period (MP). TS‐134 dose levels were titrated up during TP until reaching the target dose level and then the respective dose level was maintained during MP. Subjects were randomized to receive either TS‐134 or placebo in a 4:1 ratio in each cohort. Each cohort included 10 subjects (8 active and 2 placebo), except for Cohort 6, which included 9 subjects (7 active and 2 placebo). FIGURE 1 Study designs: (A) single‐ascending dose study; (B) multiple‐ascending dose study. Note (B): titration period presented without shading and maintenance period with shading 3.3 Subjects Eligible subjects included healthy males and females who were not pregnant or breastfeeding, aged 18–55 years inclusive and body weight ≥ 45 kg, with a body mass index ≥18 and ≤ 30 kg m −2 . Exclusion criteria included, but were not limited to: clinically significant abnormal cardiac examinations, haematology, biochemistry or urinalysis; significant history or presence of hepatic, renal, cardiovascular or pulmonary disease; history or presence of psychiatric or neurological disease or condition. TS‐134 and placebo were administered orally as a solution on Day 1 in the SAD study and on Day 1 through Day 14 in the MAD study. TS‐134 drug product (MGS0274 besylate) and placebo solutions were prepared extemporaneously at the clinical site by an unblinded pharmacist. The dosages were calculated as free base (MGS0274). Subjects remained on site from Day −1 until 48 hours following the last drug administration. 3.4 Blood, CSF and urine sampling In the SAD study, blood samples for the determination of MGS0274 and MGS0008 concentrations in plasma were collected at predose, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours postdose. For the CSF sample collection, an indwelling epidural catheter was inserted into the lumbar spine at least 1 hour predose. CSF was collected at predose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours postdose. Urine samples were collected at predose, and 0–6, 6–12, 12–24, 24–36 and 36–48 hours postdose. In the MAD study, Cohort 1 blood samples were collected intensively on the first and last days of TP and MP (Days 1, 7, 8, 14: predose, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 12 hours postdose), predose only on Days 2–6 and Days 9–13, and at 24, 36 and 48 hours after the final dose on Day 14. Blood sample collection times in Cohorts 2 to 6 were similar to Cohort 1, except there were no intense samplings during TP and only predose samples were collected. Urine samples were collected for 0–24 hours postdose on Days 1, 7, 8, and 14 in Cohort 1, or MP Day 1 and Day 14 in Cohorts 2 to 6, with additional samples at 24–48 hours postdose on Day 14. 3.5 Bioanalytical methods Plasma, urine and CSF samples were analysed at CMIC Pharma Science Co., Ltd. (Hyogo, Japan). The samples were quantified for MGS0274 and MGS0008 in plasma and urine, and for MGS0008 in CSF, using validated high‐performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry methods. The lower limit of quantitation was 0.1 ng mL −1  and the upper limit of quantitation (ULOQ) was 100 ng mL −1  for both MGS0008 and MGS0274 in the plasma and CSF samples. In the urine samples, the lower limit of quantitation was 1 ng mL −1  and the ULOQ was 1000 ng mL −1  for both MGS0008 and MGS0274. Samples for which the concentrations could potentially exceed the ULOQ, or for which the assayed values exceeded the ULOQ, were diluted to yield concentrations within the calibration range. All the analytical runs met the acceptance criteria: the accuracy for quality control samples ranged from 90.4 to 106.1% (plasma), 89.4 to 103.3% (urine) and 95.3 to 102.0% (CSF) for MGS0008, and 86.4 to 114.5% (plasma) and 92.4 to 111.7% (urine) for MGS0274. 3.6 Statistics Placebo treated subjects from different cohorts were pooled as control groups by condition (fasted or fed) for the SAD study and as 1 control group for the MAD study in summary statistics. 3.6.1 Sample size The sample sizes for both studies were customary for Phase 1 studies evaluating safety and PK and were not based on statistical power calculations. 3.6.2 PK PK parameters were calculated by noncompartmental analysis methods from the concentration–time data using Phoenix WinNonlin version 6.3 or later. Dose proportionality and food effects were analysed using SAS version 9.2 or later. Dose proportionality of plasma MGS0274 and MGS0008 PK variables C max  and AUC (0‐tau)  over the dose range tested in the MAD study were investigated using the following power model: log (Parameter) = a + b * log (dose), where a is the intercept and b is the slope. Linearity was assessed based on a 90% confidence interval (CI) of the slope, and those that included 1.0 were interpreted as the absence of significant evidence of nonproportionality. The food effect was evaluated in Cohorts 2 and 8 in the SAD study by performing an analysis of variance, with terms for treatment effects, on the log‐transformed values of C max  and AUC (0‐inf) . Subject was treated as a random effect and treatment was considered as a fixed effect. From these analyses, least‐squares (LS) means, LS treatment differences and 90% CI for the treatment differences on log‐scale were obtained. The results were transformed back to the original scale by exponentiation to provide treatment geometric LS means, point estimates of the geometric test (fed)/reference (fasted) LS mean ratios and 90% CI for these ratios. 3.7 Nomenclature of targets and ligands Key protein targets and ligands in this article are hyperlinked to corresponding entries in  http://www.guidetopharmacology.org , the common portal for data from the IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY. 4 RESULTS 4.1 Preclinical pharmacology profiles of MGS0008 The present study demonstrated that MGS0008 normalizes aberrant brain activity induced by hypofunction of NMDA receptor because it attenuated memantine‐increased 2‐deoxy‐D‐glucose uptake (measured as 2‐deoxyglucose 6‐phosphate formed in the cells) in the prefrontal cortex in mice (Figure  2A ). Accordingly, MGS0008 significantly attenuated not only methamphetamine‐ but also phencyclidine‐induced locomotor hyperactivity, and significantly reversed MK‐801‐induced impaired social memory in rats (Figures  2B ,  C  and  D ), indicating that MGS0008 attenuates behavioural abnormalities induced by NMDA receptor blockade. Notably, MGS0008 also significantly reduced spontaneous locomotor activity in rats at doses similar to those which block psychostimulants‐induced hyperlocomotion (Figure  S1a ). In contrast, MGS0008 did not induce catalepsy in rats, even at doses 3–10 times higher than those showing the antipsychotic‐like effects (Figure  S1b ), suggesting that MGS0008 may be devoid of extrapyramidal side effects.

Two fasted subjects (20 mg TS‐134) were discontinued due to TEAEs of severe vomiting and/or severe nausea. In the MAD study, 59 subjects were enrolled (47 active and 12 placebo) in 6 treatment cohorts. Forty‐four subjects who were administered TS‐134 and 12 who were administered placebo completed the study per protocol. There were no discontinuations due to TEAEs. Subject disposition and demographics are summarized in Tables  1  and  2 , respectively.

There were no deaths or serious adverse events in both studies. The summary of TEAEs by treatment (SAD study) and by cohort (MAD study) is presented in Table  3 . There were no apparent treatment‐ or dose‐related trends in clinical laboratory test results, vital sign measurements, 12‐lead electrocardiography measurements or physical examination findings.

In the SAD study, the most frequent TEAEs reported in Parts A and C included vomiting (31.6%) and nausea (21.1%) in fasted conditions, and nausea (25.0%) and headache (25.0%) in fed conditions. There were dose‐related increases in the incidences of vomiting and nausea. For food effect cohorts, there were no apparent differences in the incidences of TEAEs between fasted and fed conditions, except for vomiting, which was decreased under fed conditions. In Part B, during fed 10 mg TS‐134 treatment, the most frequent TEAEs included post lumbar puncture syndrome (37.5%), vomiting (25.0%), headache (25.0%) and somnolence (25.0%). All TEAEs were considered to be mild or moderate in severity; except for 2 reports of severe vomiting and 1 report of severe nausea at 20 mg in the fasted treatment group (one subject experienced both severe vomiting and severe nausea). In the MAD study, the most frequent TEAEs in the total TS‐134 group included headache (34.0%), nausea (31.9%), somnolence (19.1%) and dizziness (17.0%). All TEAEs were considered to be mild or moderate in severity, except for 1 report of severe fatigue and 1 report of severe anxiety, both of which were reported by the same subject at the 80 mg MP in Cohort 5 (data not shown). Unlike the SAD study, where TEAEs resulted in early termination of 2 subjects, there were no TEAEs leading to subject withdrawal in the MAD study. Employment of the multiple‐dose titration schemes starting from 5 or 10 mg under fed conditions improved the tolerability of TS‐134 administered orally in healthy subjects from 10 to 80 mg. 4.4 PK Mean plasma concentration–time profiles of MGS0008 and MGS0274 on Day 1 in the SAD study (fasted condition) and on Day 14 in the MAD study (fed condition) are presented in Figure  3 . The PK parameters and urinary excretion data are shown in Tables  4  and  5 , respectively. In both studies, MGS0274 was rapidly absorbed, reached C max  within 1 hour postdose and then rapidly decreased. Plasma MGS0008 (molecular weight: 203.17) was detected at the first sampling time point (15 min postdose), reached a C max  approximately 6‐fold higher than that of MGS0274 (molecular weight: 429.49) in a molar ratio within 4 hours postdose and decreased slower than MGS0274, with a t 1/2  of around 10 hours (range: 6.9–10.9 h). In the MAD study, plasma trough concentrations of MGS0008 appeared to reach steady state by 2 days after initiating multiple doses of target dose levels (data not shown), and dose proportional increases of steady‐state C max  and AUC of both MGS0274 and MGS0008 were observed over the dose range tested (5–80 mg; Table  S1 ). The plasma AUC of MGS0008 was approximately 30‐fold higher than that of MGS0274 in a molar ratio in all the treatment groups with or without food. These results demonstrated rapid and sufficient conversion of MGS0274 into MGS0008 in humans. In the SAD study, food effects on the PK of MGS0008 and MGS0274 were investigated at 10 and 20 mg TS‐134, and the C max  and AUC of MGS0008 were reduced by up to 57 and 25%, respectively, in the fed group. The C max  of MGS0274 was reduced up to 45% in the fed group, while almost no food effect was observed in AUC of MGS0274 (Table  S2 ).

Cohort 6. In the SAD study at 10 mg TS‐134, the CSF concentration of MGS0008 which is proposed to be a surrogate for a concentration in brain interstitial fluid contributing to actions on the mGlu 2/3  receptors, showed gradual increase, reaching a C max  of 1.244 ng mL −1  (coefficient of variation: 38.4%) at 8 hours postdose, and then decreased slower than from plasma, with a t 1/2  of 16.33 hours (Figure  4  and Table  4 ). The CSF‐to‐plasma exposure ratios of MGS0008 were calculated to be 3.66% (C max ) and 4.94% (AUC), respectively, which is higher than the CSF‐to‐plasma AUC ratio observed in rats (2.8%).

Figure is presented as the mean ± standard deviation In the SAD and MAD studies, the urinary excretion rate of MGS0008 ranged from 29.38 to 69.01% of the administered doses across the dose range of 5–80 mg (Table  5 ), while the urinary excretion rate of MGS0274 was around 1% of the administered doses (data not shown). The renal clearance of MGS0008 ranged from 4.238–6.180 L h −1 , which was approximately equal to or less than the human glomerular filtration rate (5.88–7.86 L h −1 ), 
 28 
  suggesting that renal MGS0008 elimination is less likely to be by tubular secretion or reabsorption in humans. 5 DISCUSSION In this Phase 1 study, we demonstrate that (i) TS‐134 is orally bioavailable in healthy subjects and is converted rapidly and extensively into the active compound (MGS0008) after oral administration; (ii) MGS0008 exhibits good CSF penetration to exert its effect; and (iii) TS‐134 is safe and generally well‐tolerated. These results support that TS‐134 can be an excellent tool to explore therapeutic values in patients in which the hyperglutamatergic state is involved, such as schizophrenia. We previously reported that MGS0008 is a potent and selective agonist for mGlu 2/3  receptor. 
 24 
  In the present preclinical study, we first confirmed if MGS0008 improves hyperactivity of the frontal cortex which has been considered as a pathophysiological feature of schizophrenia, 
 3 
 ,  
 4 
  and then we extended therapeutic profiles of MGS0008 for schizophrenia in rodent models. Our preclinical studies indicated that MGS0008 ameliorates abnormalities of the frontal cortical activity caused by NMDA receptor hypofunction in mice. Moreover, our studies showed that MGS0008 exerts antipsychotic‐like effects and improves cognitive impairment in rats at doses that normalize the frontal cortical abnormalities. Thus, MGS0008 exerts the effects by normalizing abnormal activity in the frontal cortex caused by NMDA receptor hypofunction, the pathophysiological conditions mimicking schizophrenia. MGS0008 is a rigid glutamate analogue and was predicted to exhibit poor oral bioavailability in humans due to its highly hydrophilic property, like other orthosteric mGlu 2/3  receptor agonists such as LY354740 and LY404039. 
 18 
 ,  
 29 
  Eli Lilly previously designed amino acid prodrugs to be absorbed via intestinal peptide transporter 1 for two mGlu 2/3  receptor agonists (LY544344 for LY354740, and LY2140023 for LY404039), 
 18 
 ,  
 29 
  and both prodrugs did indeed improve oral bioavailability of their active compounds in humans. However, as to LY2140023, the plasma exposure of the prodrug was found to be approximately 30% of that of LY404039. 
 18 
  Since higher exposure of prodrugs causes insufficient exposure of active compounds and might trigger unexpected toxic effects, we synthesized MGS0274 besylate, an ester‐based lipophilic prodrug, not only to achieve good gastrointestinal absorption but also to further reduce the systemic exposure to the prodrug itself in humans. 
 26 
 
 In this study, we confirmed that MGS0274 is rapidly absorbed and extensively converted into MGS0008 after dosing of TS‐134 in humans, and that the C max  and AUC of MGS0008 at steady state increased dose‐proportionally over the dose range tested (5–80 mg). The plasma exposure (AUC) of MGS0274 after single and multiple oral administrations of TS‐134 was much lower than that of MGS0008 in all the treatment groups, approximately 3% of MGS0008 AUC in a molar ratio; that is, almost all the systemic exposure can be accounted for by MGS0008. Note that comparison of exposure was made based on molar concentrations of MGS0008 and MGS0274, of which molecular weights are 203.17 and 429.49, respectively. The urinary excretion of MGS0008 was ranging from 29.38–69.01% of the administered dose without relation to the dose and dosing days (1% for MGS0274), demonstrating that gastrointestinal absorption rate of the prodrug was approximately ≥30%. These results showed that MGS0274 besylate has a desirable characteristic as a prodrug, that is, it is orally well‐absorbed and hydrolysed rapidly and sufficiently to MGS0008. Notably, our prodrug strategy is better than that used for another mGlu 2/3  receptor agonist, LY2140023, in terms of avoiding unnecessary exposure of prodrug to patients. For reference, plasma levels of LY2979165, an amino acid prodrug of the mGlu 2  receptor‐preferring agonist LY2812223, 
 30 
  were reported to be &lt;1% of its active compound. 
 31 
 
 The mean CSF C max  of MGS0008 after administration of 10 mg TS‐134 under fed condition was 1.244 ng mL −1  (6.12 nM), which is approximately 1/5 of the in vitro EC 50  value for mGlu 2  receptor (29.4 nM) and 1/7 of that of mGlu 3  receptor (45.4 nM). 
 24 
  Due to lack of an appropriate tracer for positron emission tomography to determine receptor occupancy, the concentration of the active compound in the CSF would give important information for dose determination for mGlu 2/3  receptor agonists. Indeed, it has been presumed that CSF exposure achieving the EC 50  value for the mGlu 2  receptor would be needed to exert their effects in the case of LY544344 for generalized anxiety disorder 
 32 
  and LY2140023 for schizophrenia. 
 18 
  Considering that the EC 50  value was higher in our assay system (EC 50  of LY354740 for mGlu 2  receptor is 18.3 nM) 
 24 
  than that used by Eli Lilly (EC 50  of LY354740 is 5.1 nM), 
 33 
  CSF exposure estimated in this study may approximate the EC 50  value of MGS0008 for the mGlu 2  receptor, which may achieve sufficient activation of the mGlu 2/3  receptor in the brain. Notably, although CSF concentrations of MGS0008 were measured only at the 10‐mg dose level in humans, the dose‐proportional increase in CSF exposure of MGS0008 was confirmed in rats within the plasma MGS0008 exposure levels that were observed in this clinical study (data not shown); therefore, MGS0008 CSF concentrations in humans are also expected to be dose proportional. In the SAD study, the most significant and frequent TEAEs limiting the tolerability of oral administrations of TS‐134 under fasted conditions were vomiting and nausea. Tolerability of a single dose TS‐134 solution was observed up to 10 mg. In the 14‐day MAD study, the tolerability was observed up to 80 mg by employing the multiple dose titration schemes under fed conditions, and the incidence of vomiting in the total TS‐134 group decreased from 31.6% (SAD, Parts A and C, fasted) to 6.4% (MAD). It is important to note that all vomiting and nausea in the MAD study were mild in intensity and there was no apparent dose‐related increase in these TEAEs as was seen in the SAD study. The mechanism of vomiting and nausea that occurred with TS‐134 is currently not clear. Overcoming TEAEs related to initial exposure to the drug seem to be the key to improve tolerance of TS‐134, as the dose increases by titrations in the MAD study showed no dose‐dependent increases in incidents of nausea and vomiting, even when titrated up to 80 mg. The results of these studies showed that implementation of careful titration schemes and dose administrations under fed conditions allow better management of vomiting and nausea; thus, improving the tolerability profile of TS‐134. In conclusion, oral administrations of TS‐134, prodrug MGS0274 besylate, up to 10 mg as single dose under fasted conditions and up to 80 mg as multiple dose titration under fed conditions were safe and well‐tolerated. Oral administration of TS‐134 in these studies proved a successful prodrug strategy in humans, where the prodrug, MGS0274, was rapidly converted into its active compound, MGS0008, which in turn showed good CSF penetration to act on presumed drug targets.

    <Abstact>Regulating drugs does not end when market access has been granted. Monitoring drugs over the life cycle has become state of the art, inherent to evolving legislation and societal need. Here, we explore how the drug label could move along in a changing playing‐field and become a sustainable label for the future. A dialogue between academia, government, the pharmaceutical industry and patient/societal organizations was organized by the Regulatory Science Network Netherlands. This is their view.</Abstact>
    <Body>What is already known about this subject 
 The drug label is part of the market authorization. The label is perceived as a  contract  between the marketing authorization holder and regulatory authorities. Other parties are usually not involved in the process of drafting the label 
 What this study adds 
 A multistakeholder view on how the label could improve over the drug life‐cycle. An innovative approach to enable effectiveness data become part of the label. Defined conditions for shared responsibility that need legal and regulatory consideration. 
 1 THE LABEL IN CURRENT PRACTICE Drug labels reflect the outcome of the assessment of drug dossiers, as submitted by the applicant at the time of marketing authorization. They are the result of elaborate dialogue between applicant and regulator. One could view the regulatory process as a funnel: from a rich and vast amount of data emerges a clear and relatively succinct mandate to produce, sell and use a pharmaceutical product, within the framework of continuous monitoring and benefit–risk assessment. The conditions for use are laid down in the drug label, in Europe called the summary of product characteristics (SmPC). This convergence of information that leads to the label also has a downside: the process of establishing the label is rather exclusive in terms of the type and number of stakeholders involved. Moreover, scope and clinical relevance remain limited, as well as the level of adaptiveness, or responsiveness to emerging knowledge, over time. To investigate these challenges and come up with suggestions to make the drug label  future‐proof , we organized an open dialogue within the framework of the Regulatory Science Network Netherlands (RSNN; Box  5 ), with experts covering a wide array of stakeholders, i.e. companies ( n  = 52%), regulatory agencies (29%), universities (12.5%) and patient/societal organizations (6%). The total number of participants was 56. Three issues were raised. First, we started exploring the stakeholder(s) responsible for constructing the SmPC: the applicant (usually a [bio]pharmaceutical company) and the regulator. From the perspective of the pharmaceutical industry, the responsibility for transposing reliable, high quality data into the label is with the applicant, i.e. the owner of the drug dossier, and liability issues are strongly related to the assessment, and ultimately granting of a marketing authorization. Marketing authorization has an economic value to the company and leaves little space for others to be involved. It is important to note that the label reflects the outcome of the assessment procedure at the time of marketing authorization, as performed by another stakeholder—the regulator. It provides information about the safety, efficacy  and  uncertainties of a medicinal product in the treatment of a specific condition. Therefore, one could say that companies and regulators share a mutual responsibility for the label, because it is the result of a shared and interactive process. In reality, this means that the label signifies the conditions for the competent authority, or even the European Commission, to allow the company (or marketing authorization holder, MAH) to place the product on the market. This is essentially very restrictive in nature, and, as far as the law is concerned, other stakeholders have a rather limited, or no, involvement. Even though the wording of the label, and in particular the indication, is an extensive back and forth between the regulator and the applicant, and a compromise at the time of market authorization, regulatory authorities cannot add, for instance, an indication to a label. Therefore, we consider the MAH in practice the principal responsible stakeholder. 
 BOX 1 The Regulatory Science Network Netherlands (RSNN) explained 
 WHAT IS THE RSNN 
 The RSNN, a network for experts from academia, government, the pharmaceutical industry, patient organizations and others involved in regulatory activities related to drug development, aims to facilitate activities in the field of regulatory science in the Netherlands by stimulating dialogue and collaboration, and sharing information and methods. The RSNN is aligned with other European platforms active in the field. The RSNN Newsletter informs participants and stakeholders of activities and developments in the discipline ( https://www.lygature.org/regulatory‐science‐network‐netherlands‐rsnn ). 
 Second, we discussed the value of labels during the clinical application of medicines. Apparently, this value is not always immediately recognised by patients and consumers. They indicated a gap between the information in the label and the patient's needs. Questions that any patient may have are not always answered adequately by the information in the label (or its derivative, the patient information leaflet). It does not provide, for instance, information about treatment choice, or the use of a product in treatment regimens, as can be found in professional guidelines. This raises the question of whether the label is suited to act as a clinical guidance document. One could also see the benefits of broadening the applicability of the label beyond detailing the conditions for obtaining a marketing authorization. As explained, the label is, legally, not intended as medical guideline, but may be used by health professionals as a source of information, e.g. to update clinical treatment guidelines. However, this does not mean that the label cannot be the vessel to provide tailored information toward patients' and health care professionals' needs. In current practice, there are venues in different (regulatory) decision‐making bodies 1  for patients and consumers, together with the scientific community and society at large, to express their views. Their rights and obligations as stakeholder are, however, not well defined, and therefore the impact of these stakeholders is not self‐evident. 2 
 Third, labels are subject to continuous monitoring and adjustment but are not sufficiently adaptive. In the current legal framework, safety signals, originating from any source, may find their way, through the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (in EU) into the label because of specific pharmacovigilance legislation. During the workshop, this was perceived as a one‐sided and skewed adaptiveness towards safety and limited because stakeholders other than the MAH, e.g. regulatory authorities or the scientific community, cannot add any information related to clinical effectiveness of a product. Evidence generation is not only done by pharmaceutical companies, but also, and increasingly so after marketing authorisation, by other organizations. Typical investigator driven research topics are the (appropriate) use, the dose, or new indications (drug rediscovery) of medicines. For this type of research, both interventional trials and observational studies in patient (outcome) registries or electronic health records are used. The results of these studies hardly lead to adjustments of the label, apart from the mentioned safety issues, as illustrated by the  5‐fluorouracil  (5FU) case and dose adjustment in the treatment of colorectal and breast cancer 3 ,  4  (see Box  2 ). The label change was based on safety considerations and a warning was added to the label in section 4.4. Likewise, a dose adjustment in section 4.2 of the label could have been decided on, provided both efficacy and safety issues of a product are considered of equal importance. Either way, the 5FU case demonstrates the need for a system that allows new information to be incorporated in the label based on both risk  and  benefit data of a drug. Most evidence generated from other sources than the MAH, as in the 5FU case, does find its way extensively into professional guidelines and patient information, based on published papers and conference presentations. It is considered a  lost opportunity , if these findings are not used constructively for refining the label. If we accept the label as the core data source for efficacy and safety of a drug throughout its life‐cycle, it is difficult to understand that it can only cover part of the information available. From the perspective of a pharmaceutical company, to take responsibility for the accuracy, quality and reliability of data generated by another stakeholder, outside of their span of control, requires a data environment of full transparency with regard to data quality, source, etc. 5  Such an environment is currently not in place. 
 BOX 2 The example of the 5‐fluorouracil (5FU) case and label adjustment 
 Dose adjustment based on an investigator driven study: the 5FU case 
 Fluoropyrimidines such as 5FU and capecitabine are widely used anticancer drugs for the treatment of colorectal cancer and breast cancer. The enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) plays a key role in fluoropyrimidine metabolism. DPD deficiency, which occurs in 3–5% of the population, is associated with increased risk of severe/fatal toxicity. Upfront screening and dose individualization can improve patient safety. The Dutch Cancer Institute (NKI‐AVL) took the initiative to conduct a prospective study to individualise the dose of fluoropyrimidines based on genotyping. 2 
 The results showed that DPYD*2A carriers had 2‐fold increased exposure to 5‐FU, meaning that a dose reduction of 50% would be sufficient to achieve the desired clinical effect. It was also shown that the genotype screening strategy did not increase the total costs. Based on these results and on the basis of a subsequent conducted meta‐analysis, a practical dosing table for dose‐adaptation for four different DPYD variants was developed. The data were published in 2016, but did not result in a change in the SmPC. As a follow‐up, the NKI‐AVL wrote a letter to European Medicines Agency in January 2017. Subsequently, DPD‐dependent dosing was discussed in the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee, with input from NKI‐AVL and the marketing authorisation holder, and in the PharmacogenomicsG Working Party, which resulted in a positive advice to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). In the end, after discussion with the marketing authorisation holder, the proposed rewording of section 4.4 of the SmPC was adopted. 
 Altogether, one could argue that in current practice, the label serves as target product profile for a marketing authorization and is not fully suitable as information source for patients and prescribers in daily practice. This position is rather monolithic and static, raising the question of whether, and how the label could be made suitable and sustainable as a future source of key drug information in a rapidly changing environment where the emphasis is on timely marketing authorization  vs  understanding the drug in clinical practice. 2 A SUSTAINABLE LABEL FOR THE FUTURE To make the label a state‐of‐the‐art document throughout the drug's life cycle, we propose that the process to come to a sustainable label for the future requires a model of shared stakeholders' responsibility. The MAH, regulatory authorities, patients/consumers, health care professionals and the scientific community all need to contribute. As a first step, we recognise the label as an essential document for granting the marketing authorization. The label is not only a crucial document for the applicant; it is also the basis for liability questions, and an important source for documents such as the patient information leaflet. It should therefore be reliable and up‐to‐date with respect to the safety and efficacy of the product itself, and not per se its application and use in daily practice as part of the therapeutic arsenal as a whole. This does not mean that the information at the time of marketing authorization cannot be optimized and more tailored towards user and prescriber needs. We expect that this optimization will find its way as a natural consequence of the patient/societal and scientific community engagement in the drug development process before and at the time of marketing authorization provided rights and obligations of the  new  stakeholders are well defined; the label as core product information document at the time of authorization. Once authorized, other aspects regarding clinical use should be specified in professional guidelines by medical professionals, e.g. by defining the product's place in clinical treatment regimens. We conclude that reliable and actual patient information should be based on professional guidelines with respect to treatment (options) at one end, and on the label with respect to product safety and efficacy information at the other end. This means that the different stakeholders involved in the development and maintenance of the label, and those involved in the development and maintenance of professional guidelines, should interact with each other and influence each other in an optimal way, inherent to the model of shared stakeholder's responsibility that we propose. Preferably, early interaction between different stakeholders, as foreseen in concepts, such as the priority medicines scheme PRIME, could be explored. In doing so we must realise that daily clinical practice differs significantly between countries and therefore, this process is not without challenge, and asks for a willing attitude towards harmonization. As part of our second step, we recognise that the label should follow the drug life cycle and should thus be apt to provide information acquired over time on efficacy and safety, based on a medicine's use in daily practice. Building a system where new information from different sources can fuel the label to become an up‐to‐date data source for the actual use of drugs in daily practice is paramount. However, criteria for the reviewing of these kind of data are needed. Any scientific progress, new regulatory requirements and new (clinical effectiveness) data that may come from additional phase 3 randomized controlled trials, phase 4 randomized controlled trials (e.g. outcome trials) and  real‐world evidence  (observational studies) can provide a new perspective on the efficacy and safety. The use of new types of data, including nonpropriety data from e.g. investigator‐initiated pharmacodynamics or drug–drug interaction studies, is useful to include in the label because it evaluates the use, and the benefits and risks of medicines in more clinically diverse settings and patients, and under conditions that reflect the use of treatments in actual clinical practice. There is a need for legislation or mandate for European Medicines Agency committees, to allow data from other stakeholders than the applicant, i.e. the MAH, to be reviewed—according to usual standards—and find its way into the drug label. Thus, we propose a scenario where the end goal is one that the label of the future should become a  balanced rolling document , i.e. suitable to contain sensible information about the product's efficacy and safety throughout its entire life‐cycle, from the time of marketing authorization. By  sensible , we mean that we accept that the information in the label at the time of marketing authorization can also be replaced by new information, if appropriate. We consider this a courageous step forward in efficient regulation; it is easier to add information to the label than to decide on redundancy. 6 
 3 CHALLENGES FOR A SHARED STAKEHOLDER APPROACH It is evident that the scenario described is not an easy way forward, but following the proposed developments, it offers the opportunity to focus discussions on the label in a stepwise approach: at the time of market authorization and when the drug is on the market and used in practice. For this approach to be successful, several challenges have to be addressed:
 We need to (re)define each stakeholder in practical and legal context within the current regulatory and legislative framework. There is a need for clarification of legal aspects within the current framework, e.g. liability issues. We need to decide on the use of  other  data, i.e. not directly obtained by the MAH, and define terms of data quality, transparency, data sources and access. We need a regulatory framework conducive to uptake of investigator initiated nontraditional data in the label. Finally, to further this process of regulatory innovation, we advocate two resolutions steps: (i) fuel discussions through the RSNN at European Medicines Agency level; and (ii) promote multi‐stakeholder regulatory research proposals in academia and beyond, e.g. participate in Innovative Medicines Initiative, IMI projects. 4 CONCLUDING REMARKS We asked ourselves questions such as: what should be the purpose of the  label of the future ? What kind of information should be included (or added) and what kind of information is redundant? Who should be the  owner  of the label and who can be responsible for the development and updating processes? We concluded on the need for a shared stakeholder's responsibility and drafted a scenario that covers a 2‐step approach, i.e. defining the label at the time of marketing authorization and thereafter. We identified potential (legal) barriers that need to be investigated, but, when further explored in the scientific regulatory community, may pave the way for next steps, making the label future‐proof.
